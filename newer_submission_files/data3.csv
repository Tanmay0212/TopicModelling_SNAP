11pms34,Advice," 

I have a friend who has two kids with a woman. 
They do an every other week thing. 

Except this woman, gets food stamps for these kids monthly. For an entire month. 

She will not buy food for dads house when they are with them. Even when he asks. She wants him to buy them from her. 

I have literally contacted DHS and told them this. And they couldn't give any fucks their system was being taken advantage of. None what so ever. 

This woman lets her mom and friends use or buy these food stamps. 

I continuously remind my friend to remind her that money is for THEIR KIDS. 

She then says he can apply for all the same benefits. Which isn't possible. And that she's a full-time parent so she gets full-time benefits, even though she only has those kids part time.

Is the extra $50 the emergency allotment people are talking about? Or would it be the $281? Cause I know on the CalFresh student portal it shows that students can earn up to $281. Are students exempt from this whole pandemic thing? (I applied not knowing about the emergency funds until I read up on it).

I was laid off and I‚Äôm looking for a new job. I applied for food stamps and was approved for 3 months ($251 month), but I also had to go see a case worker at the careersource  center.  For those who are under 50, not disabled with no children, you are required to do 80 hours a month of tasks of their choosing.

1. You see case worker every 2 weeks in person. You have to apply for 39 (yes 39) jobs every 2 weeks, you have to print out proof for each job you applied to (yes 39 separate pages, as well as write it all out on a form) and bring it to your meeting. If you don‚Äôt have a computer or internet you can go to the center and do it there.

2. You have to complete 20 hours of online education every week. You can choose from several topics - accounting, IT, healthcare, childcare, legal, etc. Again, if no computer you‚Äôll have to go to the center to do it 

3. You have to attend in person workshops monthly. I believe it‚Äôs mandatory to do at least 2. Job prep,  interview prep, resume help. Each workshop is at least an hour plus commute.

I understand the goal is to get a job. A lot of these things are helpful. But it‚Äôs a lot to do for $250 a month. Which barely helps. When you add up the 80 hours of online classes, the workshops, the 2x a month caseworker meetings‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs kind of ridiculous.

My brother is doing some classes and living with a relative (rent $475) and working an under the table job (so cash). It's common where he lives I think, dilapidated area. It's the only job he could get for the time being. It's paying him between $900-$1100 a month. Better than nothing at all, he'd probably be homeless without it. Our family is real shitty. I don't live anywhere near him and don't have money either so can't help him financially. He lives in PA and I live in Ohio. He has about $1100 total cash saved.

His public assistance was setup by a Church based services group last year. He didn't do it himself. They did the paperwork for him but they're gone (ended their assistance program I guess) now so they can't help him again with it.

When renewing his application for SNAP/Medicaid how does he report the cash income? A letter signed by the guy paying him? I'm not even sure the guy paying him will be willing to do that to be honest. The SNAP/Medicaid helps him a lot, without it he would barely have any money after paying rent and his other bills.

That was false. We got married at the end of 2018 and shortly after I removed myself from the marriage because we had problems. I went to stay with my mom for almost 2 weeks. He told me to come back to the home and he will go to his parents who live on the same property not even 20 ft from the home we have. We had an agreement that he would pay the mortgage and light bill as a ‚Äúchild support payment‚Äù in the beginning of 2019. Both homes had the same address, 1 mailbox for both. In 2020 I finally got a unit number for the home and my own mailbox; at this time it had already been 1 year and half at his mothers home. Anything the kids needed he would get he wasn‚Äôt supporting me any kind of way other than paying the rent and foodstamps new this and verified. In late 2020 he filed for a divorce and updated his mailing address to my unit because he wanted the papers to go to my mailbox. We co parented very well. Mid 2021 we had started talking back up again because during the divorce process he wasn‚Äôt sure if that was what he really wanted. We were both talking to other people at this time. I became pregnant and I didn‚Äôt know who the father was. So he waited until the baby was born and did a dna test and it was his so in 2022 we reconciled our relationship and I added him on my case that he was living in the home.

However, when I reported, they asked for when the effective date was, and because of the info they gave on what effective date is (when you start a job), that's the date I put in for it. 

However, I only received the income like at the very end of that month, rather than the start of it. Which means, if I put in the date of the effective date being the start of it (February), it's already been way over 10 days. But the date I actually received it was the very last day of February, which has only been about 8 days since and I decided to report before the 10 days.

(CA)","Okay so this happened last time we had benefits, I'm in California and the first time we did the SAR7 they claimed they didn't get it even thought I turned it in and sent them the email and screenshots of the website saying I did so.  
They admitted they didn't see it and asked me to fill it out again, did a huge run around with about five to eight different people giving us conflicting information on what and how to fill out everything to get the proper information they needed. Actually got into a screaming match over three different people in a row after a two hour hold time telling us different information, we could not get a straight answer. This went on for the whole month, some days we'd be on hold for two hours only to have them hang up on us or transfer us to a closed department. We even went IN PERSON and they still turned us away. So we ran out of time and reapplied.

Applying went just fine, got benefits on a new card with a new pin no problem. I was late to turning in February's SAR7 because I've been having MASSIVE technology issues. But I did turn it in on the 21st with all of the correct information that I was told to have unlike last time where I was missing a few things. I even went overboard and provided a written letter with resources showing my self employed income. 

I got a text a few days later I needed to upload documents showing that my disabled living had changed...? Which it *hasn't,* I didn't even select that it had on the website forms? So I sent a text back saying that I had nothing that I could upload as there have been 0 changes to medical/disabled living. I hear nothing back and our account still shows that it's active.   
I got a letter with no post date on it at all so I have no idea when it was sent saying they hadn't gotten our SAR7 by the 11th so our benefits would be discontinued. Our account still shows that it's active so I assumed it was sent before I had turned in my stuff.

Well we're supposed to be refreshed today, we've been starving for a few days cuz the only food bank near us is like three miles away and we don't have a car or a money for Lyft and walking is out due to me being disabled and my partner being injured, plus the only food bank near us actually requires a five dollar donation that we also don't have. So needless to say we've been excited to be able to eat again.

Nothing.   
I'm trying not to be frustrated but this is EXACTLY what happened last time but I made triple sure I had bank statements, proof of my payout days, separate highlight colors for one time gifts and my income, my written statement, screenshots of my self employed page, everything. I know I turned it in late but I read I had until the end of the month to do it and if I waited beyond that, then they would be stopped.

11kchrb,Question for eligibility expert/fraud department,"Serious question for anyone who may work in the eligibility or fraud department. I have been on foodstamps/medicaid for a lot of years. Single parent, usually work full time, just don't make enough to get by. I have always reported my income in a timely manner, however, I believe I have made a mistake in reporting starting back 18 months ago. I usually work through a temp service. One of the jobs I was placed at from 8/2021 to 6/2022 gave me bonuses. I thought they were included on my paystub with the temp service. I have received bonuses from other jobs with the temp service in the past and they were always shown on my paystubs with the temp service. At the end of the year 2021 I received a 1099 NEC showing $1,500. I did not realize what it was, I just took papers to nationwide tax preparer and they did my taxes. I vaguely remember the tax preparer asking me if I had business expenses and told him I did not because I do not have a business. Thought nothing of it. Fast forward to this year and again I received a 1099 NEC for $2,400 from the same company. I went to a different nationwide tax preparer and did my taxes. This time the tax preparer explained to me that it was basically a self employment form and that  income was not included on my W-2 from the temp service. So now I realize it was not included on my prior pay stubs that I turned in to job and family services either. So I have 2 years of self employment not reported to Job and Family services for my food stamps and Medicaid. IT GETS WORSE. In 2021 I applied for pandemic unemployment. I was approved, but never received it.  I had a pending issue I had an appeal on. It took them until last year/2022 to finally pay me. I received 2 lump sum payments. In the early part of the year I received a lump sum for what was considered  backpay when I first applied for umemployment in 2021. In the later part of the year I received an additional lump sum for what were considered current weeks when I applied in 2021. I did not report either lump sum payment from unemployment because I thought job and family services already knew about those payments. SNAP, medicaid, cash assistance, and unemployment are all part of job and family services. I talked to someone at job and family last week under anonymity and they told me they do not know about the unemployment payments and I would have had to inform them. SHOCK set in. I was not expecting to hear that.  So now in total I have about $14,000 in income I never reported to job and family services. It's not like I make a lot. In 2021 I made $12000 to $14000- thats including the ""self employment"" and last year I made $13,000 to 14,000 including the ""self employment"" then the $10,000+ from lump sum unemployment. I was unemployed part of the year due to an injury and subsequent surgery.  My 19 yo son also worked last year, while I was unemployed/recovering from surgery. He made $7,000. His income was reported. So total household income was around $30,000 to $32,000. We are a family of three as I also have a 17 yo son. I want to correct this with Job and Family services as I know it was a mistake and should have been reported. I am currently not under any sort of investigation, but I do not feel right about receiving overpayment for SNAP. 
So I'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this. Do I just call and tell my worker? Should I speak to a lawyer first because I fear once I report it's going to become a legal issue?  I am worried about getting in trouble or my 19 about to be 20 yo being held accountable for my mistake. I have done some research online and I'm confused as to weather he or my 17 yo will have to share in the cost of snap repayment. I see it says any adult on the case 18 or over is reponsible for overpayment, but also see it says anyone under 22 is excluded/not counted as an adult if they lived with a parent. Obviously my kids are not filling out paperwork or signing forms I am. I know I will have to pay back all SNAP overpayment and probably be disqualified meaning we won't get food stamps any longer.  I am MOSTLY concerned about being over eligibility for medicaid or charged with fraud for snap or medicaid. I can't imagine how much it would cost to pay  back medicaid with all the procedures, surgery, physical therapy, etc I have had. If I have to pay the rest of my life I guess I will, but I do not want my children to have to pay for my mistakes. That's not a good way to start their young lives. Can anyone help with this? I need advice. Anyone have a similar situation? All the info I see online for people being charged with medicaid fraud only talks about doctors, hospitals, or people charging for services getting in trouble. Not someone in my situation. Please do not make me feel any worse than I already do. I have not been able to sleep since friday when I did my taxes and realized my error.",privacymatters2day,1678133616.0,foodstamps

My first SNAP renewal was automatic. I got the letter in the mail stating that it would be from 12/1/22 to 5/31/23. I started my new job on 12/5/22.

 I called to have my Medicaid canceled because my insurance would begin sometime in January 2023. They had me send an email to the worker I was on the phone with and told me it would be canceled. I think I also received something in the mail about cancelation. 

After my first paycheck I called to report my income change and stated that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP. The worker asked for my identifying info and just confirmed that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP benefits. They didn't ask for verification of my increased income though. I thought everything was handed.

Well yesterday I received a letter about the extra benefits stopping. I didn't think much of it. Today, while placing an order for my groceries I just got the feeling to check the balance. So I've received benefits (plus the extras) from Jan & Feb 2023. 

I didn't spend any of it and I plan on calling them monday morning. I know that I didn't do anything wrong/illegal but I just don't want to be investigated. Especially since my new job is with the county (athough different departments).

11gcs2r,Access HRA app and trouble uploading documents,"I'm applying in New York and having trouble getting the Access HRA app to recognize my documentation, and was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and knows what to do.

The primary issue is all of my documents are in PDF form, but the Access HRA app only allows you to ""Take a Photo"" or ""Select a Photo."" PDFs appear to not be recognized.

Initially I assumed this just meant I needed to convert the PDFs to jpgs, which are recognized by the Access HRA app. Access HRA is able to see the .jpgs in my phone's camera folder, in my screenshot folder.... virtually, all jpgs.

But when I converted my PDFs to jpgs and saved them to those same folders, the Access HRA app still can't find them. I tried PNG files too, just to see if that changed it, but there's still no luck.

I'm 100% certain the newly made and converted files are in the correct folders. I've even tried things like moving them to the screenshots folder, where I can see the Access HRA app allows me to select from, but the app for some reason just doesn't recognize the documentation. Frustratingly, it does recognize new photos, new screenshots.

I've reset my phone several times and logged in and out of the app even more times, but this hasn't helped.

Either way it won't matter to me because it's better for me both ways but I also realize it is actually better if my medical case stays under my mom, both for the keeping of the address benefit and also so I wouldn't have to do the medical application all over, I have a good feeling this would be the case, but since I did tell them I was under abusive circumstances (over 18 her, 25 to be exact) I wonder if they used this info in their decision to possibly take me off everything, which again can only be a benefit for me since it'd be better to have everything under my  case for the future, I am about to call right now and find out anyways.

 The only underlying factor I would mention about wanting the case to be completely under me would be so I don't have any hardship in the future if my mother tries to claim I'm mentally ill and cannot be taken off unless her authorization allows it (I doubt they would approve that without proof from me ) and I wouldn't doubt my mother from taking those steps in the future even if she hasn't so far, she is the type to threaten herself with injury so the cops will believe her over me or anyone else in the household anyway, she's done it before so I'd rather not let history repeat itself in that regard with something she could control like that, I don't have my own place currently that's why I'm applying for assistance to get the ball rolling and because I really need food right now.",associatebubbly7981,1677715975.0,foodstamps

11c07l9,"PA-SNAP questions, rent change, income change","Trying to help my cousin figure this stuff out. It's somewhat confusing. My cousin is living with a friend (old man) since late 2021. Hasn't been paying rent due to man being nice and also helping him with stuff (he's done a lot for him). No job, has been dealing with a lot of health issues (hospitalized a bunch of times but is much better now). Has SNAP and Medicaid. SNAP is maxed out I believe like $281 a month. Food money obviously helps a lot. Medication is $1 a month rather than $45 a month. Originally he didn't use the SNAP for like 9 months or something because his Uncle's gave him a ton of frozen and canned food. Surprised they never canceled it. 

Old man is very sick now (physically and mentally-dementia) and he can't live there anymore. Old man is getting really crazy. Has to find a new place asap. Like as soon as humanly possible. Room is filling with sewage daily when water is run too long. He's going to get sick. Main line is broken or something. Old man doesn't care and cousin can't fix it. And he's getting really crazy and accusatory (accusing him of crazy stuff he didn't do) and threatening him. He could end up sleeping in his car. 

Cousin has a friend who lives in a nice, small, but cheap apartment not too far away. Only $700 utilities included. They have one unit left. They're going to let him in it soon seems like because of his personal connection. He also found a stopgap job for some income. Guy is going to let him tag along and help cut grass with him starting in March and pay him cash. Sounds like he'll make around $1200 a month doing that. Not a lot of hours, 20 something a week. Not much but better than nothing. 

Should he call his caseworker to report this now? Or mail something instead to them? Does anyone know how this will affect his monthly SNAP payment? Medicaid? Thanks.",equivalent_alps_8321,1677370535.0,foodstamps

I'm in Washington State. I recently found out that you could order groceries on Instacart and pay with EBT. While going over the receipt to see the charges today, I noticed that I was charged for bags and a bag tax. If you guys don't know, any person receiving any type of public assistance is exempt from the bag fees and taxes.

When I called to speak to them, they said they do not offer refunds and that I needed to look at the fine print for this. Hung up the call, then went to create an order to see the fine print. This is what it says: "" A bag fee may be added to your final total if required by law or the retailer. The fee will be visible on your receipt after delivery. ""

I called them back to ask again. The next person I got continued to tell me the same thing, however, after checking on the [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov) website this is what it says under exceptions:

* The fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Food Assistance Program (FAP).

The person put me on hold, and then came back to tell me that upon review, they will give me a refund ""this time"" and all I needed to do was send them an email at the generic 'help' email address. If you have used this service, check your receipts.",latinashrty,1677286188.0,foodstamps

11awtl5,MI SNAP (& Medicaid) case worker denying self-employment cost of goods sold expenses that weren't purchased recently.,"Accounting 101: When a business (or person operating as a sole proprietorship) purchases inventory for the purpose of resale, it's not an expense.  The business is exchanging one asset (i.e. cash) for another asset (inventory.)  The cost of the inventory is only an expense once it is sold.

Until about 3 years ago, I had self-employment income from reselling products online and submitted monthly Michigan DHS-431 statements with copies of receipts for all expenses, including for the actual inventory sold during that period.

After about 3 years without self-employment income, I started selling online again.  I timely filed my notice of change of income and started submitting monthly DHS-431 statements before even hearing back from my caseworker.  They just sent me a notice saying my ""old"" merchandise expenses can't be used as verification for current expenses.

Obviously, I can't submit old non-inventory expenses, but inventory is just different.  Maybe she doesn't understand the invoices provided are for the actual inventory I just sold, but I'm pretty sure she's now thinking I can only deduct inventory expenses if it's purchased in the period the DHS-431 covers, or at least is fairly recent.  That's just not how it works.  The same caseworker years ago accepted inventory receipts that were years old without a problem.  :-(  I understand they're not trained accountants.

I'm writing a letter back, and I'm struggling to justify my position with a slam-dunk that will hopefully avoid yet another administrative appeal.  Michigan BEM 502 is for self-employed income, and pg 3 says ""Countable income from self-employment equals the total proceeds minus allowable expenses of producing the income... Allowable expenses include all of the following: Identifiable expenses of labor, stock, raw, material, seed, fertilizer, etc...""  I can argue that especially because I sell many types of products and few quantities of each, that I can easily identify the expense of my stock with an invoice, even though it's years old.  Many of the invoices are for the only time I've purchased that specific item.  But, the BEM doesn't go into further details for timing of expenses for COGS.

BEM 502 refers to 7 CFR 273.9(c)(9).  (Well, it refers to 7 CFR 273.9.1 in a typo because that doesn't exist.)  This CFR refers to 7 CFR 273.11(b)(1) which has the language BEM 502 copied pretty much word for word.  But, neither of these CFR's or any related ones spell out the timing of expenses for COGS.  I searched Michigan and federal caselaw, and found no on-topic cases about these regulations.

Is there anything else I can include, like authoritative sources, to try to avoid having to go through an administrative appeal?  I mean, I can include source authoritative for accounting and taxation about the timing of deducting inventory, but I'm hoping for something more on point.

Note BEM 502 does allow a new business (or perhaps one with a substantial change in business income) to file an estimated Schedule C, even if not actually filed, but that's listed as a Medicaid verification source only -- not food stamps.  I know I'll have to give an estimated Schedule C for Medicaid since the DHS-431 isn't usable for that, but I'm just pointing out submitting an estimated Schedule C doesn't fix my food stamp issue.",select-weekend-1549,1677259572.0,foodstamps

11aa2um,Proof of Employment,Ok so i am in a lot of need for help because i am a student doing my basics in the morning and studying a trade in the evening. My mother has to renew her food stamps application but they asked me to give a proof of employment form. I worked at walmart last year but I quit without notice and I heard there is a new manager there. So how would i get that form done? And also why do they need all of that can't they just look at the income I earned through some other way like a tax form?

11a9gqe,I‚Äôm almost 24 and make up to only $150 a month selling art online due to being too mentally ill to work. But I live with my parents. Could I be qualified for food stamps for just myself?,"I‚Äôve read up on it but I‚Äôm still confused. Some say you have to count the entire household income (which my dad makes around $70k a year) so I‚Äôm SURE that would disqualify me. But others say if you‚Äôre over 22, you can be your own ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù. You may ask, why get food stamps if your dad makes good money? They already have to pay for so much for my medical bills/medications/therapy and they‚Äôre going into debt over random problems that keep popping up. I really want to be able to provide food for myself.

 (I‚Äôve also been trying to get on disability because I over-qualify for that lmao but I keep getting rejected even though I‚Äôm autistic, bipolar, severely anxious, depressed, and have ptsd) so at the least I wanted to try to get on food stamps

I reported the income increase then a few months later in May of 2022, I moved to Mississippi and also reported the address change.

I knew I'd be able to pay back $200 if it came down to them saying it wasn't mine to spend, but I didn't use it again after that. 

Now it's been 8 months since I've used the card, but I just received a letter (to my new Mississippi address) from Alabama food assistance offices letting me know I have benefits that they, quote ""encourage me to use"" before they expire in 30 days. I checked my balance to find $1100 on there. I know I hadn't been using it all monthly even prior to the income increase since I lived alone.

Fast forward to this January he lost his job and we agreed he could stay here again to help with the kids while I went to work full time again. I reported this on my case and added him to the household.

I am a pregnant stay at home mom, living by myself.
I don‚Äôt have income right now, and rely on help here and there from people, little bit of money I had, etc. The father of both my children has been paying for the water and power for us to live in his family home instead of child support.

My question is: 1.) It asks me if anyone pays part, or all of the bills. Should I put his name? And if I do, what does that mean: do they count that as income for me? 2.) would it be better to have him send me money for child support instead of the bills diapers thing? Do they count child support as income? 

I have more questions, but I‚Äôll start there. Like a lot of others I see, I have to reapply basically now for March. They didn‚Äôt send me anything, but it says reapply online. I t gives me so much anxiety because I desperately need the help, more than ever. I think most people do, which is what‚Äôs so crazy about the timing of all this.

114wlt0,Can inform me about my options.?,"Hello everyone about CA EBT rules and regulations due to the fact that I have been under my mom\\s case since I\\m guessing the start of the pandemic, I'm trying to find information on whether or not if someone else is in the same circumstances that I am in, I have called repeatedly to get my case separated in the state of California, but I am repeatedly told I cannot separate my case because I'm under hers. I don\\t understand because I have done this before the pandemic, is this something that started when the pandemic came about or is it because of the pandemic relief extra money they have been allotting to people that is set to expire next month? 

Even so I still don\\t understand why that would prevent me from separating my case from hers, my guess and this is only a guess is that it's easier for the county to not over allot extra payments to people? But I find that ridiculous cause everything is in their system, so they\\d be the ones controlling what's happening not me?

&#x200B;

The reason I'm asking is because I am not on speaking terms with my mother and it\\s a very challenging process to even deal with her so for a while now I have not been going to her for cash aid, instead relying on my stimulus payments. It's a long story but basically, I informed EDD/DPSS of this and they said they would send an escalation notice to the worker and within 3 business days I should hear back from them. I made this call on a Friday and checked back Monday even though I was told they would call me, no one answered, so I managed to call back the 3rd day and finally got someone on the phone who informed me my case was\\t able to be separated (they gave no reason or said it was part of their rules) but they kept saying I could be separated but only by her which made me more confused?! Because WHY? 

&#x200B;

They guy who told me to just wait till benefits ran out next month then I could apply on my own sent the escalation ticket when I informed him, she can be very confrontational and abusive so that is why I wasn't keen on asking for access from the card from her. I promptly informed him I been using my own savings for food ( I know that might not matter because benefits were allotted to all of us, I don\\t want the missing benefits I just want the case to be under my name so I don't have to use her card or go to her for those benefits that she's getting but I'm not even using for myself and yes it's fine if they restart my case with no money except for what\\s generally allotted.)

&#x200B;

So once I informed him of this circumstance that's when he found it necessary to issue an escalation notice to the eligibility workers, so I called and was told all of that basically and that I informed them I wanted my case separated but no one had called me yet so  she said she would submit it again for the second time but this time I noted she said I would have to keep up with them (I'm not foregoing the possibility the first guy told me that, but I am strongly in belief that was not the case the first time around) so I said okay, 

&#x200B;

I then asked some follow up questions I the event that would be denied anyways for whatever rules are in place, I asked the person I was speaking with if it's possible to get a separate EBT card to use under her case instead of a replacement that way I could access the benefits to instead of going directly to her for the card. 

&#x200B;

I was then told that it was an option unbeknownst to me at the time because no one had ever told me this before that the main case holder can do that by filling out a simple form that's available and submitting it to the office. (WHAT!?)

&#x200B;

You mean to tell me I could've had access to our benefits the entire time we were receiving them without having to go through the main case holder?!

&#x200B;

It still doesn't make sense why it\\s limited to her authorization only. The only reason I could think of is because she was the main one that filed and claimed me at the time for being under her case.  But even so it's ridiculous to tell me that I can't separate myself from her unless she wants it.

&#x200B;

Is it possible she made me out to be unable to care for myself and perhaps made it so that I wouldn't be able to separate myself? I am not one to jump to conclusions like that so easily, I am wondering if that's something EDD/DPSS does though? Because if so, I had no idea of that status of myself while on her case nor did I ever authorize her to do something like that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, in simplicity all I'm asking is whether someone knows in depth about how the case are being affected right now due to the pandemic and if they know they are doing this for everyone? Is there a way around this? I am in Los Angeles County by the way. Is anyone in similar situation? What advice do you recommend to me?

&#x200B;

Note: Please be kind and do not suggest I start talking to my mother, it is a personal situation and I understand not everyone will understand (or care for that matter) but as of right now it is not an option unless absolutely necessary and the only two scenarios, I can see something like that happening is if either:

1. I inform her and request to be separated from her benefits case.
2. I ask her to fill out the secondary EBT card authorization form and submit it to tithe office so I can get my own card to use my portion of the benefits with.

I\\d like to know if anyone is in a similar situation?",independent_walk_581,1676665429.0,foodstamps

112ikdi,Which way is better?,"Hi everyone!

This is probably a weird question. I've been living with family for years but have been getting food stamps. I explained that I buy food and eat separately from them, which is the truth, and they granted me a decent amount per month. But it was my mom's house and she passed away not long ago. If I stay there I'm stuck living with my sister, her daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend. It's too small there and I hate the overall atmosphere.

I have a fianc√© who was living in a medical rehab center after having a stroke. He was recently discharged and we have gotten a low income apartment together. It's illegal for me to use my food stamps to buy food for both of us, so we need to apply for him to get them too. Here is where my question comes in.

I have zero income. He has a military pension which isn't much but it's enough to pay our subsidized rent. He is still way below the poverty line and should be eligible for something. The dilemma is, how do we apply?

Should I tell them I'm moving in with him and then we apply as a couple? Or should we make an application for him alone and buy our food separately? Will aligning myself with another person take away my benefits, even if that other person is also low income? Has anyone here ever been in this situation? What did you do? How did it turn out?

In January, a friend helped me with applying for SSDI, Food Assistance, and Medicaid. Yesterday I got a call from DCF to do my phone interview, and the worker said that I would need to fill out a job contacts form; from what I can see, it looks like it's asking me to apply for 20 jobs and write the contact information for all of them, and then turn in the form to DCF by 02/20/2023. I can try to apply for jobs, but that seems irresponsible knowing that I will be unable to work if I receive an offer. If I knew I could work, I would just go back to my previous job. I asked the worker if it was absolutely necessary for me to fill out the job contacts form in order to receive assistance, and she didn't give me a straight answer. Is there a specific way I should phrase this concern? Should I try again with a different worker?

&#x200B;

UPDATE 02/17/2023:  What ended up working was uploading the confirmation that I had applied for SSDI to the DCF online portal and then waiting on hold (yesterday 02/16/23 it took 6 hours and 19 minutes starting at 8:00 AM, in case anyone from KS is curious about the hold time to talk to a case worker) to explain that I had applied for disability benefits and I couldn't work at this time, so I wouldn't be able to turn in the job contacts form by/on 02/20/2023. The case worker was able to remove the job contacts form requirement and have my case approved!

10ycz1r,Confused about household rules,"California, San Diego County. 

I live with my ex spouse (we are both women), who is disabled on SSI, we separated and divorced in 2018. We have two kids. She lives in our home, in her own room, does not buy or prepare food with anyone (she actually has a provider who comes help her with that), and our finances are separate. 

She only gets $1000 a month from SSI with her rent of $650, utilities added, car insurance, gas, etc. It leaves her with about $10 a week for food. She has to wait for the once a month when some neighbors bring some expired leftover food from stores that only last her about 3 days because the portions are very limited. This isn‚Äôt enough for her! She can‚Äôt do anything with the kids because she has no money. 

I am not responsible for her financially or in any way. I do not want to have to buy her food when I can barely afford my own for me and the kids!

But while she qualifies for calfresh on her own, they are refusing to separate the household despite the above facts. Can someone explain the logic to me? If anything, I believe she needs them more having kids in the home she can‚Äôt financially support during her visitation time. What is she supposed to do? There is nowhere else for her to move with her income so low, but she shouldn‚Äôt be starving because of this rule, nor should I be forced to buy her food (I‚Äôm actually not allowed to) when my budget is already so tight for having to pay for everything for the kids and paying more rent too.

For example, are cold rotisserie chickens allowed?  What about salad bars within a grocery store?  Is hot soup rejected?  What about gazpacho from the same soup bar?  Is there something that you're sure was eligible that was rejected?

10xqj92,question about work requirements,"hello, sorry to be a bother but currently I have a very particular question. my brothers wife was receiving snap benefits In Texas, they are married but living separately due to some family issues so he hasn't been on the benefits just her and his son. now, he's planning on moving her in with him and applying for benefit for the three of them. my question is, currently they both don't work they are both going to school, he takes care of our mother in exchange for rent, that is a daily thing and is sometimes there anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week. my mother is disabled and is considered a separate household. with that said they make do with their fafsa to cover bills, would they still be eligible for benefits? and would he still have to worry about the work requirements? or could he be considered self employed as he technically works for our mother as a caretaker in exchange for rent. the wife again is going to school as well and takes care of their 6 year old while also homeschooling him. due to this she isn't able to cover childcare or get childcare so she can work. 

thank you for reading and again sorry for the bother. any help or consideration would be very much helpful.",shadixmax,1675934857.0,foodstamps

10xm7s1,Need Food Stamp Advice Please (Florida),"Hi there. I've had food stamps for a while and have never gotten an E&T notice. I submitted my renewed food stamps application and on my application my hours were different from my paystubs which I explained are because my work is cutting peoples hours due to lack of business. I received a E&T notice in the mail that it was mandatory for me to participate since I didn't meet the work requirement. I forgot to add on my application that I work roughly 20 hours a week online for a remote job that pays me pennies, but still the work is being put in and I honestly didn't add it to the application because I didn't think it counted. I ended up trying to submit a ""good cause"" addendum to my application stating that and then panicked and closed my case because I didn't know what to do.

&#x200B;

My question is, since I didn't sign up for the E&T program (the deadline didn't happen yet) will something happen since I canceled my account? Will the food stamps money that I received for this month of food stamps be revoked? Any advice is extremely appreciated, this has never happened before and I'm scared because I have never been able to contact a representative for a question and since the interviews are waived right now it's even more impossible.

How does the reapplication process actually work and will it be okay if I just miss this interview, let the benefits stop and reapply that way with different caseworker later on? 

Firstly, I have anxiety. Last time I spoke with this particular caseworker, she was quite condescending, judgmental and withheld a specific task that needed to be completed for my application to be approved, resulting in a my application being denied. I had to speak with another caseworker to actually process my application correctly. In addition to the information that I correctly submitted, she simply needed to call a family member to verify who was in my household (she did not tell me this. at all.) and in her own way, told me to get a job. I don‚Äôt want to go through that again. My first caseworker and the nice older man who got my application properly submitted were angels to me.

From how I understand it (based on [this memo](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/end-of-temporary-student-exemptions-caa)), the covid PHE expires May 11, which means any recertification until June 30 will still qualify for the EFC=0 waiver.

10tk4uo,Anyone in Los Angeles that didn't get the emergency allotment that was scheduled for literally today?,"According to this form, CalSAWS counties (of which Los Angeles County is part of) are supposed to get the extra $95 *today*. It usually comes on almost immediately after midnight, so I'm kind of concerned because it's 8 in the morning and I still don't have it.

I know it's supposed to be the 2nd to last emergency allotment (March is the last month we're getting the $95 in California).


I can confirm that I am *not* due for a recertification. Even *if* I was, I would still get the extra $95 (because I *still got it* when I had to recertify last year; the recertification did not delay or ""cancel"" the extra $95).

Living in NJ

Have vacant residential property in PA(Philadelphia)

I work salary is $60,600

Wife not working was layed off

One son working living with his girlfriend but still uses our mailing address. His salary is $48,300

Other son works 30 hours a week. He can‚Äôt work more because of mental illness. We had a hearing for SSI but they didn‚Äôt give him continued benefits. His salary is $16,000.

Son that works 30 hours a week is thinking about moving into a property we own in another state not too far from primary home. 

Couple of questions. Since we are struggling financially would son working 30 hours a week be eligible for food assistance? Or food assistance for the household? 

My take home salary after deductions is $34,000 and sons take home is $13,000. However our monthly expenses are $60,000 including everything. So as you can see even with combined income we are short.

Has anyone else in Texas experienced this? Getting extra deposits or way more than you're supposed to? What did you do?

10o5qtk,An error?,"I‚Äôm curious how common overpayment is on Texas SNAP. I had a hell of a time last year applying. Got denied about 2 times before getting approved. Since September of last year I had a pending application, that eventually got approved because the hospital here in town put in a Medicaid application in for my son, and got approved the next day. 

Got my first deposit early January, it was $1,700 in stamps. Initially, I thought that was weird and assumed it was pro-rated from applying back in September. Backpay. 

The only way I can justify the $1.7k is that when I initially saw I was approved, I saw it was ‚Äùapproved‚Äù back in September, with a renewal date in February. Which later updated to starting 02/01 with renewal in August. The amount, the math, amount of months, it added up and that‚Äôs why I assumed it was correct. But there‚Äôs definitely an error.

Now, I‚Äôm thinking there has to be an error in the system. I got my usual deposit on the 26th of $506 (my first deposit, outside of that random $1.7k at the beginning of the month), which is the amount that I‚Äôm to get each month, which is fine and I‚Äôm more than okay with that. However, the next day, I got another deposit, which was in various deposits adding up to $1,251. That‚Äôs not right. Especially with a family of 3. 

I‚Äôm obviously going to call because there has to be an error and I‚Äôm not trying to commit fraud or get benefits that don‚Äôt belong to me. I‚Äôm wondering if anything like this has happened to anyone here and what the outcome was?

 This wasn‚Äôt deliberate on my part, like I said, I‚Äôm not trying to commit fraud. Has to be an error through Texas HHSC, and Monday morning I‚Äôm calling them.

10mvrzl,Why do people turn down the $23 in benefits?,"Please, if you have a moment‚Ä¶I sincerely want to understand this line of thinking. I promise you I am not being sarcastic, but I just don‚Äôt understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù?  I genuinely want to know. 

The current minimum SNAP benefit is $23. This is what most seniors receive. I hate that and I agree that is not enough. Obviously that‚Äôs not enough. But if you are hungry why would you turn down $23? The food pantry is not enough. If you are having trouble affording food, why turn down help?

Personally, I don‚Äôt qualify for anything anymore. But I think of it like, if a grocery store were to give me a $23 gift card every month I would love that. Even now, when I can afford to pay on my own. I would absolutely love a $23 bonus. 

Obviously it‚Äôs not enough to feed myself or my family but it‚Äôs enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs, bread, and milk. I see it as that‚Äôs $23 of my own money that I don‚Äôt have to spend on groceries. So that‚Äôs $23 more every month that could go towards bills, prescriptions, or whatever. 

I especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $23 because it‚Äôs not enough (which I agree) but then struggle to afford their meds, skip meals , pay late fees on their bills because they were $10 short, have $35 withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc. I know $23 is not enough, and I know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $23 is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount. 

Please help explain why so many people, especially seniors, turn down this benefit. I genuinely do not understand.",true_owl370,1674852883.0,foodstamps

I just received a Notice of Calfresh Approval *and* Denial in the same mailing. Because I also received a card separately, hopefully I was approved? ü•π

My questions are about the current income shown and how to adjust it. The approval amount is for $23/mo, and it shows my income as $1950.30 and my IRT as n/a. When I applied I used old pay stubs, because I was just laid off, so the amount is much higher than my actual income. Since then, my only income has been a small amount from EDD, so my monthly income is not reflected accurately. 

- Is it possible to update the income to reflect the actual amount that is well under the amount reported? If so, what‚Äôs the best way to do that? Does this require an appeal, or can I call or submit an update somehow? 
- Does EDD payment count as income?

Everyone I know is struggling right now. Food prices are just so so high. I check the circulars each week and certain foods (eggs, bread) will not go on sale.

I applied for benefits in NY but I havent heard back yet. I received a one-time payment, but no approval. is that a sign that something is wrong? It's never taken this long before so it's making me nervous. Should I be worried? If you only receive the one-time payment does that mean you won't get the extra for January?

10khgju,How are CalFresh SNAP benefits calculated? Just got a letter saying my benefits are decreasing and the lady on the phone didn't help at all lol.,"Even if you are below the income limit is it possible to receive less than the maximum amount? 

I get SSI, and I was getting $281.  I just got a letter saying as of 2/1/2023 my benefits are going to be lowered to $226.  

I just got off the phone with them because I was trying to get more information and the woman literally didn't know anything lol.  At first she says ""oh everyone got that letter it's just about the emergency allottment ending.""  Then I was like well the letter says it is because of a change in my income, and she says ""oh that's what everyone's letter says."" And then I said ""well it doesn't add up to $95."" 

And finally she said oh well did your income change? I said my SSI went up from like $930 to $1250 due to changes to my housing and the COLA.  

Then she said ""oh ok that's the reason.""  

Then I was like well can you look in the computer and tell me exactly what it was? And she looked and was like ""there is no recent note in here so I don't know."" 

Then I try to ask ""well what income amount makes you eligible for the full $281?"" And she said ""oh I don't know we just put the numbers in the system, we don't give out that information.""   

So I am left still wondering whether or not my income increasing was the actual reason for the decrease. 

Also, in March SSI plans to reduce my SSI amount by $120 a month, and I asked her if Calfresh will update my amount automatically, and she said no, they only do it every 6 months I'd have to report it or something. She was very unclear. 

I have looked into it and I think that they have a standard deduction.  I also pay $850 a month in rent, can I get that deducted too? 

This reduction to my foodstamps along with the removal of the emergency allotment will seriously affect me. 

Does anyone have any idea of the scale of income that they use? Like what is it? 

Like is it if you make $1,000 or less you get the full $281 CalFresh. 

But if you make $1,100 you get $250 CalFresh

And if you make $1,200 you get $220 CalFresh

Like that, does anyone know what the actual scale is??? The woman on the phone wouldn't tell me lol I'm so confused

My parents (Dad 67, Mom 63) will be closing their small business soon and not be making any income by the end of this month. (Also they live alone, their children do not live with them).

What was confusing me was that on this website stating that you would need your bank balance of checkings and savings to be under $3001.

But when I looked at the USDA website https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1312

10ijb6b,PA snap - employer refusing to give termination letter,"Not my situation, but posting here for a friend who doesn‚Äôt have Reddit. 

He had food stamps two years ago and left the job he had when he was initially approved for them. He didn‚Äôt update the county that he found a new employer and got cut off which was fine because he could afford to feed himself then with his new job at the time. He didn‚Äôt think he would be approved anyway. 

He is applying again and the county is still asking for the termination letter from when he left that first job two years ago. 

His old job has a change of manager and when he checks in again for the letter he explains short-hand that the main reason he left was due to finding better pay over the time-limited brief phone call he had. They were confused why he was only an employee for two weeks and why he would need this. 

He later explains after getting an email to contact (& able to provide more detail)  that that the reason why he was an employee for only two weeks was because he couldn‚Äôt secure training hours with the previous management, forcing him to continue his job search which lead him to getting better pay than what the job was offering him. 

New manager is now refusing to fill out paperwork and accusing him of wanting them to falsify records because he didn‚Äôt say that over the phone, so they‚Äôre not going to do it.

He just tells them they can verify with the previous managers what his hours were and why he left.

The question is does it matter if they put he found better wages or if he couldn‚Äôt get training hours? He left a full two years ago and he is employed full-time elsewhere. He would not be receiving unemployment benefits, the county just needs notice from the employer that he isn‚Äôt an employee of that company anymore. The letter they need to sign is dated for 2021 as well. 

Is there any work around for this if an employer is not cooperating? What can he do?

This is in California. 

I am on SSI, my husband is pending his SSI and not workin. I was getting $1140 a month and $363 for food stamps.

With COLA I now get $1251.00 as of Jan 1. That caused our food stamps to go down to 315. That sucked but okay I can handle it. 

Then, we get a notice that they've gone down to $208 because we no longer pay rent (we bought our property, but our utility costs have gone up, and we live in rural area so gas to get anywhere is more, we can't walk anywhere like in the city, going to the Dr is 160 miles round trip. For example. We pay propane water gas charcoal (no cooking facilities), phone, and medical expenses, car insurance, property taxes. 

So the only expense we no longer have is rent.  But everything else went up. 

Somehow that took our food stamps from 315 to 208.

On the benefits change notice though the income they put is the same, the deductions are the same, expenses listed is the same only difference is the amount of the food stamps.

10hagcc,NJ SNAP issues/questions,"I had SNAP benefits in Atlantic County, NJ. I moved to Burlington County and was told that (despite my benefits being discontinued prior) that I had to have my still-active Atlantic County case closed before I could apply in Burlington County.

I contacted Atlantic County, was never able to speak to an actual person, but left countless messages asking to have my call returned. It took them 5 months to call me back, for a five minute conversation asking my case to be closed, then another month for them to actually close it.

I applied to Burlington, received the packet, sent it back and just got off the phone with them (called for status update) and was told that after receiving everything back it could take another few *months* to actually receive my card, benefits. I asked if there was any way to get expedited benefits, they said no.

I read on LSNJLAW
[https://www.lsnjlaw.org/government-aid-services/food-hunger-nutrition/food-stamps/pages/snap-nj-food-stamp-program.aspx]:

>If you qualify for food stamps/SNAP, you should get them no later than 30 days from the date the office got your application.

>If your household has little or no money and needs help right away, you may be eligible for expedited food stamps/SNAP. This means that the food stamp/SNAP office must give you food stamps/SNAP within seven days of the date you apply.

So - NJLSW contradicts what I was told by BCSS about how long it takes to receive benefits and the existence of expedited benefits.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced applying (in Burlington County or elsewhere with a similar situation) and if their experience reflected what I was told by BCSS.

I'm freaking out - disabled, two kids, can't drive (so can't get to food pantries) and have been overdrafting my bank account every month just to buy food. I'm $500 in the negative with fees mounting daily and have no food. I'm really at the end of my rope.

Any suggestions, information, etc would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

10gey02,Can I rant about CalWorks for a sec???,"I didnt see anywhere else to post this so I figured I would add it here.. 

So long story short I have state benefits (Calfresh/Medi-Cal) bc I'm pregnant and had to leave my job bc this journey has been ROUGH. So anyways, my friend tells me to apply to CalWorks because I'm getting worried about funds and it's been hard to find accommodating work while I'm pregnant. So anyways I apply, I know I'm eligible, because the qualifications include being PREGNANT WHICH I AM!!!! And after I have my interview, the person tells me thanks for submitting all the necessary documents and that I should have no issue. Well fast forward, at first they were giving me a hard time because although I have lived in California for over a year, I have an out of state driver's license because the dmv was always closed whenever I was working and there was no way for me to get over there and I dont have a car here so I didnt see a point in transferring my license until I absolutely needed to ...so because of that I think the process took longer, but I have a lease in California and I have worked two jobs here too like I am a California resident. Anyways fast forward and they deny me. I'm like HUH?? And they said it's because I don't meet the Criteria, but I do and sent in my pregnancy verification. Now the lady at the appeals is being super rude the first time she calls me. She's basically condescending like I'm trying to fraud the system, implying that I'm a liar asking me all these questions about my pregnancy being sarcastic - I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. She says that they never received my pregnancy verification and I'm telling her I submitted it along with my baby's genetic testing which also states I'm pregnant sooooo ????? So I already know there's not use trying to reason with her even tho on my benefits portal it clearly says all my documents that were uploaded and then She says to reupload it, and I do. Then she calls me back and apologizes because SHE MISREAD MY FILE WRONG AND IT DOES IN FACT STATE THAT I AM PREGNANT. She told me she would do some digging and find out why it was denied etc. SO she calls the welfare office or whatever and told me that they tried saying I didnt upload the document until yesterday and the lady thank God advocates for me because they're trying to say I didnt upload any documents and she basically tells them f\*ck no that's not true, stating that I uploaded everything in a timely manner. After she realizes I did everything correctly, her demeanor towards me changed. But I'm just annoyed that this even happened. Like this process has now taken almost 2 months. I'm pregnant and terrified and all alone here in California like I don't need more stress of people questioning my character thinking im trying to abuse the system when I actually need help rn .. so anyways she told me they're willing to resubmit my application and approve it because it was an error on their end. Thank God but still mildly frustrating.

10dsy0a,"Food Stamps Delayed in El Paso County, CO","Someone suggested I post this here.

Location: El Paso County, Colorado, USA

Quick  Backstory: We have been on food stamps for a few years.  The army got  my (now) ex husband hooked on oxy and he had a total mental breakdown  and left our family basically homeless.  We went on assistance.

How  it works here:  You apply for benefits.  You have to prove you're a  citizen.  You give them a ton of documents.  You have to work to receive  food stamps.  About every 6 months, you have to ""recertify,"" i.e., you  have to prove your situation is the same and you still need food stamps.   I have had issues in the past when I didn't recertify on time, but  they always fixed it in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't like their  system but it was always my fault in the past when I didn't get them on  time.

When I recertified, I  noticed the website was somewhat different.  What was troubling was that  some of my information was wrong, most notably that my daughter was now  listed as a non-US citizen.  They have all her documents, they know she  is a citizen.

They also made me prove my son is still in high school.  They didn't do that with my daughters.

I  also noticed that changes I made months ago were ""under review""  (actually they are STILL under review), meaning no one has so much as  opened my file since last summer.

I  didn't get my FS by the beginning of December.  I went on a local FB  group and asked if anyone knew what was going on, they said the news did  a segment on the situation.  They said the office is ""short staffed.""   But several people said that they also recertified and still ... no  benefits.  People suggested I call or go to the office.  I called them.   I had been on hold for 2+ hours when I had to go to class.  I called  them 2 times, same result.  Finally I called them and waited three hours  (I was told I would have to wait that long), someone finally - after  three hours on hold!! - answered the phone.  I talked to them for 5  minutes.  They said they would put in a ticket.  That was about 3 weeks  ago.

Last week, they texted me  that I would have my recertification interview (yes, they do phone  interviews) to determine whether we are eligible.  Normally, it is a 10  minute conversation. This interview lasted 35 minutes and they asked me  so. many. questions.  Normally, they will give me the FS stamps within  24 hours of the interview.  I still do not have my FS, several days  later.

Oh ... lol ... and lucky I  received the text because the letter they always send to inform you of  the interview was put in my mailbox an hour after the time of the  interview.  It took 5 days to send that letter about 10 miles across  town.",midsommarsolution,1673904853.0,foodstamps

10axs9b,Am I Going To Lose My SNAP Benefits Completely?,"I'm in North Carolina. I'm disabled on SSI and I get SNAP. I recertified for SNAP in November, and they sent me a letter saying my monthly SNAP would now be $94 a month.

But as you probably know, starting in January, SSI and Social Security recipients got a large cost of living increase. Personally, mine went from $841 a month to $914 a month. So $73 more per month in SSI.

SNAP sent me another letter at the end of December saying the cost of living increase may affect my SNAP benefits, but it didn't say by how much. It said I could check using the EBTEdge app and clicking on the ""benefits tab"". But I downloaded the app and there's no tab like that in mine. I've clicked on basically every link in the app, and nowhere does it say how much I will be getting in January, or even if I'm getting anything at all. I can see my past benefit transactions, but nothing for the future. So now I'm scared that means that I've lost my benefits entirely because of the COL increase. But wouldn't they send a letter specifically saying I'm no longer eligible?

When I called to see why I was denied, I was told I had uploaded the wrong documentation for proof of self-employment, even though I had uploaded exactly what the woman in my interview told me to. They made me reapply and told me the correct thing to upload, which I did. After waiting another month, I received a denial notice AGAIN in the online portal today, stating all required documents were not uploaded. So I called them and the first person I spoke to went through every requested document and stated they were all there and that she was going to transfer me to a case worker. After being on the phone for a total of two hours I was told that, while I did get a denial notice, my application was not denied and was still processing, and that, once again, they did have all required documents. This is all the case worker I spoke to could tell me and could do nothing else for me. She stated that as soon as my case is approved, I would have a card sent to me. After this two hour call, I called back to use the self-service option to check on my case and the automatic system stated there were ""No active or pending cases"" after I entered my information.

My question here is, how can a case still be pending after receiving a denial notice and the automatic system stating there are no active or pending cases? Can new cases not be approved over the phone, because everyone I have spoken to has stated there is nothing they can do and all I can do is wait to be approved. I have been trying to get approved for benefits for 3 months now, and even though I did not send the correct thing the first time I applied, it was not my fault that the woman I spoke to did not tell me the correct thing to upload. I went through the entire process of applying and uploading documents again, it has been over 30 days, and I am told my application is still pending, even though the online portal states that I was denied.

""According to the regulations, households are eligible if they contain an individual who is employed, looking for work, or attending school or training. Federal regulations place no additional restrictions on the deduction, such as limiting it to households with no nonworking adults. Nor do households necessarily lose the deduction if a household member loses his or her job, because individuals seeking employment also qualify.

I personally do not have a cashapp or Venmo account and provided them with my banking information from December 1st from my Navy Federal account. I was told someone reviewing my case went through my transactions and saw deposits from a cashapp and Venmo, around $25 a deposit. 
Are they allowed to go through bank transactions? As far as I know they are only suppose to look at the amount in the bank account on December 1st. 
These deposits came from my moms accounts she has specifically for my children in times of need or holidays. These deposits are not consistent and not monthly.

I do not have a job and have been living off of savings for several months, though I am now starting to look for a job. But my statement shows that I received payments from two people. One is my roommate who sends me small amounts of money, sometimes several times a month, to pay me back for her half of certain things I buy for both of us to use (toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc.). The other person is a friend I loaned money to in November and paid me back last month. But I‚Äôm concerned that the caseworker will think these payments are income. Also, complicating things, the friend I leant money to gets SNAP and I‚Äôm wondering if they will see that I sent her the loan (which is on the same statement since it begins in late November) and count that as income for her and lower her benefits.

104yah9,State of Emergency Question,"Hey everyone, I need a little guidance on how to go about this situation. I am currently a senior in college in NC. I have been receiving food stamps since my sophomore year because I was participating in work study. In October, I had to do my recertification and assumed I would be approved because I was still eligible for work study- even though I was not actively participating. I was told by my caseworker that I was an ineligible student because I was not actively participating in work study. After reading through this subreddit I decided to request a hearing. After my hearing, the decision was upheld because NC State of Emergency for COVID-19 was lifted in August 2022. Was this decision correct? Or should they be abiding by the Federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (which ends January 11). I appreciate any advice or help!

Update: My case was reviewed by the chief hearing officer and he reversed the decision! He said they are going based off of the federal public health emergency and not the state‚Äôs, so I am eligible for food stamps.

I haven't worked since February 2021, don't qualify for Medicaid/medical assistance or any insurance subsidy. The marketplace screener offered me health insurance at a premium of over $400 per month. I'm trying to apply for SNAP/EBT in Georgia. While I live with the aforementioned two family members, we like and eat separate foods. My income is about $300/month due to only being able to work part-time minimally on the computer doing some stuff that doesn't pay very well (online surveys) and I maybe make $10-15 a day on most days and it takes up a lot of my day. Presently, the only bill that I pay is for my cell phone/internet bill and my mother's cell phone is also on my plan and paid for by me on a monthly basis. I have a number of medical diagnosis and I still need more testing that I'm struggling to come up with enough money for. 

Since I'm pending Disability, do I still technically put down that I am disabled on the SNAP application where it asks if ""anyone in the household is disabled""? I am via doctor paperwork and hundreds of pages of medical documentation, but per social security rules, they claimed that I am not and it's possible that we may end up going to an administrative law judge for approval for my SSDI that may take another year.

Is it possible to receive a replacement payment for CalWorks, especially if it is your only source of income right now?

So on Friday i checked the benefits portal to see when our CalWorks deposit would be made and came across a letter they issued saying that our CalWorks was in the process of being deposited to our bank account. Problem is, we never requested that they direct deposited our assistance to that bank account, as it had a negative balance and with children, need all the money we can receive. To make matter worse, when I checked our bank account, the bank closed down our account without telling us and don't know when they closed it or what happened to those assistance funds.

I've tried calling our worker and the bank, but given the holiday no one is in. Left messages, etc., and plan on calling our worker first thing tomorrow as well.

While I wait, I was just trying to ascertain whether they do offer benefit replacements for folks typically and if not, would they be able to given the fact that we never requested direct deposit, our bank account is closed and we have no other source of income right now?

&#x200B;

Thanks in Advance

But I am still receiving my daycare assistance and haven‚Äôt had a copay. I am due to renew my daycare assistance March 2023, which is also when I‚Äôm due with my 3rd child.

zzpayj,The HR department at my previous job is being absurd and unhelpful with my 631 form.,"Let me first clarify that these are not my food stamps. My dad is unemployed due to disability, which leaves me as the sole wage earner in the household. About a month ago, I left my job due to the intense suicidal thoughts I began to have due to working there, and now I need a 631 form filled out so that my dad can continue to get food stamps to feed my family.

The HR rep that I went to about the form told me that she couldn't fill out the form because my employment was terminated. She directed me to a third party company to get it taken care of.

This third party company not only has an absurd number of hoops to jump through, but also has incorrect  information on my file, and also shows record of continuous unsuccessful attempts by the Utah DWS to access my information.

Earlier today, I called the HR rep again and explained to her that the third party company was unhelpful and that I needed her assistance to get the form taken care of somehow.

She spewed some excuses about how other employees in the past hadn't had any issues with it and basically told me that she didn't care and didn't have any help to offer.

The next thing I did was call her boss and explain the same thing to him. I was more than a little frustrated and I let him know (still in a reasonably professional demeanor) that the way he is handling this is completely unacceptable and that I expect him to do the bare minimum and just sign the form to confirm that my employment there had ended.

From here the conversation degraded:

&#x200B;

ME: Look, I need this form signed to confirm that I don't work there anymore.

&#x200B;

HIM: I can't do that; you don't work here anymore.

&#x200B;

ME: I know I don't work there anymore, that's why I need you to sign this form that *says* I don't work there anymore.

&#x200B;

HIM: I'm not authorized to do that because you don't work here anymore.

&#x200B;

ME: Okay, can you help me get to someone who is authorized to sign this form?

&#x200B;

HIM: Look, I've already told you there's nothing I can do. You need to go through \[third party company\] to get the form filled out.

&#x200B;

ME: I've called them a dozen times. They have incorrect information and are unable to give me any sort of definitive answer about how they can help me with the form.

&#x200B;

It was here that he quit even trying to give relevant answers. Instead, he kept repeating the bullshit about the third party company, and after I started to get more frustrated, he began to give me flack for not putting in two weeks before quitting.

Literally any time I tried to steer the conversation back to the topic of him simply helping me get access to somebody who could sign the form, he kept saying ""You didn't even finish 2 weeks!""

I essentially snapped at this point and pretty much yelled:

&#x200B;

""You know what \[HR Rep\]? I wanted to put in 2 weeks but I can guarantee you that I'd have put a bullet between my eyes before those weeks were up! So thanks, \[HR Rep\]! I really appreciate how apathetic and unhelpful you've been, and I admire how you refuse to take any fucking responsibility! You really give a sense of professionalism to your workplace! Fuck you \[HR Rep\]! I hope you sleep well while my family starves because of the shitty job I quit!""

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure he hung up at some point during this rant but I was too angry at the time, so I don't really remember. As soon as I finished I broke down crying and had to collect myself so I could get ready for my shift (which I was conveniently an hour late to).

One of them being this food stamp fraud investigation I‚Äôm guessing. Back in June , my child‚Äôs father (who is on my food stamps because I live with him) got a new job. From what he was telling me it was still under our income limit for SNAP . Yes I should‚Äôve asked for proof of his income but if I pushed anything financially it turned into a huge issue. Fast forward to October , he spends 4 weeks on workers comp & then gets fired soon upon returning. He was constantly getting written up and leaving before completing jobs . Due to all of the violence & me having to move many times with my child , it completely slipped my mind to report the job . That is entirely my fault which I understand. He has a new job now and we‚Äôre way under the income limit snap gave us. I reported this job as now DCF is involved in our situation because of him & I am getting back on my feet and back in my right mind , but then got a notice saying they were just now informed he was hired at the previous job. I‚Äôm not even sure how much he did make there . He kept it all hidden . I‚Äôm not sure what to do now . It‚Äôs been over 2 months since he was fired from there. He refused to spend money when necessary so SNAP was the only way we were eating , but I should‚Äôve been more responsible. Do I call them and tell them what happened and see where it goes ? I know I messed up , I know I‚Äôll probably lose my benefits too & I am extremely nervous as that is the only way I can afford groceries right now . I think the offices are closed wednesdays for processing but I can call first thing tomorrow morning , I am just nervous as I know although I was a victim it was still my responsibility. Our income was pretty much always below the limit , but If he had gotten paid more than he told me a few times I genuinely had no clue. They just raised the income limit not long ago, I‚Äôm just really worried.

Do I have the date right?

znq9fi,Calfresh - Moved into nursing home,"This if for LA County

Hello,

My 78 year old mother, receiving Calfresh, moved into a nursing home mostly for physical therapy to be able to walk. The idea is to have her stay there temporarily, but there is no telling how long she will stay. If she is able to walk decently enough, she will be out of there. Meanwhile, we are wondering

1. Do we have to call and inform or are the funds cut off automatically once the system registers that she is in a nursing home?
2. If it's cut off, will the calfresh card with the existing funds stop? Logically, the funds should stop coming, but the existing funds should remain, considering they were entitled funds that couldn't be used in time (cash had to be paid for non-ebt food). Generally, when a person's income rises above Calfresh qualifications, his funds stop but his existing remain.
3. I am still buying her food from the market that the nursing staff is serving her, for the simple reason that she is picky and does not eat their food. The staff reported her eating only 30% portions when she was served for the first few days, and that something needed to be done for her nutrition. I might ask for staff to document this if need be. This is probably an exceptional situation for a social worker to answer.",playful-umpire2831,1671227841.0,foodstamps

My father got EBT a little after he turned 62 (he is 66 now). He is within the maximum income allowed, has no additional earnings or assets, and his paychecks have not changed or increased since then (he is not on SSI and has no pension). Last year after his recertification he got a notice that he was being denied the continuation of his benefits. He appealed and got them reinstated because there was no reason for them to be taken away in the first place.

This year it seemed to have happened again. He recertified about a month ago except this time instead of getting a notice they simply didn't send him food stamps to his EBT card. Sometimes they're late and my dad waited but 2 weeks in (his deposit date is the 3rd) and nothing so he checked online and his case just says closed. No warning, no explanation, nothing.

We have been calling every day, staying on hold for literal hours at a time, and can't get through to a human being. He needs those food stamps, even WITH them the inflation in NYC is so bad it's not enough to last him through the month so without them he'll legitimately starve.

My BMI is about 15; I am 5'6"" and weigh 95lbs. I am 28 years old. I know that my BMI is not quite at fatal levels yet, but it's sure getting close and has been dropping pretty rapidly as of late.

From here on out, most of this post is going to be detailing my application process with ACCESS Florida as well as giving some medical background to my situation. I'm also probably going to vent quite a bit, so feel free to skip to the end for a TLDR.

&#x200B;

**My income & ACCESS Florida application history:**

I've been denied expedited benefits by ACCESS Florida twice now at this point. I've still yet to receive any form of benefits from them. The first time I applied, I put down that I had an income. I had just started working in online transcription. Apparently, I picked the worst time in history to do so. It wasn't bad at first, but the work started to dry up very quickly. I began to see murmurs of discontent on the forums. Everybody was complaining about a lack of job availability and lower pay rates amongst the few jobs that were available. Most were attributing this phenomenon to the website's rapid improvement of their AI-generated transcription services, which are much cheaper for clients. Then I saw a lady who claimed to work in medical transcription (which is what I'd hoped to graduate myself into) posting on those very forums stating that she usually comes to this website looking for side work, but that her medical transcription work had been drying up so much recently, she was now primarily coming to our neck of the woods for a main source of income. She also claimed that this was due to AI's rapid improvement in her field.

This was when I decided I needed to find a new means of income. I can still work on there to get myself some pocket money for the week, but that is all it's good for now. I'm sure it's only going to get worse if AI is now able to accurately transcribe complex medical terminology. The human side of this industry is clinging on for dear life and has no future sustainability, in my opinion. I'm not sure what I'm going to do for future income now, but I know that I should choose carefully. I can't exactly afford to take warehouse jobs like I did in my younger days, I would burn way too many calories in a labor-intensive work environment such as that. I tried working as a picker at Walmart about a year ago, and I actually had to stop working on my third day because I was suffering from sudden bouts of tachycardia and getting very short of breath while on the job. I highly doubt this was due to any kind of mental reason such as anxiety, as my mood on the job was very optimistic and I was actually somewhat enjoying the work. I've also never had a history of panic attacks or any issues like this back when I was younger and healthier. It seems to be a health issue that pops up when my weight dips below about 100lbs. My experience at Walmart prompted me to obtain medical coverage as soon as possible in any form I can get it, something I probably should have done sooner. I've now got that medical coverage, but my first appointment with my selected PCP is not available until Jan 23rd next year.

So what happened with my ACCESS Florida application throughout this? At first, they told me I was eligible for expedited benefits. They then retracted that statement of eligibility and wound up denying my application entirely when I couldn't prove my income. Income that I foolishly reported based on speculation of how well I thought I would do this year, only to have the transcription rug pulled out from under me by robots. Okay, fine, but why deny me entirely? Assuming I can't prove any income, shouldn't that only increase my eligibility for expedited benefits?

To that end, I've now reapplied on ACCESS Florida while reporting no income, just to see if I could possibly get expedited benefits this time. I've temporarily stopped doing any transcription work, as I just want to see if ACCESS Florida will give me benefits under any circumstances. A friend of mine has been graciously helping me cover food expenses in the meantime, I wouldn't have done this if he couldn't afford to help me over the next couple of weeks. Apparently this time I'm not even eligible for expedited benefits right out of the gate! There wasn't even any time for someone to review my case, just automatically determined that I'm ineligible. I also just got over COVID, which certainly did not help. I lost another 1‚Äì2lbs throughout the ordeal, so logging back into ACCESS Florida after getting over it and seeing that I'm not eligible for expedited benefits this time was kind of the catalyst for me making this post. The only possible reason I could see for this is because I own the house that I live in, which is a homesteaded property. It is my livelihood, not a means of income. Not sure why this should make me ineligible.

&#x200B;

**Why I feel this is wrong:**

Knowing that people who have much more fat stores on their bodies to help sustain them are collecting benefits while I'm not getting a dime as I steadily disintegrate is utterly frustrating and quite frankly, sounds like a symptom of a broken system. I have an appointment with my doctor Jan 23rd next year (soonest I could get in) to help figure out why I'm losing weight, but I know I'm not eating enough calories lately as I simply can't afford it. In the meanwhile, extra calories would really help to *keep me alive*. I've lost 8lbs in the past two months, dropping from 103 to 95.

I highly doubt that most others receiving these benefits are actually at risk of dying any time soon, but I feel I certainly am. Bear in mind that *I don't think this at all invalidates their need for said benefits*, but shouldn't individuals like myself get a bit of priority? Or at least not be *rejected entirely*? Let alone the fact that I'm probably so malnourished, the longer this continues, the larger my risk for refeeding syndrome upon receiving these benefits becomes.

I also understand that BMI is highly criticized as a metric for health, but I don't think it can be denied that extreme outliers like myself (say, a BMI under 16 or over 40) have severe health risks associated with that number. Have a look at what true starvation looks like in countries like Somalia, I doubt most people there have healthy BMIs and they are literally dying of starvation.

&#x200B;

EDITED TO ADD: My main reason for putting forth this logic is due to empirical evidence that BMI is indeed an important factor in death due to starvation, such as this:

From the National Library of Medicine:

""Many empirical studies have observed the point of death of people from starvation and have concluded that once an individual reaches a BMI of 12 the probability of recovery, even if the subject is re-fed, is virtually zero""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529354/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529354/)

If that's to be believed, I would argue that the line should certainly be drawn somewhere, when BMI reaches dangerously low levels. I don't think that high BMI counts should disqualify anyone, but extremely low BMI counts should almost guarantee approval. If it almost meets the criteria for feeding intubation, why not for food assistance?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Closing notes:**

I don't plan to use these benefits for very long, I don't believe it's fair to the rest of society to mooch off of everybody else for long periods unless the beneficiary is disabled or somehow unable to resolve/improve their situation with time. That is not the case for me, I will be able to stand on my own two feet again at some point‚Äîbut I would have thought that situations like mine were the reason these benefits were put into effect in the first place, not for someone who has been living off government assistance for the past X years and has no plans to change that or better themselves anytime soon.

Anybody else have a similar experience to mine? Am I just in too much of a minority being underweight in a predominantly obese society? Am I just being biased? Am I wrong in anything I'm saying here? I can see how this post may come across as elitist or entitled, but it's just getting really sad stepping on that scale every day and watching myself disappear. I do not want this. I am not anorexic/bulimic, nor have I ever been.

Any additional advice would also be much appreciated. I've already shifted my focus of whatever foods I can afford to calorie-dense foods and eating more meals throughout the day in smaller portions as opposed to trying to stuff many calories down in one sitting and then not eating for hours. I've been trying to physically rehabilitate myself into a more strength-focused, muscle-building exercise routine. Is there anything else I can do to help remedy my situation in the meantime?

Thanks to all who took the time to read this essay of a post, and I'd be grateful to hear any insights or opinions you may have on this matter.

A TLDR for those who didn't read (I don't blame you, lol): Should extremely low BMI (under 16) in conjunction with low/zero income be an immediate qualifying factor for food assistance, namely expedited food assistance? Also, do you have any advice to help me gain or at least maintain my body weight right now while I wait to get to a doctor? At what point should I consider hospitalization?",-in-perpetuum-,1670701891.0,foodstamps

zen1cb,Request for bank statements from alameda county California,"Hi there, I am in Alameda county in California. I was enrolled in graduate school full time for the past 3 years. During that time, my family (2 adults, 3 children) received SNAP benefits. I graduated and started my first job in October and we reported the new income and our benefits ended (which was expected).

However, last week we received a letter stating that the state can match ‚Äúincome, lump sum payments, resources or interest and dividend payments of all welfare recipients‚Äù and is requesting bank statements or authorization for the state to access the information on that account for the year 2020 on a few savings accounts we have at a bank that is not our every day bank. The letter indicates we did not report these accounts on our application. I have no recollection of being asked to report accounts on our application but I guess it‚Äôs possible I forgot to report them. All we use them for is saving for long term/emergency situations and, until the money was gone, funds saved for my tuition. We don‚Äôt receive income there other than a few cents or a couple of dollars worth of interest sometimes (depending on rate and balance in account.)

All that to say, I am uncomfortable with the request and don‚Äôt understand why it is being requested. The letter is unclear. Is it suggesting the system thinks we were receiving unreported income into these accounts? Am I wrong in my understanding that California does not count savings when assessing eligibility for SNAP? We definitely held onto funds through my graduate school program in order to pay tuition but we always qualified for SNAP from an income perspective. 

I have left multiple messages for the individual who sent the letter but they have not responded yet to my request for clarity on what the letter is asking for. I feel really anxious about it or that we somehow misunderstood our eligibility and could be assessed as ineligible for benefits we were given more than 2 years ago.

I called today and they are leaving a note for our case worker to remove the unemployment, so I am glad that will be getting fixed. Anyways, so I question is:

Will they fix the mistake and adjust the $28 for the months of November and December and re-do it or will they fix the mistake and then in January we will get the correct amount in assistance? I would assume they will adjust the $28 from the previous months and even PERHAPS go back to the first application and go back to October but that's probably asking too  much, I wish there was a way to actually speak to my case worker again bc i call and they told me they don't do that anymore.

zb6qfp,benefits canceled without warning (in MI),"TLDR version - benefits disappeared without warning, representatives only say ""we're behind"" when I call them. I've been without benefits for well over a month

So I'm in MI and have been receiving food stamps for some time. I had my 6 month review, then received a letter stating that I needed to send in proofs of self-employment income. The problem is, I don't have self-employment income. I did, however, over 8 years ago. I have talked to representatives numerous times about the fact that my account still shows that I'm still self employed and have tried to remove it from the website myself, to no avail. So I went on the Mibridges website, and tried removing it again, stating again that I haven't had self employment income for YEARS. I also changed jobs at the same time so I reported that as well. I did this well within the timeframe on the notice. This was back in October.

Fast forward to November and the date that my card gets filled comes and goes and it's not being refilled. So I hop on Mibridges again and my food benefits are just completely gone. So I called the number, spoke to someone, and she told me she'd get it taken care of the next day. 

2 weeks went by and still nothing. So I called again. It's been over a month by this time, Thanksgiving had come and gone and I had nothing for November. The person I spoke to this time would not tell me anything other than they're behind. I asked why they were canceled, why I never even received a cancellation notice, how much longer it was going to be as it's already been a month and she would tell me nothing except ""we're behind and doing our best"". Food stamp applications aren't supposed to take longer than 30 days. That's after the initial application, for me this is just a renewal, I don't know why it's taking so long and they will tell me nothing. 

To add, I'm in the UP in MI in a small area and we don't have a local office anymore, haven't for years. You call downstate and talk to whoever answers the phone. So I don't have an actual caseworker. 

It's now December and I had to apply for state emergency relief for heat and electricity. I'm guessing they're gonna have a huge influx of people applying for SER because they're cutting off people's food stamps with no warning at all and have no answers when you call them. Which is just gonna make more work for them. Rinse and repeat

zadovq,EBT card cancelled without my knowledge ?,"Hello, I live in California and something weird happened in regards to my EBT card. Earlier this morning, I was able to use my card normally, but I tried to use it tonight and the terminal that I used said my card was declined. Due to this, I contacted the number on the back of my card and entered my card number. I got an automated response asking if I had reported my card lost, stolen, or destroyed and said no. The response I had gotten back said that the card is not working due to the card being canceled which is strange because I never called to cancel it.

I then proceeded to speak with a CALFRESH representative through the helpline and they said that the account is still active and has a balance, along with everything being correct on their end with no issues. They told me to contact the county office tomorrow and get another card issued to me.

Has this ever happened to anyone else ? I find it weird that a card can just be canceled randomly without notice if everything is correct and active. I'm also afraid that maybe someone has my card number and was the one to cancel it, but that doesn't really make sense to me either.

Edit: So I went down to the Human Services building and they said there's been an increase in EBT fraud so they've been cancelling EBT cards and sending out new ones without notice.

z7mefu,Texas SNAP Weird DELAYED Deposits!!!,"My deposit date is the 12th of each month, according to the last digit on my card. It's ALWAYS been the  12th. But in October, it was late, so I called to ask why. The CSR told me that it was due to be deposited on Oct 22nd. I asked why the delay and if the date was permanently changed to the 22nd. She didn't know. But it was deposited on Saturday, Oct 22nd.  


I wrote it off as a fluke, but when I went shopping for Thanksgiving on the 18th of November, my deposit still hadn't been made for the month. I had to use cash (intended for bills) and pare down my shopping list. This is very weird because Texas pays out from 1st to the 15th of the month and I can't find anything on their website, or in the news that says anything has changed.  


This morning, I checked and see I got the regular deposit on November 28th, Monday. I didn't call to ask about it yet. But what the heck is with this???? It's difficult to plan when my last two deposits have been 2-3 weeks late with no warning and NO EXPLANATION.",ladyanglesey,1669705508.0,foodstamps

My former spouse made enough to disqualify us for SNAP here, so I‚Äôm wondering if even though I don‚Äôt have access to their finances  & unable to access even the amount I make monthly, would that disqualify me from applying?
