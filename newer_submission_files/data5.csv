13q6oo8,SNAP closed/rejected after SAR (PA),"I signed up for SNAP at the beginning of the year. Everything went fine and in no time i had benefits. Fast forward a few months and the first time I had to complete a SAR request, my benefits were instantly closed.

I'm the non-custodial parent and currently paying  child support. We live in seperate houses.

When I applied over the phone, my income was adjusted for the child support I pay the custodial parent. When I spoke with the case manager I was told that was a mistake and I don't qualify. Something about I can't claim my child support if the children are part of the household. Due to shared custody, the children are always considered a part. I did notice a mistake that for some reason it showed I still lived with the ex. Even though it was corrected, it didn't make a difference. 

I don't understand this. If the custodial parents files for benefits, the income is automatically counted as income. Why is it not a deduction for the payee? There is still children to support.

Is there anything missing here that i can do? Do I have any options?",no-earth197,1684890340.0,foodstamps

13pzsm2,Unconventional living situation affect eligibility?,"I live in western NY. I recently got a letter from NYS of health stating my husband and I now qualify for Medicaid with our 16 month old son. So I thought I would look back into food stamps, especially with how insanely expensive food is right now.

So I live in the country, my mother in law owns the house. There is an apartment that used to be a garage that is on the back of the house. That's where me, my husband and son live. There is no way to enter the main house from the apartment without going outside and through the front door so it's completely separate other than we are on the same electric and other utilities. 

My mother in law and brother in law live in the main house. My husband works full time while I'm a SAHM. 
His mom and brother also both work at the same local grocery store.
We pass his mom about 550$ a month that's basically meant for our share of utilities and whatever else. 

With trying to help pay for upkeep on the house as a whole, vehicles breaking down amongst everything else, we are scraping by. My father in law passed away from cancer almost a year ago and my mother in law can't get his SS or whatever  it is until she turns 60 at the very end of 2024.

Not sure how the living situation will affect our eligibility, I don't want to get in trouble for fraud, if I can't get it, it will be what it will be but I don't want to start the process then potentially get in trouble because of the living situation. 

Not sure if I'm forgetting any context but any help would be appreciated.",art3misgr1mm,1684873833.0,foodstamps

13pd30h,Can I Work a Short-Term Job Without Losing My CalFresh and Medi-Cal (Medicaid) Coverage?,"Hey everyone,  
I wanted to share my situation and seek some advice. For nearly a year, I haven't been able to work due to various reasons. Currently, I'm living in Los Angeles and relying on Medi-Cal for my healthcare coverage and CalFresh. As I'm in the middle of completing some classes, I recently stumbled upon a short-term tutoring job.  
The job is expected to last only around two months, but it's appealing to me because it offers both valuable experience and much-needed income. However, I'm concerned about going over the income threshold set by CalFresh and Medi-Cal, which could result in losing my benefits and health insurance. It doesn't seem worth it to risk losing coverage for such a short-term gig, and buying private health insurance without benefits wouldn't make much sense either.  
I'd appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have in this situation. Is there a way for me to work this short-term job without compromising their benefits? 

Is it possible to just pause it for those months? 

I'm hoping to find a solution that allows me to pursue the job while maintaining the necessary healthcare support.

13n1tau,How would (finally!) getting back child support affect my snap/Medicaid benefits in texas?,"I started receiving snap benefits as well as Medicaid for my daughters a few months after my divorce in 2019. Since then child support has been hit or miss. Mostly miss🙄 I think he’s paid maybe $400 or so a year total since then. Last august the AG’s office told him he needed to double his payments until he’s caught up. He’s sent $200 since then so that’s not going to happen lol. But, I’ve been fantasizing (how sad this is what my fantasies have come to😂) that he’s going to start paying. Eventually he’s going to have to, surely! If he does, and he’s paying me $1000 a month since he’s supposed to double up instead of the $500 he’s ordered to pay I think that would put me over the limit. Maybe, I’m not very clear on the deductions and such. Honestly, Medicaid and snap are worth more to me and my girls than his child support. I don’t want my kids without health insurance. I don’t know that I could afford it without Medicaid. Does anyone know how the state would handle this? I’ve gone without child support so long, and I dream of the day that I can take even one day off of work a week to spend with my kids. But if we lost snap/Medicaid I still couldn’t do that even if I was getting child support.

13keu5b,Recertification approved....what happens next?,"Hi,

When I was approved for SNAP last June 2022, after I activated the Link card, whenever I would call the automated system (number on the back of the card), I would hear the following message:

Your snap balance is $\_\_\_

You are scheduled to received SNAP benefits on the 2nd of each month through May 2023.

I received a packet in the mail late April 2023 to renew benefits. 

I completed the form and mailed back. I called the manage my case number about 2 weeks later to make sure it was received. It was. The automated system asked for my case number and said I was approved.  I transferred to a case manager to be sure. Sometime later, a caser worker called me to do an interview. After the interview was completed, I asked her what should I expect next? I was told that if I called back tomorrow (the following day) the system would say approved which it does.

However, when I check my snap balance (a different phone number/system than manage my case) for May, it just tells me the balance, it no longer says the date I am scheduled to receive benefits. I thought it should say the time frame I am scheduled to receive benefits (June 2023 to May 2024) and the date every month as I stated above.

Could someone help me understand what happens next since I have been approved? Does the money just automatically reload starting in June on the same day every month as before?",lavenderfields2022,1684359263.0,foodstamps

13k7ed4,My family lost SNAP because FSSA didn't update our new address in their system (Indiana),"My family moved 11-28-22 and I reported the change to the office on 12-7-22.  I got all the information turned in on time and everything was fine for a while.  We continued receiving benefits from December through April.  However, the woman I spoke to in December told me they'd mail an Interim Contact form that would be due in April and if I didn't fill it out and return it on time I'd lose my benefits.  On April 27th I remembered that conversation and realized that I hadn't seen the form in the mail, so I signed into my FSSA Benefits Portal online and saw that they'd mailed it in March and it was already past due and my benefits would end April 30th.

I called the office and the woman I spoke to asked me to confirm my DOB, address, and phone number.  It turns out that they hadn't updated my address in December and they'd sent the form to my former address.  She put me on hold while she spoke to her supervisor then told me that they had just updated my address and told me to go to the office to fill out the form.  I asked if it would be ok considering that it was already past due and she said yes, it was their mistake.  I asked if I would need to appeal their decision to cancel my benefits to ensure that I would keep my benefits while it gets sorted out.  She said no, it would get fixed.  I filled the form out the next day (April 28th) and thought everything would be ok.

Our benefits are deposited the 11th of every month.  On May 9th I checked online and nothing had changed.  It still said my SNAP ended April 30th.  I called the office again and the woman I spoke to said they'd just ""sent it up yesterday.""  She said it shouldn't take too long to get fixed.  It is at the state level now.  I asked if I should just apply again, maybe for expedited food stamps. (I have  no income right now.)  She said no, it would be ok.  A ""higher up"" just has to approve it.  It should be soon, she said.

I called again the 15th (Monday) and spoke to the same woman.  I was told the same things.  

It's now the 17th.  Our food stamps are 6 days late.  My teenage kids are telling me to apply for emergency food stamps so we can get them sooner.  I'm really starting to panic.  We're relying on food from my dad because we have no food stamps and he really can't afford to help us.  I'm worried that this isn't going to get fixed and I'll just be sitting here waiting for no reason.  If someone higher up decided not to fix this, I wouldn't know.  There's no pending application to deny.  I'm compulsively checking online to see if anything has changed.  Is there any way to speak to someone ""higher up?"" If it's at state level, as opposed to county, is their a number to call?  Is there anything at all I can do?",amandah1981,1684342494.0,foodstamps
13jizjj,California Glitch Causing Skipped Month,"I was supposed to receive my benefits on the 7th, but when I went to buy groceries the card declined. I called and was told that there was a marking on my account to skip the month of May with no note as to why, and that my case would be sent to a supervisor for an override. I was told on this call that I should have my benefits by the 12th. The 12th came and went with no update and no money, so once the weekend was over I called again. This time I was told that my benefits had been skipped because of a glitch in the system, and that no supervisors had looked at my case yet. The representative then submitted a second request for a supervisor to override the skip and told me that it was marked as urgent and I should receive my benefits soon.

It seems like nothing is actually happening with my case. I'm pretty much completely out of food and no one in the office cares. I asked what I was supposed to do while I wait weeks past the time I was supposed to get my benefits and they just said to ask friends or family for food. Does anyone have recommendations on how to get them to actually do something about what they have already admitted is an issue on their end, not mine?

With recent ""card skimming"" thieves draining benefits, this may be an option folks want to consider if they don't travel out of state and/or make purchases online.

This option is available in states that have ""EBTEdge"", and can be done by:

1. Logging into the state's EBT portal
2. Clicking ""Protect my account""
3. Selecting the option to turn off out-of-state and/or internet transactions

13ifh9x,TX Snap Change Report and TANF App,"At the end of March I went on disability from work due to health issues. 
I have already been receiving SNAP benefits and have been grateful for what I get to help with myself and two kids - so at first I didn’t plan to ask for more. Especially since at the time I thought I’d be out maybe a week. Well a week has turned into almost two months now and looking like it’s going to keep going as I try to get answers.
I ended up filling out the change report on April 27th showing my wage loss - which is almost a 2k loss a month because STD benefits are terrible.
I also filled out the TANF cash help (on April 18th) just to see if I could get anything.
Neither application or change have been looked at - and I have read some posts that say Texas is very far behind - but at this point I’m down to nothing on my card - I have visited food banks and received what I could but my options are limited to what’s around me and what I know I can cook/my kids will eat.
So my question is - is it worth calling the food stamps number to check on my application and change or just keep waiting knowing I’ll hopefully get back pay for whatever decision they make?
I don’t want to sit on the phone for hours if it won’t help; but if I can do anything I will.

I make practically $1600 per month after taxes and pay $1300 in rent. I pay $60 for gas each week (approx. $240 per month). Tell me how it’s fair that after all that I have $60 left over per month from my own income, and yet I’m only getting $23 in EBT benefits?? When I literally spend that amount on groceries per week? Like I literally have had to take out student LOANS to afford food and rent and other expenses….

When I lived in Massachusetts, with the SAME wage AND wasn’t paying rent (lived w my dad but he wasn’t part of the household), MA EBT gave me $190 a month!

I've been thinking about returning to college but am concerned what effects this will have on my SNAP benefits. I've read that a work requirement may be applied to college students, although I've also read that this doesn't apply to part time students. Working isn't possible for me at this time, so I want to check and see what will happen to my SNAP if I go ahead and become a student who doesn't work.

I'm in Kentucky, but may move to another state for school.

13gdpvk,Undergraduate student over 22 years old and living with parents. Am I eligible for food stamps?,"I know the criteria is to pay for your own food if you live with your parents, but I don't know how that's exactly determined.

My gross income last year was 12k. I pay for college through financial aid and some loans, plus income from work.

I help with expenses as much as I can. Sometimes I do pay for groceries. I don't pay the water/gas/electricity bill, but I do pay for internet and all of our cellphone bills which is actually more than W/G/E. I know the essential utilities are what they care about. Technically speaking, I could pay for the essential utilities instead, but that's just the arrangement we made cus it was more convenient.

I have been filing my taxes separately ever since I turned 18. I also receive Medicaid.

If I have to report my parent's income as well, I don't think I would be eligible. They don't make a whole lot of money. Only my mom works, but I think combined, we would be just outside of the income threshold.

13fshgt,Lost Benefits to Skimming,"Hi, I know this is a subreddit for food stamps but I could not find any for calworks or specifically cash aid benefits so I hope this is allowed and I’m able to receive and help or clarification to my situation. Also I am in the state of California.

On May 3, I checked around midnight to make sure I received my benefits and they were there. Later that day around 2 pm I went to the ATM to withdraw the funds from my ebt card and then deposit into my bank account so I could pay my rent. The ATM said insufficient funds which I thought was strange so I entered another lower amount and it said the same thing. I checked on the provider app and to my surprise it said $840 withdrawn from a US Bank in Apple Valley six hours ago. 

I am about an hour away from Apple Valley and have no car. Then I realized my card is in my hand how the heck is this possible. From there I called the 877 number on the back and they issued another card and said to call and report the incident to the welfare office. In person I submitted the proper paperwork and three other people were there for the same thing. The guy helping me told me on May 2nd there were fifteen people who had the same problem. I also filed a police report although I was told I did not need to anymore.

They said it takes 21 days, I’m assuming and hoping that means 21 days to receive my funds again. However, my rent is due and I just do not know what to do. Has this happened to anyone else and how long did it take to receive funds? I did search this up before posting and found a lot of people have had their benefits stolen in this way. I am just unsure about the timeline or process for cash benefits.

I’m afraid my landlord will evict me, I received a three day notice on the 5th. It is well passed three days, I don’t think he cares that this happened and I don’t have it.

Thanks in advance and sorry this is all over the place, I haven’t been thinking straight since this happened.

EDIT: I know I won’t know for certain until I receive the funds back on my card. My reason for this post is to see if anyone else went through this so I could have some type of comfort.

I’ve been hit with a lot of bs during this time from the DPSS but what happened last month doesn’t make any sense and I’m wondering if this happened to anyone else. I am a grad student so I am only able to work 20 hours a week, which is the minimum required of students on ebt. My internship only pays minimum wage and as a result, I was receiving max benefits. I had to do my verification of income reporting in February and when they had reviewed it in March, they told me that my benefits were being reduced by $50 dollars due to an increase in my overall income. The increase in question is the state mandated 50 cent increase to minimum wage in California that went into effect in January. Relatively speaking, Im in the same position that I was before, along with everyone else making minimum wage. I called my case worker to see if this was factored in and they said yes. I don’t see how that is true as I hit the bare minimum qualifications to have ebt, meaning that Im in the same boat as all other part time student workers making minimum wage. Did everyone else in this position also see a $50 reduction?

13c40kk,Any advice on tracking transactions in NYS?,"I live in NY State (not NYC). I've been using the Android app ""Providers"" for a while now. It's been very helpful for keeping track of my balance.

In March, I ran out of food stamps for the first time. I was surprised so I looked at my history. It didn't show any deposits for January or February. It showed the deposit for March, just not for January or February.

I'm disabled and have a care coordinator. She tried for almost a *month* to call the local DSS office and try to find out what happened. She'd be on hold for two hours and still never even get a human being (like not even switchboard, *nothing*).

Finally, last week, I went into the office myself. I was able to access a person really quickly, there wasn't even a line, so I don't know why they just choose not to answer their phones. But anyway, the person I saw told me that according to their system, I *did* get my deposits in those two months.

She said if I wanted a printout of the transactions for those months, I would have to contact the 'team' that handles my case, and she gave me their phone number and email address. Since she was looking at the transactions on her screen, I don't know why she couldn't just print them for me right then, but okay, I guess I'll jump through more hoops to get my info.

Today was my deposit day, so I looked at Providers to see if my deposit came in. It did. However, now it's showing no deposit for March or April! Even though I definitely *did* get my stamps for those months. So now I'm not sure whether Providers is a reliable way to track this info anymore. 

I wish the state would have its own app or even a website I could log into and see my transaction history, the same way you do with a bank account. You'd think it would be in their best interest to give us an easy way to make sure there's no unauthorized use of our card, if they care so much about fraud...

Does anyone have recommendations on a reliable service I can use for this in New York State?

13bxkqv,How exactly does renewal work - GA,"About a month ago when I was suppose to get my April benefits, I logged into my gateway account and saw that my case was closed because I missed the renewal date. For clarity the mailboxes for my apartment were trashed because of vandalism so until they're replaced all my mail is held at the local post office which is 6 miles out from where I live and I don't have a car to visit there on a regular basis. 

   I have it set up where I'm suppose to get both physical AND email notices, but I never received an email and thus missed the renewal date. The notice said that I can still send in a renewal application within the 30 days of the SNAP case being closed so I did that day on the 7th, a Friday, and the letter I received after said that it'll start processing it on the 10th of Monday. The letter said that it'll take up to 30 days to process and that I should expect a phone call from my case worker for extra information and that's the last I've heard of anything since. 

   I've tried calling, but it's all machines and no one is available to pick up. I've tried going to the offices, but they're either closed for that day or no one is seeing anyone unless you have a prior appointment, which I can't get because I get nothing but machines and busy lines. It's coming up on the 30th day since I've hit submit and I still haven't received a call or been able to get in contact with a human at the offices. I'm just getting a bit anxious about this because I've had to blow through my savings to put food in the house and now we're on two months without that needed support and it's starting to get tight. So I'm just wondering if the process is normally this long? Is there a way to speed this process up? To get a hold of someone to know if my case was even looked at? Will the benefits just be there on the 10th? I understand this service is understaffed and people are trying their hardest to work with a broken system but it's really stressful to be kept in the dark like this.",jojojelatto,1683564468.0,foodstamps

139ub5v,Rejected and now receiving benefits?,"Hi all, I'm reaching out to reddit to see if anyone has had a similar situation since my counties' office is nearly impossible to reach.

For starters, I am a college student who lives with 3 other roommates. In this apartment building, we technically all own our own room, and the only thing we share is the common room. We are expected to cover all of our own expenses, and the only thing we share money for (occasionally, usually it's me having to buy everything,) is paper towels, trash bags, etc. Anyways, I applied for food stamps a few months ago due to struggling to find a job, and not having enough money to live on. The first time around I was rejected for reasons I cannot remember, but I know I didn't agree with them and tried to appeal only to never have my phone call or voicemails answered. I sent in another application a month or two later only to be rejected once again, but this time it said something similar to, ""You have been rejected for the following reasons: \[blank\]."" Nothing was written, and I was incredibly upset that I didn't bother to reapply again after that.

Now to the present: It has been maybe 2 months since I last applied and I haven't heard anything from my country regarding my food stamps. Today I received two letters saying that I've been approved for food stamps from January 2023 to 2024. I am incredibly confused since, as far as I know, I've been rejected. I called the EBT hotline since apparently I've been receiving benefits since January, but never received a card. Apparently they've been putting my benefits on my old card (I did my first degree in 2018, and was on food stamps then) and never told me. I will be receiving a card in the next few days, but honestly this entire thing is throwing me for a loop. I'm incredibly grateful I will be receiving benefits, but also really confused why my case suddenly changed. Has this happened to anyone else? Or for any workers on here, can someone explain why this might be? I'm from Minnesota.",rosielights,1683389677.0,foodstamps
139ra33,Employee error results in loss of benefits. Please help in how to get reimbursed?,"I was sent my re-application paperwork last month, filled it out sent it in early. Soon after I receive mail asking for documentation of my income (I have $0 income and writing in the amount a family member pays my landlord directly was misunderstood on the application as income towards myself). The letter had a date I needed to give this info by. So I took the only option I could and called the office. 

My partner spoke for me, besides me giving personal identifying info. He explained the situation to the woman who completely understood the mistake and said she was changing in the system to reflect that I do not receive any income. She also asked if we would like to officially put my partner on as an authorized representative to make calls like this for me, which we said yes. She assured us on the phone that this was all complete. This was 5 business days before the info was required. 

Less than a week later, on the day I receive my benefits each month nothing was deposited into my account. Of course it was a Friday evening when I was about to order groceries, so I had to wait until Monday to call to try to figure out the issue. There was no notice in the mail of my benefits ending. So I was hungry and distressed all weekend. 

My partner and I call twice Monday, only to be sent to the voicemail of a Supervisor who did not return my call.

Tuesday (5 days without benefits now) we call again and after it being mentioned that my partner is NOT authorized as a representative for me, I make the realization - **they have cancelled my benefits because the original woman be called over a week before lied about correcting my information** We make this very clear with them, and at first they claim there is no call on record from us on the 10th (when we first called, they later admitted to having the call logged and gave us the employees name). We’re then thrown around to a useless supervisor, a few more voicemails (all while we are being told that we are being sent to someone who is currently ready to take our call). 

When we finally speak to someone, the best she can offer is that my benefits would be back in ANOTHER 5 days. We repeat how they have admitted this to be an issue where one of their employees fraudulently claimed she took actions that only a Case Manager or higher could do and then I lost my benefits due to her negligence and expressed the emotional distress of trying to get the food I need, that never should have been taken from me. We asked for the name and number of this supervisor’s supervisor. 

We took a bit of time to breathe, since we had been on the phone for hours. This supervisor calls us herself in the meantime, pretty quickly she tells us she is fixing the issue and that my benefits will be back in my account by 9am the next morning and gives us her direct number to call if it isn’t. 

The next day, it’s there!! But then…I realize if I was formally receiving benefits on the 21st and now it’s the 26th, due to *their* error/negligence, what happens to the 5 days of benefits I missed due to their error? For me, that’s almost $50 and I completely depend on every cent, esp since the COVID benefits just stopped and food costs continue to rise. 

I left the supervisor direct voicemails this past Wednesday and again yesterday and have not heard back yet. Will I be able to get this reimbursed? Is there more I can or should be doing to report this whole situation?

Thanks for any help or input. This has been such a headache and I’m already in an unwell physical and mental state, just barely keeping myself surviving.

Update 5/2/23: I finally received a call back from a top supervisor in my county (she had been out of office for personal reasons). She understood my concern, and assured that my benefits will return to the 21st starting this month, so there will be no missing benefits. She explained that the date that benefits are received is based on social number, something none of the “experts” in the comments were able to mention in all their talk of policy. This was the exact answer I needed and I’m grateful that the head of my county not only showed true care and compassion for me, but truly put in the time and effort to understand my concern and correct an egregious error of an employee.",thirdeye_13,1683383231.0,foodstamps

We turned in all the paperwork and got denied our renewal. After looking around, I figure it's because I don't work the 20 hour minimum...yet.

I just got approved for a few more hours with my dad. It would put it up to literally 19.5 hours per week.

Is it worth reporting the change? Should I try to get the form I had been using for my husband since I am still taking care of him along with this job?",spikedpeachtea,1683083815.0,foodstamps

I got my request for documentation and got it all in (in person at my local HHS if that's helpful info, my mother was the person physically turning things in for me) before March ended. Got a Lone Star Card in the mail 4/07, as I've learned is customary for first-time applicants by reading a few threads here I guess? Activated the card, no active benefits, said the date I'll receive benefits is on my acceptance letter, there is no acceptance letter, cool cool. I call 211 on 4/12, explain the situation, the first person tells me I still have documentation to submit. I confirm with my mother that I don't. I call again, the second person tells me everything's squared away and submitted (i got epically trolled by the first person it seems 😞) so she'll escalate the application.

So yeah, still no change or movement whatsoever, which is unfortunate seeing as how EBT applications usually have a decision declared in about a month or so, but I did hear everything's backed up and a hot boo boo mess even for people who actively receive benefits. I extend my apologies to everyone affected.

So what should I do? What should I expect? I've been checking daily and I don't know if my actions make me a busybody since I'm not too familiar with this process.

12z05ni,Husband and I aren’t together. Case worker called my references and one said I live with my husband. Possible fraud investigation?,"I am in Tennessee. 

I had my recert today and they asked me for 2 references which I gave. 

Some backstory - my husband and I have a rocky relationship. It’s on again off again, but neither one of us can afford a divorce. I’m currently in nursing school full time so I don’t work. Right now I bounce between family and friends until nursing school is done. I do, however, continue to use my husbands address for mail.

I’m worried that I’m going to end up going to prison. I was approved but have to put in a document stating why I do not work at my former job (full time nursing school). Do I just not submit this and retry again? If this does go forward with a fraud investigation what do I do? I don’t have access to my husbands income and my reference even offered to call back and say she misspoke, but I thought that would just look sketchy. I’m worried this will make it to where I cannot go forward with school. Any advice is appreciated.",ging3rmomma,1682466419.0,foodstamps
12yq31r,Something non-food got charged on my SNAP card.,"Like the title says, something non-food was charged to my snap card. 

When we were checking out, I had this coupon for food items, and everything for the coupon at checkout. There was an error with one of them, and the checker saw I had the right item and fixed it. Note, the checker didn’t know we were using SNAP or anything. She did something, but I was surprised when a $1 hot wheels car was charged to the card. Usually when I have non-food items on the same ticket, I charge the SNAP card and then the remainder on my debit. That’s just how it’s always been. 

I’m just perplexed by what happened. I wanted to come on here and ask if I’ll get in trouble for this error. I’m just worried I’ll get in trouble for this. I’m not trying to commit fraud, especially when it comes to a $1 Hot Wheels car. So, will I get in trouble?

Thousands of Alaskans who depend on government assistance have waited months for food stamp benefits, exacerbating a long-standing hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic, inflation and the remnants of a typhoon that wiped out stockpiles of fish and fishing equipment.

The backlog, which began last August, is especially concerning in a state where communities in far-flung areas, including Alaska Native villages, are often not connected by roads. They must have food shipped in by barge or airplane, making the cost of even basic goods exorbitant. Around 13% of the state's roughly 735,000 residents received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits — or SNAP — in July, before the troubles began.

12vdm57,Family Loan assistance impact question,"  

H - I live in NYC and have a question about how cash loans from family impact eligibility. I am married with 2 children 5 and under (3 & 5). I have had no income for almost 2 years due to losing job after business went south and then inability to find work afterwards combined with some family health problems that required me to be at home for an extended time frame (but which are now concluded). I have lived off unemployment, savings and credit cards and more recently have been receiving assistance via loans from immediate family (deposited in my bank account via check) that I am expected to pay back when re-employed. Never wanted to take SNAP because always thought would be able to be reemployed quicker than occurred and on some level didn’t think I deserved it and had savings to compensate - but now that is gone except for \~5K that I will burn through in near future (and frankly is a level of cash I'd like to hold onto for an absolute emergency). Family loan assistance is maxed out and will not continue going forward but I did receive help last month. 

First, am I subject to an asset test with 2 kids under 5 but no income and thus do I have to I use up that 5K before I apply - my impression was in NY with young dependents that asset test was waived (so I could hold onto 5K for emergency - you never know with young kids)? 

Second, with regard to the family loans, do I have to report that? While I have received a significant sum on monthly basis for last 6 months (\~3K month, please I know how lucky I am to have that kind of financial help so please no hate) help cover living expenses, that is ending now and frankly I am hoping to partly replace it with SNAP until I can find employment?

On the followup phone call with the nice lady, I asked her how I report if I'm looking for a job since I saw there were work requirements and she said ""oh, you don't"". I was confused because I have to be looking for work in order to be applicable, but there's no way to report it, I asked how am I supposed to follow the guidelines and she said ""you just need to call and tell us when you accept a job offer"". I got the approved mail a little bit ago (got the card yesterday) and it's saying I have to follow the work requirements like trying to find a job and if I don't follow the requirements I can lose benefits, and I'm just kind of anxiety panicking because its not saying anywhere a place I can report the info too like an email or anything. I'm just worried because I don't want to do anything wrong but I'm not finding a place I can say ""I've applied for such and such job"" or ""I've been interviewed at this location"". I've tried calling but I've always been on hold for over an hour before the line just drops. I just want to do things correctly and I'm worrying and panicking because I don't know what or how to do.

My secind question, what's a good list for buying things with snap? Like, I keep just seeing ""take a look at your pantry and see what you don't have"" or ""here are the things you can and can't buy"", I just want a list of like ""here's what I bought that got me through my foodstamps time"" or ""this is what I recommend you buy"", I just don't want to make a mistake and I know if I just try to ""get what I don't have"" I'm afraid I'll get something that isn't going to be touched, or I'll just mess up somewhere and make a mistake, I just want a guideline to follow and stuff, ""this much meat"", ""this much rice/pasta/beans"", ""this much veggies""

Sorry if these get asked a lot, I spent the last three hours trying to look this stuff up and just got overwhelmed when it was the same ""here are the work guidelines"" or ""here's what can and can't be bought"" over and over and over.

12sbpuc,Sudden decrease in benefit amount again?,"Hello, so last month I made a post asking about why my benefits could've decreased without warning. Our base amount used to be 380 without the emergency allotment. We renewed with the Sar7, our gross income was the same (1900 a month and rent is 1875) but our benefits dropped all the way to 180 a month.

But this month we got 250 in benefits, our amount on the account still said we'd be getting 180 a month but now it's dropped down to 95 dollars a month with NO warning or updates as to why? I would think it's the emergency allotment but that's never actually be on our account as the monthly amount each monthly benefit amount.

What the hell is going on here? Nothing's changed in terms of employment, gross income, or medical expenses compared to when we applied and renewed. So why does our benefit amount keep dropping?  


Edit: Wanted to give an update for this. Never really got answer/response when on the phone about this situation and didn't have time to go in person but we got our benefits this month on the 8th and it was 250 which was the amount we got last month and the amount that was stated to be what we'd be getting.

I am currently receiving both SNAP and Medical. My mother is in the process of being screened for low-income senior housing.

She is selling her car as she can not drive anymore and asked if the check could be made out to me so that I could deposit it in my bank and give the money to her as she needs it. But the amount would be well above my income limit to qualify for SNAP and Medical.

My concern is, would this somehow flag me and disqualify me for benefits? The money would not be mine to spend, and would not be in my account for more than a few months, but I don't know how the vetting process works and if the state would be notified about it or if it would come up somehow.

I'm trying to get out of this situation and am currently not in contact with him, but he refuses to close the joint bank accounts (that are primarily his) and keeps money in there hoping i'll spend it so he can revive that power dynamic. According to my state's (CA) regulations, any cash gifts could--and in my case, probably would--disqualify me.

My ex and I have been divorced for 11 years now.  He's 55+ and has severe breathing issues and is on 3 liters of oxygen and works with a portable oxygen concentrator.  His doctor has warned me he's issues with hypoxia.  

When we got divorced, the alimony agreement was for $400.  In 2020 it changed to $500 and I pay $200 in rent.  I did not get the changes written down.  HOWEVER I have paid taxes on this amount.  And in past EBT interviews, he's signed papers and verbally told them $500.  Today he told the interviewer $400.  I also found out he's been putting $400 on his tax forms.  And when he told me he talked to the interviewer, he was very happy he remembered the $400 amount.

I have already told him that I want a letter from his doctor detailing that he's on oxygen and has issues with hypoxia.  Is there any other documentation I should gather?

I'm working on a story about delays in processing SNAP applications in non-NYC counties in New York State. Through a records request, we got data from the state that indicates that illegal delays in processing SNAP applications are widespread.

If you've applied for SNAP in New York State and it took longer than 30 days to get an approval (or denial), I'd love to talk to you. Or, if you're a case worker at a DSS office in New York State, I'd also love to talk to you.

Psychiatric impacts me mainly because I would have to take a leave of absence if I were hospitalized, but my dx is also known to have trouble with stress response and executive function, plus comorbid anxiety makes it tough to drive a car.

12gz2qn,NYC HRA - Food Stamp Recertification Application Mistake. Will it get me into crazy trouble?,"I got approved for SNAP last year but didn’t notice it immediately which happened to another person I know because that person never received a card. I never had to do an interview, nothing was communicated to me, so I thought it was just a lost cause. I received a card months later in the mail (out of nowhere) and used it once or twice but I started a job. I tried to cancel SNAP but every single time I called, the wait time was CRAZY. I really stood on the phone for 3 hours and gave up or the automation literally hung up on me occasionally around 30 mins in saying to try calling again another time. This also happened to the other person I mentioned.

There was no way to cancel it on the app so I ignored it and mistakenly assumed the card would be open but the money expires and can’t be used. Some months later, I was laid off this job and needed assistance. The SNAP card had a collected balance on it so I used it and it worked.

Now, the office is asking me to recertify the benefits and so I did but I made 2 errors?

* I said I received Unemployment Benefits which I was being honest but I messed up by not cancelling when I had a job for those said months I worked. I’ll admit my error here. I got frustrated with the constant waiting and being hung up on so I gave up because I didn't have the time and effort.
* I put that I’m disabled and they’re asking for a letter/proof. I work remote due to a health condition but I never thought about going to a doctor to get any official note for it because nobody ever asked for such a thing.

Can I explain this to a case worker or is there serious penalization for this? I'd obviously pay back what I used while I was working. I’m having serious anxiety because I had a nightmare experience trying to cancel, I don’t even know if recertifying will be any more easy. I understand that NYC agencies are backed up but I don’t want to get in trouble for my mistakes and I really need the help. I’ve been job hunting for nearly 6 months with no leads and that’s been a nightmare. The unemployment benefits didn’t cover my rent fully either.",tehpurplecod,1681081538.0,foodstamps

So, just to give a heads up I don’t feel like the customer service workers over the phone are reliable with the information they give out when seeking assistance. I give a little mention as to why ahead in the text. And that’s my main concern for how to move forward.   
    
    
   
Hey, perhaps you can assist me with a concern I’m having.  
I was scheduled for my first GROW appointment, I guess it’s to make an assessment of how my participation in the program is to move forward.  
That appointment was scheduled for over the phone at 3:30pm 03/20/2023.  
  
I awaited for the call, and it didn’t come. I got worried that maybe it was me that was supposed to call so I called the number on the letter I received with the case worker assigned to my case and it would go straight to voicemail (not even a ring).  
I continued to wait for hours and nothing came through. Eventually, I just called their customer service line to speak with someone the next day and advise them that I didn’t get a call, that I tried calling the case worker and couldn’t get anything but a voicemail and that I left a voicemail with my name and case number and a number to reach me at.    
They informed me that supposedly my appointment was rescheduled for a later date and that I would receive a letter about it in the mail With details of the rescheduled appointment.  
  
But 9 days have passed since then i haven’t received anything. I don’t feel confident in the reliability of these county workers because days before  my appointment I received calls reminding me of the upcoming   appointment but they got either the incorrect date (the day before the letter states) or the time wrong. I’m not sure what to do next about it, if anything at all but I’m concerned that I could have my benefits revoked for not having that meeting now or doing nothing about it based on the misinformation the customer service worker gave me. I asked her over the phone to what date it was rescheduled to and all she told me that the information would be stated in the letter I was to receive.",powerofneptune,1680981963.0,foodstamps

My family of 3 (mom, dad, child under 6) qualified for Calfresh and Medi-Cal after my husband lost his job, which was our sole income. We live in CA in an extremely high cost of living area. 

I started looking for work as soon as he lost his job. I'm close to accepting a job with a top research institution that would have pretty horrible pay, but strategically could be a good career move in the long run. If I'm grossing $3,582.40 to $3,960 a month would my family of three (husband, child, and myself) lose benefits? I think I read that there is a shelter/utilities deduction. After utilities we pay about $2,200 a month in rent. Believe it or not this is about market rate rent where I live for the size of our rental unit. I anticipate take home pay will be about 30% less after healthcare and taxes.

12cab0r,Indiana food stamps question,"I applied for food stamps after canceling it last year. When applying, they usually were happy with my 1040 form but this year they want  me to fill out an itemized list of all expenses and income for the last 13 months. In doing so, I'm seeing that I earned a few bucks over the maximum allowable income for a few months that I was on food stamps. If they look at my expenses, they'll see I wasn't ending up with quite so much. Could I be forced to repay for those months I went over? Will they consider the expenses I have since it's requested on  the form?

Aside from a contract gig where I make most of my money, I do ebay. The way to make money on ebay is to go out and buy stuff to post. Looking at the expenses, I'm fine. I'm just wondering if FSSA would only look at income in my new application in regards to the months where i last had food stamps.",concentricgroove,1680674400.0,foodstamps
12c9kd5,"(Texas) Single without kids, on unemployment, advice on applying for FS","Hi, thanks for your time.
So I recently lost my job and was trying to apply for food stamps either tomorrow or the day after and had some questions. 

When I took a week off of work to visit a dying family member, work had replaced me so now I am unemployed... thankfully TWC approved my unemployment, but let's be real, it isn't enough to cover food, rent, etc so here I am.

My main concern on why I think I might be denied is because I have about $11,000 in the bank. That money was given to me by the insurance company because I got in a wreck and totaled my car a few months ago. The money is reserved for purchasing a new car.... other than that 11k I have no other assets I can think of.  
Is this money in the bank going to be a problem, and will me showing paperwork that this is from the insurance company help at all? 

I am single and 31, with no kids. 
Not sure if this is all the info you fine folks need, but please let me know any advice you can give. 

(i believe I am only eligible for 3 months of FS per 3 years... which will help me out greatly!)

129u5na,NC Clients: Income Base Period Changed,"I wanted to post about this in case it might save just one person some trouble. 

This change occurred a few months ago, but we have seen many clients provide the wrong paystubs for income verification for their recert. For over 5 years, the rule has been to provide all income for the month prior to recert. For example, recert due in April then you would turn in all income received in March. No reason to expect it to change.

Now, we are required to use all income received for the 30 days prior to the agency receiving your recert. The state did update the first page of the recert papers to say this, but the print is so small and at the bottom that many miss it. I know I would if I had been  turning in the prior month for years and years without issue. To make it somewhat more confusing, the 30 day time frame does not include the date turned in either. This new base period also applies to changes as well as applications. 

However, income base periods for odd jobs, self employment, and child support have not changed. Odd jobs and self employment are still for the prior 12 months or previous year tax return. Child support received is still the three months prior to the month the recert was due. There are more rules and situations where this could vary, but I'm not going to get into them since it's not the purpose of this post.

Some examples using the new base period:

 --App received by the agency on 4/3. We would need all income received from 3/4 to 4/2. 

--Recert received by the agency on 4/30. We would need all income received from 3/31 to 4/29.

--New job reported 5/9 to worker after you've crossed the income reporijng threshold for your household in April. We would need all income received from 4/9 to 5/8. 

Knowing this can make the difference in how quickly your recert is processed. If we have the correct paystubs and need nothing else then it can be processed asap. If we can't use half of the paystubs provided, then we have to request the ones that are missing.",panbi94,1680461225.0,foodstamps

I re-applied a few days after my denial because I began doing work-study. I uploaded a copy of my first pay stub and did another interview. I called the HRA infoline to see if my eligibility would change with the new document. But they informed me that my second application was already denied because I have an active case.

In 2022 - they never issued me a 1099-K so I didn’t report it. 

Now this year, my benefits expired in February and I did NOT recertify or renew, as I don’t need them. My understanding is, everything resets at the start of the new year. So since I didn’t recertify, and didn’t get a 1099-K in 2022 - I didn’t need to report for those 2 months.

124y2g8,[CalFresh] Question about emergency allotment,"Hi, I have a relative who is on CalFresh who signed up for CalFresh in January and has a question about how the emergency allotment worked.  When they were approved in  January it said their monthly amount was $200 and they would receive it at the beginning of each month.  In late March they got a $95 credit which is supposedly from the Emergency Allotment.  But apparently the Emergency Allotment program is ending.  Does this mean that starting in April they will only get $105 a month, or will they continue to get $200/month?  


Basically, while the emergency allotment program was running, were people getting 2 balance credits per month: their approved amount at start of month + a separate credit of $95 on top at the end of the month?  Or was it a single monthly credit that included the $95, and now that the program is ending that single credit will go down by $95?",entlassen,1680028813.0,foodstamps

124uwok,NY - Received a letter from an investigator asking for the same docs I already submitted for recertification. Why?,"**Background**:

Last year during recert, caseworker alleged that I had a business. The caseworker saw that a defunct/nonexisting business may have existed at my address but wasn't associated with me. A whole range of aggravation ensued as I was asked to prove a negative (that I don't have any affiliation with this business). You can read about it here if interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/yd8ga9/ny\_denied\_benefits\_at\_rectification\_because\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/yd8ga9/ny_denied_benefits_at_rectification_because_it/)

Scheduled a fair hearing last year and a few days before the hearing, the supervisor who would have represented the office approved my recert application and sent a letter stating that the worker made a ""mistake."" I cancelled the fair hearing as I was satisfied with the outcome.

&#x200B;

**Current**:

I got the same worker for my current recert. So I was already on edge thinking that the caseworker might be out for vengeance. I called a number of times and spoke to her once because I never received an telephone interview. When I spoke to her, she said interview not required and that I would get a letter in the mail. Follow up phone call a few weeks later since I didn't receive anything in the mail regarding needed documents, once I identified myself, she hung up on me with an exasperated sigh. Granted, I'm aware that caseworkers are swamped. So I sent in all documents I reasoned she would possibly need to make a determination. I called the main office a week later to verify that all docs were received and they were and entered in my case file.

A few days later, **my recert case was approved**.

&#x200B;

Then a few days later I get a letter from an investigator in the verification unit asking for the same set of documents already submitted. The letter was dated a day before my recert case was approved. So I call the investigator and he says to just send him everything I sent my caseworker. So I did.

&#x200B;

**Questions**:

* Is it the caseworker who flagged my case for an investigator? (Possibly out of spite for being rebuked by the supervisor and being proven wrong about  false assertions about me). If not the caseworker, then who or what flagged my case for investigation?

&#x200B;

* Since I have nothing to hide, I sent the investigator everything he asked for and some extra to further back up my documents since the letter said I had until April 2nd. Will this come back to bite me and cause more unnecessary frustration?

&#x200B;

* How will I know when the investigation is over? When will it end or be closed?

Payments should have stopped at 3 years for CalFresh with the county dismissing the rest by law, however that didn't happen and I had to file another appeal for the judge to rule that. The judge DID rule that, last April.

I received a letter from the State of California with the hearing decision that Alameda County would dismiss the rest of the amount and stop collections.

121ubrc,SIL possibly roping me into fraud?,"Facts are as follows: 
- SIL is currently 9 months pregnant and has been on food stamps and cash assistance since month 1 of pregnancy. 
- Her pregnancy is considered a high risk pregnancy and has worked in the past but goes on/off cash assistance and food stamps when her auto immune disease flares up and makes her unable to work. I am not 100% sure how it works but this is my general understanding of the situation. 
- SIL has a history of low motivation to work consistently prior to the auto immune diagnosis. I don’t want to comment on the “truthfulness” of her disease because I don’t love it but take that info for what it’s worth. 
- SIL’s boyfriend, the father of the baby, is not an official resident of the state they live in together but lives here full time. I live about 10 minutes away from them in the same state. 
- SIL’s boyfriend does not have a job currently but is physically/mentally capable of working. Doesn’t seem to have a plan right now for getting a job post baby either.
- SIL is planning on continuing her  state benefits after the birth of the baby, not sure of her timeline or even the possibility of her going back to work post baby. 
- SIL claims that in order to keep her checks coming post-birth, the boyfriend needs to pay child support through the state. 
- The boyfriends mother does NOT know her son is not working and SIL/boyfriend would like to hide these child support payments from her. 
- In order for the boyfriend to pay child support through the state (so they can keep state assistance) without using his legal address (so boyfriends mother does not find out via mail from the state), SIL tells me she needs to use my home address for the boyfriend. I own my home with my fiancé. 

Questions for the sub -
1) is this how this normally works? I have very little knowledge of how the state assistance system works. I am not getting warm and fuzzy vibes from the possibility of my SIL using my home address even though her boyfriend does not live with me. 

2) any advice on how to approach this situation? If this is not how things normally work what can I suggest to them instead (other than the obvious, boyfriend gets a job.)",lilseabass13,1679768300.0,foodstamps

My question is, how would I go proving my housing costs (I currently get snap so I’d have to update my housing cost since it would no longer be rent) in both scenarios especially with the first one since I wouldn’t be on the loan. And in both cases theyd want to know if my dad lives with us which he wouldn’t. My husband would be the one paying the mortgage my dad would just be the co-signer so we can buy a house and finally get out of these trashy apts.",biddyandalex,1679707733.0,foodstamps

After the recertification happened they increased our benefits which was confusing to me but I was assuming it’s because we’re a household of 3 now we currently get the max of 700 for 3 people. But since being in this group I’m seeing things that are worrying me such as maybe the case worker didn’t see us update his work on the recertification?

11vhzmk,Almost 90 days later and still no answer for application,"So this is my first time ever posting on reddit so sorry if I flub up. In December, my family applied for snap. I was 9 months pregnant and was told that I probably wasn't going to be able to go back to working due to a medical condition that I am working on getting diagnosed. I have applied and appealed for social security while going through testing but that is a whole other mess.

So we had our interview on December 27th, and I had our 4th child on the 28th. They made me refill out an application to add my youngest and I sent in all the paperwork within the 10 days and we waited and waited. Finally around the 30 day mark, I called (this is now end of January) and was told they were still processing applications from October. We were still doing okay with one income but then in February I got hit with a massive electric bill that I just couldn't afford. I was told we don't qualify for emergency benefits but we are now going on 90 days since I applied and I keep getting told they are working on them. Last I knew they were processing November's applications and that was 2 weeks ago. I know we qualify. We make over $10,000 under the ""cap"". And until I can get social security or be cleared to go back to working, we need the help.

All the websites I read say they have 30 days to respond to an application. We also applied for heap at that time and that has never been processed either. I keep going to pantries and food closets but I am now reaching my limit as we wait for taxes and watch as I have to choose what bills we pay and what we don't pay so we have money for food. We are in NY, is there anything more I can do? I call almost weekly and with no updates, I feel defeated.

I’m not trying to be a recipient I work and my husband works but it’s not enough for our family. We have had food stamps for a year and a half. Every 4 months they start a renewal process my last one was October 2022. They initiated another one February 2023. 

It says to click the renewal tab or call the 1800 number. The number is always busy and sends me through an automated system to just finally end up disconnected. The local office Cobb County, their lines always busy. And there is never a renewal tab or link on Gateway. I end up every time having to submit a new application for assistance. It takes a month from that date to even get it looked at. 

This last time I’ve had to write to the senate office and call the case supervisor because the voice mail boxes of the workers are full on the letterheads. I waited over a month and it just got looked at.

This page a lot more substantive info: [https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/stolen-benefits](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/stolen-benefits) 

***TLDR: all states have submitted plans for stolen benefit replacement, and this page (*** [***https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals***](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals) ***) will be updated as state plans are approved with implementation dates.***

Some key points:

* **February 2023:** By law, state agencies were required to submit their state plan \[for replacing stolen benefits\] to FNS by Feb. 27, 2023.
* **March 2023 and forward:** FNS is reviewing and approving state plans for implementation. We have [compiled a list](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals) of approved state plans and estimated implementation dates. State plans will remain in effect until new FNS regulations on benefit replacements, issued under this new authority, take effect.

**Tips for SNAP Participants:**

* **Avoid simple PINs**. Number combinations such as 1111, 1234 or 9876 may be easy for others to guess.
* **Keep your PIN and card number secret**. Do not share your PIN or card number with anyone outside your household. Cover the keypad when you enter your PIN on a machine.
* **Beware of phishing**. State agencies and EBT processors will never call or text to ask for your PIN or card number.
* **Change your PIN often**. Change your PIN at least once a month, right before your benefit issuance date.
* **Check your EBT account regularly for unauthorized charges**. If you see any, change your PIN right away to stop the thief from making new purchases. Report suspicious activity to your [local SNAP office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).
* **Contact your local SNAP office**. If you think you are the victim of card skimming and your SNAP benefits were stolen, contact your [local SNAP office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).",daguar,1678899682.0,foodstamps

When I called my case manager, she was extremely rude and impatient.

I was hoping to disenroll from calfresh because keeping track of my IRT and having to report it's constant changes would be more of a hassle than just receiving 23$ monthly. My IRT is also quite close to how much I am making so taking an extra shift here and there would already push me above it. But my income is still far below the Medi-cal eligibility limits even with those extra shifts. If cancelling calfresh does also cancel my medi-cal, would I simply have to report income changes above my IRT and wait for them to boot me off?

I applied for CalFresh (San Diego county) on the last week of February not knowing about this whole Emergency Allotment thing that's going away in March/April.

I was laid off and I’m looking for a new job. I applied for food stamps and was approved for 3 months ($251 month), but I also had to go see a case worker at the careersource  center.  For those who are under 50, not disabled with no children, you are required to do 80 hours a month of tasks of their choosing.

1. You see case worker every 2 weeks in person. You have to apply for 39 (yes 39) jobs every 2 weeks, you have to print out proof for each job you applied to (yes 39 separate pages, as well as write it all out on a form) and bring it to your meeting. If you don’t have a computer or internet you can go to the center and do it there.

2. You have to complete 20 hours of online education every week. You can choose from several topics - accounting, IT, healthcare, childcare, legal, etc. Again, if no computer you’ll have to go to the center to do it 

3. You have to attend in person workshops monthly. I believe it’s mandatory to do at least 2. Job prep,  interview prep, resume help. Each workshop is at least an hour plus commute.

I understand the goal is to get a job. A lot of these things are helpful. But it’s a lot to do for $250 a month. Which barely helps. When you add up the 80 hours of online classes, the workshops, the 2x a month caseworker meetings…. It’s kind of ridiculous.

My brother is doing some classes and living with a relative (rent $475) and working an under the table job (so cash). It's common where he lives I think, dilapidated area. It's the only job he could get for the time being. It's paying him between $900-$1100 a month. Better than nothing at all, he'd probably be homeless without it. Our family is real shitty. I don't live anywhere near him and don't have money either so can't help him financially. He lives in PA and I live in Ohio. He has about $1100 total cash saved.

His public assistance was setup by a Church based services group last year. He didn't do it himself. They did the paperwork for him but they're gone (ended their assistance program I guess) now so they can't help him again with it.

When renewing his application for SNAP/Medicaid how does he report the cash income? A letter signed by the guy paying him? I'm not even sure the guy paying him will be willing to do that to be honest. The SNAP/Medicaid helps him a lot, without it he would barely have any money after paying rent and his other bills.

That was false. We got married at the end of 2018 and shortly after I removed myself from the marriage because we had problems. I went to stay with my mom for almost 2 weeks. He told me to come back to the home and he will go to his parents who live on the same property not even 20 ft from the home we have. We had an agreement that he would pay the mortgage and light bill as a “child support payment” in the beginning of 2019. Both homes had the same address, 1 mailbox for both. In 2020 I finally got a unit number for the home and my own mailbox; at this time it had already been 1 year and half at his mothers home. Anything the kids needed he would get he wasn’t supporting me any kind of way other than paying the rent and foodstamps new this and verified. In late 2020 he filed for a divorce and updated his mailing address to my unit because he wanted the papers to go to my mailbox. We co parented very well. Mid 2021 we had started talking back up again because during the divorce process he wasn’t sure if that was what he really wanted. We were both talking to other people at this time. I became pregnant and I didn’t know who the father was. So he waited until the baby was born and did a dna test and it was his so in 2022 we reconciled our relationship and I added him on my case that he was living in the home. He was paying rent to his mother for light. The investigator called me today and stated since he used my address that’s why their asking for back pay. But when I told foodstamps my living situation and our agreement they didn’t say anything about just confirmed it. The investigator said she can’t remove it since we both had the same address. In foodstamps they told me only if he is living in the home I can’t receive food stamps, he wasn’t nor was he supporting my needs during this time. I have documentation and proof that he wasn’t in the home and she said I’m going to tell you this now when the fair hearing officer looks over all the information and sees he used this address they will side with the agency and you will lose the case since it was the same address used.

11mmge0,SNAP lowered again even though living expenses increased [ND],"I have contacted the local office via email but in the past they've explained nothing to me even in person so I have low expectations if they do get around to getting back to me.

I get the max SSI benefit for my state. Pandemic benefits ended years ago in ND. I was getting about 170 $ in SNAP monthly IIRC before the COLA increase and they lowered my SNAP to about 70 $. I was puzzled about it being more than halved but let it go since everyone I spoke to only said it was due to the COLA.

I moved in Feb. My rent costs went up. My other expenses are the same but reported as usual. I reported all changes. I have gotten another letter that my new benefit amount will only be 29$ instead. Surely this isn't correct? How am I getting less in SNAP when my expenses increased? Is there something I'm not factoring in correctly?

&#x200B;

Edit: Well I went to the office in person and was told they are not qualified to explain any of how my SNAP is calculated which is puzzling, since it is the office that deals with SNAP inquiries..but I digress. I still await an email explanation on why this occurred. Social worker and the office employees I have spoken to are similarly confused. Until then I guess I just get 30 $ and I'll probably not end up renewing the SNAP because the stress of dealing with them has not been worth the amount..

11mbei8,Not sure if I reported wrong,"Hello all. This is for CalFresh (California Food Stamps) and I reported the changes online on BenefitsCal. However, when I reported, they asked for when the effective date was, and because of the info they gave on what effective date is (when you start a job), that's the date I put in for it. 

However, I only received the income like at the very end of that month, rather than the start of it. Which means, if I put in the date of the effective date being the start of it (February), it's already been way over 10 days. But the date I actually received it was the very last day of February, which has only been about 8 days since and I decided to report before the 10 days. Should the effective date I put in be the date I received the income?

Was wondering if there would be a problem. I would try calling, but again, the lines are always so busy and a hassle to deal with. I'm unable to edit the change that I've submitted.",questionguy12345z,1678317019.0,foodstamps

11l2c5r,"Didn't get our benefits refreshed after turning in the SAR7, AGAIN? (CA)","Okay so this happened last time we had benefits, I'm in California and the first time we did the SAR7 they claimed they didn't get it even thought I turned it in and sent them the email and screenshots of the website saying I did so.  
They admitted they didn't see it and asked me to fill it out again, did a huge run around with about five to eight different people giving us conflicting information on what and how to fill out everything to get the proper information they needed. Actually got into a screaming match over three different people in a row after a two hour hold time telling us different information, we could not get a straight answer. This went on for the whole month, some days we'd be on hold for two hours only to have them hang up on us or transfer us to a closed department. We even went IN PERSON and they still turned us away. So we ran out of time and reapplied.

Applying went just fine, got benefits on a new card with a new pin no problem. I was late to turning in February's SAR7 because I've been having MASSIVE technology issues. But I did turn it in on the 21st with all of the correct information that I was told to have unlike last time where I was missing a few things. I even went overboard and provided a written letter with resources showing my self employed income. 

I got a text a few days later I needed to upload documents showing that my disabled living had changed...? Which it *hasn't,* I didn't even select that it had on the website forms? So I sent a text back saying that I had nothing that I could upload as there have been 0 changes to medical/disabled living. I hear nothing back and our account still shows that it's active.   
I got a letter with no post date on it at all so I have no idea when it was sent saying they hadn't gotten our SAR7 by the 11th so our benefits would be discontinued. Our account still shows that it's active so I assumed it was sent before I had turned in my stuff.

Well we're supposed to be refreshed today, we've been starving for a few days cuz the only food bank near us is like three miles away and we don't have a car or a money for Lyft and walking is out due to me being disabled and my partner being injured, plus the only food bank near us actually requires a five dollar donation that we also don't have. So needless to say we've been excited to be able to eat again.

Nothing.   
I'm trying not to be frustrated but this is EXACTLY what happened last time but I made triple sure I had bank statements, proof of my payout days, separate highlight colors for one time gifts and my income, my written statement, screenshots of my self employed page, everything. I know I turned it in late but I read I had until the end of the month to do it and if I waited beyond that, then they would be stopped.

My first SNAP renewal was automatic. I got the letter in the mail stating that it would be from 12/1/22 to 5/31/23. I started my new job on 12/5/22.

Can I use whats on my card since no one's changed my case? Or should I just hold off from using it? My recertification date is set to be in april.

When I check the BenefitsCal website, it says I have $70 in the account, but under ""benefit amount"" it says ""$281 monthly"". Does this mean I will be getting the $70 every month or at some point will also get $281? I'm just happy to get anything honestly, I just want to know what to expect. Thanks in advance for the help!

11gcs2r,Access HRA app and trouble uploading documents,"I'm applying in New York and having trouble getting the Access HRA app to recognize my documentation, and was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and knows what to do.

The primary issue is all of my documents are in PDF form, but the Access HRA app only allows you to ""Take a Photo"" or ""Select a Photo."" PDFs appear to not be recognized.

Initially I assumed this just meant I needed to convert the PDFs to jpgs, which are recognized by the Access HRA app. Access HRA is able to see the .jpgs in my phone's camera folder, in my screenshot folder.... virtually, all jpgs.

But when I converted my PDFs to jpgs and saved them to those same folders, the Access HRA app still can't find them. I tried PNG files too, just to see if that changed it, but there's still no luck.

I'm 100% certain the newly made and converted files are in the correct folders. I've even tried things like moving them to the screenshots folder, where I can see the Access HRA app allows me to select from, but the app for some reason just doesn't recognize the documentation. Frustratingly, it does recognize new photos, new screenshots.

I've reset my phone several times and logged in and out of the app even more times, but this hasn't helped.

Does anyone know what might be going on?

Also, the last time I applied to get my medical coverage off my moms case and onto my own (application for own insurance I mean) I was told they're unlikely to do that as its easier to keep it on her case and that way I wouldn't have to use a different address, does anyone know if those policies have changed? 

Either way it won't matter to me because it's better for me both ways but I also realize it is actually better if my medical case stays under my mom, both for the keeping of the address benefit and also so I wouldn't have to do the medical application all over, I have a good feeling this would be the case, but since I did tell them I was under abusive circumstances (over 18 her, 25 to be exact) I wonder if they used this info in their decision to possibly take me off everything, which again can only be a benefit for me since it'd be better to have everything under my  case for the future, I am about to call right now and find out anyways.

 The only underlying factor I would mention about wanting the case to be completely under me would be so I don't have any hardship in the future if my mother tries to claim I'm mentally ill and cannot be taken off unless her authorization allows it (I doubt they would approve that without proof from me ) and I wouldn't doubt my mother from taking those steps in the future even if she hasn't so far, she is the type to threaten herself with injury so the cops will believe her over me or anyone else in the household anyway, she's done it before so I'd rather not let history repeat itself in that regard with something she could control like that, I don't have my own place currently that's why I'm applying for assistance to get the ball rolling and because I really need food right now.",associatebubbly7981,1677715975.0,foodstamps

Also, I'd have to report every time my income for the month goes over the IRT right? So what if I report it within a few days of it going over the IRT. I'd still have to continue to report it towards the end of the month too as it goes up right?

Hasn't been paying rent due to man being nice and also helping him with stuff (he's done a lot for him). No job, has been dealing with a lot of health issues (hospitalized a bunch of times but is much better now). Has SNAP and Medicaid. SNAP is maxed out I believe like $281 a month. Food money obviously helps a lot. Medication is $1 a month rather than $45 a month. Originally he didn't use the SNAP for like 9 months or something because his Uncle's gave him a ton of frozen and canned food. Surprised they never canceled it. 

Old man is very sick now (physically and mentally-dementia) and he can't live there anymore. Old man is getting really crazy. Has to find a new place asap. Like as soon as humanly possible. Room is filling with sewage daily when water is run too long. He's going to get sick. Main line is broken or something. Old man doesn't care and cousin can't fix it. And he's getting really crazy and accusatory (accusing him of crazy stuff he didn't do) and threatening him. He could end up sleeping in his car. 

Cousin has a friend who lives in a nice, small, but cheap apartment not too far away. Only $700 utilities included. They have one unit left. They're going to let him in it soon seems like because of his personal connection. He also found a stopgap job for some income. Guy is going to let him tag along and help cut grass with him starting in March and pay him cash. Sounds like he'll make around $1200 a month doing that. Not a lot of hours, 20 something a week.

I'm in Washington State. I recently found out that you could order groceries on Instacart and pay with EBT.

If you guys don't know, any person receiving any type of public assistance is exempt from the bag fees and taxes.

When I called to speak to them, they said they do not offer refunds and that I needed to look at the fine print for this. Hung up the call, then went to create an order to see the fine print.

I called them back to ask again. The next person I got continued to tell me the same thing, however, after checking on the [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov) website this is what it says under exceptions:

* The fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Food Assistance Program (FAP).

11awtl5,MI SNAP (& Medicaid) case worker denying self-employment cost of goods sold expenses that weren't purchased recently.,"Accounting 101: When a business (or person operating as a sole proprietorship) purchases inventory for the purpose of resale, it's not an expense.  The business is exchanging one asset (i.e. cash) for another asset (inventory.)  The cost of the inventory is only an expense once it is sold.

Until about 3 years ago, I had self-employment income from reselling products online and submitted monthly Michigan DHS-431 statements with copies of receipts for all expenses, including for the actual inventory sold during that period.

After about 3 years without self-employment income, I started selling online again.  I timely filed my notice of change of income and started submitting monthly DHS-431 statements before even hearing back from my caseworker.  They just sent me a notice saying my ""old"" merchandise expenses can't be used as verification for current expenses.

Obviously, I can't submit old non-inventory expenses, but inventory is just different.  Maybe she doesn't understand the invoices provided are for the actual inventory I just sold, but I'm pretty sure she's now thinking I can only deduct inventory expenses if it's purchased in the period the DHS-431 covers, or at least is fairly recent.  That's just not how it works.  The same caseworker years ago accepted inventory receipts that were years old without a problem.  :-(  I understand they're not trained accountants.

I'm writing a letter back, and I'm struggling to justify my position with a slam-dunk that will hopefully avoid yet another administrative appeal.  Michigan BEM 502 is for self-employed income, and pg 3 says ""Countable income from self-employment equals the total proceeds minus allowable expenses of producing the income... Allowable expenses include all of the following: Identifiable expenses of labor, stock, raw, material, seed, fertilizer, etc...""  I can argue that especially because I sell many types of products and few quantities of each, that I can easily identify the expense of my stock with an invoice, even though it's years old.  Many of the invoices are for the only time I've purchased that specific item.  But, the BEM doesn't go into further details for timing of expenses for COGS.

BEM 502 refers to 7 CFR 273.9(c)(9).  (Well, it refers to 7 CFR 273.9.1 in a typo because that doesn't exist.)  This CFR refers to 7 CFR 273.11(b)(1) which has the language BEM 502 copied pretty much word for word.  But, neither of these CFR's or any related ones spell out the timing of expenses for COGS.  I searched Michigan and federal caselaw, and found no on-topic cases about these regulations.

Is there anything else I can include, like authoritative sources, to try to avoid having to go through an administrative appeal?  I mean, I can include source authoritative for accounting and taxation about the timing of deducting inventory, but I'm hoping for something more on point.

Note BEM 502 does allow a new business (or perhaps one with a substantial change in business income) to file an estimated Schedule C, even if not actually filed, but that's listed as a Medicaid verification source only -- not food stamps.  I know I'll have to give an estimated Schedule C for Medicaid since the DHS-431 isn't usable for that, but I'm just pointing out submitting an estimated Schedule C doesn't fix my food stamp issue.",select-weekend-1549,1677259572.0,foodstamps

118jwvv,Alabama EBT notice about expiring funds on closed case,"I closed my food stamps case in Alabama around mid-February of 2022 after getting a job that made me ineligible for benefits. I reported the income increase then a few months later in May of 2022, I moved to Mississippi and also reported the address change. I did not need to apply to MS food stamps program, and I stopped using my card since I figured the balance on there wasn't right for me to use. I believe I had an emergency need for the funds, and with a balance still, I used probably less than $200 of it around June sometime. I knew I'd be able to pay back $200 if it came down to them saying it wasn't mine to spend, but I didn't use it again after that. 

Now it's been 8 months since I've used the card, but I just received a letter (to my new Mississippi address) from Alabama food assistance offices letting me know I have benefits that they, quote ""encourage me to use"" before they expire in 30 days. I checked my balance to find $1100 on there. I know I hadn't been using it all monthly even prior to the income increase since I lived alone.

117hkv1,EBT Investigation help,"Looking for some advice/insights on an EBT investigation that was just started for my previous year’s eligibility. 

I was receiving SNAP for my two sons and I, their father was reporting the same address but was not staying in the house with us due to domestic issues so I didn’t report him as part of household because well he wasn’t here and wasn’t supportive financially.

Fast forward to this January he lost his job and we agreed he could stay here again to help with the kids while I went to work full time again. I reported this on my case and added him to the household. 

 Now an investigator is asking to have signed statements from everyone about where he was staying etc to prove my eligibility. 

What happens if I cannot get others to cooperate/sign the statement?? It is a complicated/toxic situation. Will this turn into a fraud charge? Will they just redetermine eligibility period and make me repay overpayments?",national-matter7212,1676920211.0,foodstamps
117gkqu,Need advice for Alabama Foodstamp application,"Hello all! Just discovered this subreddit, and so glad it’s here, as i now don’t feel as alone.

So without getting too much into things I’ll try to make it somewhat concise (please don’t be mean to me because I’m from Alabama I promise I’m different than ignorant people and please don’t be mean in general, for I am  hormonal :) )

I am a pregnant stay at home mom, living by myself.
I don’t have income right now, and rely on help here and there from people, little bit of money I had, etc. The father of both my children has been paying for the water and power for us to live in his family home instead of child support.

My question is: 1.) It asks me if anyone pays part, or all of the bills. Should I put his name? And if I do, what does that mean: do they count that as income for me? 2.) would it be better to have him send me money for child support instead of the bills diapers thing? Do they count child support as income? 

I have more questions, but I’ll start there. Like a lot of others I see, I have to reapply basically now for March. They didn’t send me anything, but it says reapply online. I t gives me so much anxiety because I desperately need the help, more than ever. I think most people do, which is what’s so crazy about the timing of all this.


To much info to follow, just need to share. Maybe someone will relate?
I also just want to say: I want to get back to work. I am tired of having nothing. I feel stuck because I don’t have family to watch him, I don’t have a car, he was unexpected, and then now his brother is and I was on Birth control and took it regularly. I thought about taking abort pill , but it is illegal here and I’m glad I didn’t, for obviously  I am happy about it, just scared and confused.

114wlt0,Can inform me about my options.?,"Hello everyone about CA EBT rules and regulations due to the fact that I have been under my mom\\s case since I\\m guessing the start of the pandemic, I'm trying to find information on whether or not if someone else is in the same circumstances that I am in, I have called repeatedly to get my case separated in the state of California, but I am repeatedly told I cannot separate my case because I'm under hers. I don\\t understand because I have done this before the pandemic, is this something that started when the pandemic came about or is it because of the pandemic relief extra money they have been allotting to people that is set to expire next month? 

Even so I still don\\t understand why that would prevent me from separating my case from hers, my guess and this is only a guess is that it's easier for the county to not over allot extra payments to people? But I find that ridiculous cause everything is in their system, so they\\d be the ones controlling what's happening not me?

&#x200B;

The reason I'm asking is because I am not on speaking terms with my mother and it\\s a very challenging process to even deal with her so for a while now I have not been going to her for cash aid, instead relying on my stimulus payments. It's a long story but basically, I informed EDD/DPSS of this and they said they would send an escalation notice to the worker and within 3 business days I should hear back from them. I made this call on a Friday and checked back Monday even though I was told they would call me, no one answered, so I managed to call back the 3rd day and finally got someone on the phone who informed me my case was\\t able to be separated (they gave no reason or said it was part of their rules) but they kept saying I could be separated but only by her which made me more confused?! Because WHY? 

&#x200B;

They guy who told me to just wait till benefits ran out next month then I could apply on my own sent the escalation ticket when I informed him, she can be very confrontational and abusive so that is why I wasn't keen on asking for access from the card from her. I promptly informed him I been using my own savings for food ( I know that might not matter because benefits were allotted to all of us, I don\\t want the missing benefits I just want the case to be under my name so I don't have to use her card or go to her for those benefits that she's getting but I'm not even using for myself and yes it's fine if they restart my case with no money except for what\\s generally allotted.)

&#x200B;

So once I informed him of this circumstance that's when he found it necessary to issue an escalation notice to the eligibility workers, so I called and was told all of that basically and that I informed them I wanted my case separated but no one had called me yet so  she said she would submit it again for the second time but this time I noted she said I would have to keep up with them (I'm not foregoing the possibility the first guy told me that, but I am strongly in belief that was not the case the first time around) so I said okay, 

&#x200B;

I then asked some follow up questions I the event that would be denied anyways for whatever rules are in place, I asked the person I was speaking with if it's possible to get a separate EBT card to use under her case instead of a replacement that way I could access the benefits to instead of going directly to her for the card. 

&#x200B;

I was then told that it was an option unbeknownst to me at the time because no one had ever told me this before that the main case holder can do that by filling out a simple form that's available and submitting it to the office. (WHAT!?)

&#x200B;

You mean to tell me I could've had access to our benefits the entire time we were receiving them without having to go through the main case holder?!

&#x200B;

It still doesn't make sense why it\\s limited to her authorization only. The only reason I could think of is because she was the main one that filed and claimed me at the time for being under her case.  But even so it's ridiculous to tell me that I can't separate myself from her unless she wants it.

&#x200B;

Is it possible she made me out to be unable to care for myself and perhaps made it so that I wouldn't be able to separate myself? I am not one to jump to conclusions like that so easily, I am wondering if that's something EDD/DPSS does though? Because if so, I had no idea of that status of myself while on her case nor did I ever authorize her to do something like that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, in simplicity all I'm asking is whether someone knows in depth about how the case are being affected right now due to the pandemic and if they know they are doing this for everyone? Is there a way around this? I am in Los Angeles County by the way. Is anyone in similar situation? What advice do you recommend to me?

&#x200B;

Note: Please be kind and do not suggest I start talking to my mother, it is a personal situation and I understand not everyone will understand (or care for that matter) but as of right now it is not an option unless absolutely necessary and the only two scenarios, I can see something like that happening is if either:

1. I inform her and request to be separated from her benefits case.
2. I ask her to fill out the secondary EBT card authorization form and submit it to tithe office so I can get my own card to use my portion of the benefits with.

Shortly thereafter I submitted my change in phone number. (Still have access to my old number for now).
Haven’t heard anything. 
Status online says Pending.

I plan on calling as it’s been 30 days from the original application, but just curious if anyone knows about the average timeline right now?

Edit for clarity: I’m self employed, had a slump in income the last few months which is why I applied. The information they asked for was “exact dates” of my income. I provided that information (it’s not consistent like weekly or bi weekly, I get paid when I make sales, some items that’s $300 in a day, sometimes it’s $10 for the day, sometimes that’s $0 for a week. So I submitted bank statements 
 and business statements showing exact dates income deposits)
I was also doing a delivery gig when I applied but since then have lost my car, I wrote and signed a letter of explaining that I don’t make that Income anymore because of no vehicle, but i did provide the last pay statements).",,1676565724.0,foodstamps

I am the owner of the house and not on the benefits case to receive benefits (I make too much and did not apply). We have a 3 month old together that lives with us too. We did have a time where paperwork was filed as us being common law married in the past but since then she had put single status on future paperwork. 

Anyone know why they would want my status and cut off her benefits? Could it be the child? The common law statement? Or even living together?

Called the hotline and they stated that it was because I live in the same household as someone receiving benefits and would not say anything else (even had to get my tenant on the phone cause they would not talk to me even though they want info about me).

This is probably a weird question. I've been living with family for years but have been getting food stamps. I explained that I buy food and eat separately from them, which is the truth, and they granted me a decent amount per month. But it was my mom's house and she passed away not long ago. If I stay there I'm stuck living with my sister, her daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend. It's too small there and I hate the overall atmosphere.

I have a fiancé who was living in a medical rehab center after having a stroke. He was recently discharged and we have gotten a low income apartment together. It's illegal for me to use my food stamps to buy food for both of us, so we need to apply for him to get them too. Here is where my question comes in.

I have zero income. He has a military pension which isn't much but it's enough to pay our subsidized rent. He is still way below the poverty line and should be eligible for something. The dilemma is, how do we apply?

Should I tell them I'm moving in with him and then we apply as a couple? Or should we make an application for him alone and buy our food separately? Will aligning myself with another person take away my benefits, even if that other person is also low income? Has anyone here ever been in this situation? What did you do? How did it turn out?

10zsmym,Required to apply for 20 jobs in the next 10 days even though I quit because of my disability [Kansas],"In December, I finally reached a point where I realized I couldn't work anymore because of my disabilities, and left my job of 2 years. In January, a friend helped me with applying for SSDI, Food Assistance, and Medicaid. Yesterday I got a call from DCF to do my phone interview, and the worker said that I would need to fill out a job contacts form; from what I can see, it looks like it's asking me to apply for 20 jobs and write the contact information for all of them, and then turn in the form to DCF by 02/20/2023. I can try to apply for jobs, but that seems irresponsible knowing that I will be unable to work if I receive an offer. If I knew I could work, I would just go back to my previous job. I asked the worker if it was absolutely necessary for me to fill out the job contacts form in order to receive assistance, and she didn't give me a straight answer. Is there a specific way I should phrase this concern? Should I try again with a different worker?

&#x200B;

UPDATE 02/17/2023:  What ended up working was uploading the confirmation that I had applied for SSDI to the DCF online portal and then waiting on hold (yesterday 02/16/23 it took 6 hours and 19 minutes starting at 8:00 AM, in case anyone from KS is curious about the hold time to talk to a case worker) to explain that I had applied for disability benefits and I couldn't work at this time, so I wouldn't be able to turn in the job contacts form by/on 02/20/2023. The case worker was able to remove the job contacts form requirement and have my case approved! They suggested that I look into applying for vocational rehab but they didn't require that I do that or that I get a form from my doctor. ",fast-you-6423,1676135819.0,foodstamps

10ycz1r,Confused about household rules,"California, San Diego County. 

I live with my ex spouse (we are both women), who is disabled on SSI, we separated and divorced in 2018. We have two kids. She lives in our home, in her own room, does not buy or prepare food with anyone (she actually has a provider who comes help her with that), and our finances are separate. 

She only gets $1000 a month from SSI with her rent of $650, utilities added, car insurance, gas, etc. It leaves her with about $10 a week for food. She has to wait for the once a month when some neighbors bring some expired leftover food from stores that only last her about 3 days because the portions are very limited. This isn’t enough for her! She can’t do anything with the kids because she has no money. 

I am not responsible for her financially or in any way. I do not want to have to buy her food when I can barely afford my own for me and the kids!

But while she qualifies for calfresh on her own, they are refusing to separate the household despite the above facts. Can someone explain the logic to me? If anything, I believe she needs them more having kids in the home she can’t financially support during her visitation time. What is she supposed to do? There is nowhere else for her to move with her income so low, but she shouldn’t be starving because of this rule, nor should I be forced to buy her food (I’m actually not allowed to) when my budget is already so tight for having to pay for everything for the kids and paying more rent too.

For example, are cold rotisserie chickens allowed?  What about salad bars within a grocery store?  Is hot soup rejected?  What about gazpacho from the same soup bar?  Is there something that you're sure was eligible that was rejected?

10xqj92,question about work requirements,"hello, sorry to be a bother but currently I have a very particular question. my brothers wife was receiving snap benefits In Texas, they are married but living separately due to some family issues so he hasn't been on the benefits just her and his son. now, he's planning on moving her in with him and applying for benefit for the three of them. my question is, currently they both don't work they are both going to school, he takes care of our mother in exchange for rent, that is a daily thing and is sometimes there anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week. my mother is disabled and is considered a separate household. with that said they make do with their fafsa to cover bills, would they still be eligible for benefits? and would he still have to worry about the work requirements? or could he be considered self employed as he technically works for our mother as a caretaker in exchange for rent. the wife again is going to school as well and takes care of their 6 year old while also homeschooling him. due to this she isn't able to cover childcare or get childcare so she can work. 

thank you for reading and again sorry for the bother. any help or consideration would be very much helpful.",shadixmax,1675934857.0,foodstamps

10xm7s1,Need Food Stamp Advice Please (Florida),"Hi there. I've had food stamps for a while and have never gotten an E&T notice. I submitted my renewed food stamps application and on my application my hours were different from my paystubs which I explained are because my work is cutting peoples hours due to lack of business. I received a E&T notice in the mail that it was mandatory for me to participate since I didn't meet the work requirement. I forgot to add on my application that I work roughly 20 hours a week online for a remote job that pays me pennies, but still the work is being put in and I honestly didn't add it to the application because I didn't think it counted. I ended up trying to submit a ""good cause"" addendum to my application stating that and then panicked and closed my case because I didn't know what to do.

&#x200B;

My question is, since I didn't sign up for the E&T program (the deadline didn't happen yet) will something happen since I canceled my account? Will the food stamps money that I received for this month of food stamps be revoked? Any advice is extremely appreciated, this has never happened before and I'm scared because I have never been able to contact a representative for a question and since the interviews are waived right now it's even more impossible.

How does the reapplication process actually work and will it be okay if I just miss this interview, let the benefits stop and reapply that way with different caseworker later on? 

Firstly, I have anxiety. Last time I spoke with this particular caseworker, she was quite condescending, judgmental and withheld a specific task that needed to be completed for my application to be approved, resulting in a my application being denied. I had to speak with another caseworker to actually process my application correctly. In addition to the information that I correctly submitted, she simply needed to call a family member to verify who was in my household (she did not tell me this. at all.) and in her own way, told me to get a job. I don’t want to go through that again. My first caseworker and the nice older man who got my application properly submitted were angels to me. I don’t know why this particular caseworker is like this but I would rather eat canned tuna and saltines for a couple of months than be interviewed by her again. I never missed an interview before so I don’t really know how that works which is why I’m asking if it’ll be okay if I do so.

Do you think I’d be eligible for food stamps, or would they look and say that I have 6k stashed away and think that I don’t need it? The truth is I am able to meet all my bills when I factor in my grant money from my brokerage account, but it’s still a struggle now that groceries are so expensive.

As for my rent cost, $1,380 for a studio is actually a great price where I live in NJ, and I only do that because I’m a student and living on campus would come out to roughly $1,500/month, so while a $1,380/month studio apartment may be considered a luxury, it’s actually cheaper than living in campus.

10sqip7,Eligibility for food stamps,"Household of 4.

Living in NJ

Have vacant residential property in PA(Philadelphia)

I work salary is $60,600

Wife not working was layed off

One son working living with his girlfriend but still uses our mailing address. His salary is $48,300

Other son works 30 hours a week. He can’t work more because of mental illness. We had a hearing for SSI but they didn’t give him continued benefits. His salary is $16,000.

Son that works 30 hours a week is thinking about moving into a property we own in another state not too far from primary home. 

Couple of questions. Since we are struggling financially would son working 30 hours a week be eligible for food assistance? Or food assistance for the household? 

My take home salary after deductions is $34,000 and sons take home is $13,000. However our monthly expenses are $60,000 including everything. So as you can see even with combined income we are short.

Has anyone else in Texas experienced this? Getting extra deposits or way more than you're supposed to? What did you do?

10o5qtk,An error?,"I’m curious how common overpayment is on Texas SNAP. I had a hell of a time last year applying. Got denied about 2 times before getting approved. Since September of last year I had a pending application, that eventually got approved because the hospital here in town put in a Medicaid application in for my son, and got approved the next day. 

Got my first deposit early January, it was $1,700 in stamps. Initially, I thought that was weird and assumed it was pro-rated from applying back in September. Backpay. 

The only way I can justify the $1.7k is that when I initially saw I was approved, I saw it was ”approved” back in September, with a renewal date in February. Which later updated to starting 02/01 with renewal in August. The amount, the math, amount of months, it added up and that’s why I assumed it was correct. But there’s definitely an error.

Now, I’m thinking there has to be an error in the system. I got my usual deposit on the 26th of $506 (my first deposit, outside of that random $1.7k at the beginning of the month), which is the amount that I’m to get each month, which is fine and I’m more than okay with that. However, the next day, I got another deposit, which was in various deposits adding up to $1,251. That’s not right. Especially with a family of 3. 

I’m obviously going to call because there has to be an error and I’m not trying to commit fraud or get benefits that don’t belong to me. I’m wondering if anything like this has happened to anyone here and what the outcome was?

 This wasn’t deliberate on my part, like I said, I’m not trying to commit fraud. Has to be an error through Texas HHSC, and Monday morning I’m calling them.

They said they'd send it right away and it should show up in 4-7 business days.

My account online says my start date will be the first of February. I haven't yet received my EBT card, but that's not my concern.   


I'm just wondering what all these amounts are suppose to mean and if this is normal? It's listed under my ""Lone Star Card Activities"".  I also currently have over a thousand dollars in that card's balance which cannot be right, and I assume it was a coding error. What's happening here?

10nakpm,Stressed,Am I the only one that thinks applying for food stamps is stressful and stupidly irritating? Like they ask you who you live with and ask for social numbers and how much people make and all this shit and really you are only planning on getting food stamps for yourself and nobody else. I already pay for my own food but everything keeps getting more expensive and I want to save money for a car. Like seriously it doesn't matter who the hell I live with but pluss I don't get along with my family so what makes them think I just want to talk to my family and ask them to fill shit out so I can get food stamps. The whole process is just stupid as hell it's not like everyone in the house just buys food for everyone in the house. Someone will go to the store then I'll go to the store later to buy food for myself and they have there own stuff.

10mvrzl,Why do people turn down the $23 in benefits?,"Please, if you have a moment…I sincerely want to understand this line of thinking. I promise you I am not being sarcastic, but I just don’t understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it’s “not enough”?  I genuinely want to know. 

The current minimum SNAP benefit is $23. This is what most seniors receive. I hate that and I agree that is not enough. Obviously that’s not enough. But if you are hungry why would you turn down $23? The food pantry is not enough. If you are having trouble affording food, why turn down help?

Personally, I don’t qualify for anything anymore. But I think of it like, if a grocery store were to give me a $23 gift card every month I would love that. Even now, when I can afford to pay on my own. I would absolutely love a $23 bonus. 

Obviously it’s not enough to feed myself or my family but it’s enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs, bread, and milk. I see it as that’s $23 of my own money that I don’t have to spend on groceries. So that’s $23 more every month that could go towards bills, prescriptions, or whatever. 

I especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $23 because it’s not enough (which I agree) but then struggle to afford their meds, skip meals , pay late fees on their bills because they were $10 short, have $35 withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc. I know $23 is not enough, and I know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $23 is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount. 

Please help explain why so many people, especially seniors, turn down this benefit. I genuinely do not understand.",true_owl370,1674852883.0,foodstamps

10mlz5s,Calfresh letter of approval and denial - how to adjust current income?,"Hello friends, 

I just received a Notice of Calfresh Approval *and* Denial in the same mailing. Because I also received a card separately, hopefully I was approved? 🥹

My questions are about the current income shown and how to adjust it. The approval amount is for $23/mo, and it shows my income as $1950.30 and my IRT as n/a. When I applied I used old pay stubs, because I was just laid off, so the amount is much higher than my actual income. Since then, my only income has been a small amount from EDD, so my monthly income is not reflected accurately. 

- Is it possible to update the income to reflect the actual amount that is well under the amount reported? If so, what’s the best way to do that? Does this require an appeal, or can I call or submit an update somehow? 
- Does EDD payment count as income?
- Why is my IRT n/a? 

Apologies for all the questions, but I have been digging into so many documents and websites am pretty confused. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
