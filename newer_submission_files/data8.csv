16xnuvz,Applying for SNAP has become utterly pointless,"My father retired and I helped set him up to apply for food stamps so that he can receive benefits. They‚Äôre giving him only $23 a month. 

This is a man who has worked since a teenager and retired nearing 70. He‚Äôs been working minimum wage all his life. Sacrificing his body to provide. What does the program do? Give $23 in food assistance in a country where food has become a luxury than a necessity. 

What the hell is this? 

I‚Äôve read some people getting $200+ a month for food assistance, but I can‚Äôt seem to understand HOW. 

If you have a household of 4 people, why give $23? If you only apply with a household of 1 person, why is it still $23? 

It‚Äôs a broken system. And let‚Äôs say you have 4 people in the household. 2 of them (kids ages 18+) end up getting letters saying they need to participate in some E&T program. A program that‚Äôs mandatory to serve 80 hours a month in order to keep the food assistance of $200+. 

Like what? Those kids are in college or just live there. Why does it matter? Why does it also matter if the father is using food assistance to continue to provide his family? He‚Äôs retired. He needs the help. How else is he going to get money aside from what he gets from retirement that is ALL used to pay BILLS? 

I‚Äôm just ranting at this point. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm just frustrated and needed to vent.

---
**Edit 6/23** - Per FNS, the authoritative record for what waivers states are asking for is located [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/snap-waivers-flexibilities).

*link corrected - sorry,  FNS moved it when I wasn't looking*

---

Question:  *I live in ____ state, I just went though redetermination/renewal, and now they're saying my amount is ____ which is way less than the _____ that I was getting before.  Why?*

Answer:  This is almost certainly due to the reversion to normal, or as close to it as things are likely to get at this point.  Your new benefit amount is very likely the **actual calculated benefit amount** based on your income, resources, household size, and countable expenses.

*Why is this happening?*

In 2020, the federal government, as a part of the COVID19 response, massively expanded SNAP benefits, for any state that had declared a state of emergency related to the pandemic, which was pretty much every state.  That initial burst of funding ended in March, and then was extended for several more months.  it is important to remember that this is a ***departure from program policy*** as an emergency measure **only**, and should not be construed as a change in business.

*What's changing, and what's staying the same?  I heard it's going to be this way until September...?*

The additional 15% benefit amount is staying the same through the end of September.  Other state waivers that allow up-to-max-benefits are likely ending at the end of June.  At this time (mid-June) we have no information about what states may continue to receive that waiver for July, because it is approved on a month-by-month basis.  I would speculate that it will actually end June 30, because that's when the lion's share of the additional funding goes away, and most states don't have the reserves to continue to pump money into the program.

*Will I receive any kind of notice about this?*

No, you probably won't.  The reason is that the feds classify a change like this as a ""mass change"", which is specifically excluded from having a reduction notice.  Updates will probably be news releases and social media, but they won't send you anything specifically telling you.  If you've been surprised by this, this is probably the reason - if it helps, understand that a widespread notice by mail costs tens of thousands of dollars, which is probably the main reason there isn't a notice that goes out.  Yes, it sucks, and we know it.

q7p5wb,Thank you to SNAP workers.,"I am not posting this as a question or a complaint... I am posting this as a genuine a heartfelt thank you for the people who work for SNAP/Medicaid LIHEAP and any other Human Services department.

The last few years of my life have been the most difficult of my life and you were there for me when no one else was. You made sure my heat wouldn't get turned off. You kept food in my belly. You paid for my internet so I could still see my mother on her deathbed in the middle of the pandemic from hundreds of miles away.

The work you do, affects so many in personal ways. Its my prayer that you understand just how important what you do is. And yes I know you can deal with rude, and some ungrateful people. But you do the right thing because its the right thing and not depending on how this person acts.

As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety I know I can be a real asshole to deal with at times and I am blessed people in your field understand not to hold that to me when I lose myself in the moment and may be awkward scared or upset. I worked in healthcare directly with the public for 16 years before I got sick, having to deal with people like me, and I have an amazing amount of respect for people that are able to.

I guess what I am saying is thank you, and thank the lord almighty I live in a country that helps me and my family. As divided and diverse as I am sure the people on this group are as poverty knowns no race or religion. No demographic is immune from it. We can all agree, that we are blessed and or lucky depending your belief system, that we have this safety net. Please treat your caseworkers with respect and consideration for the magnitude of responsibility they have to make sure people are taken care of.

Woah, that was a little more then I originally intended on writing.. Uh yeah so thank you.

q8w4b5,THANK YOU FOR A 2ND CHANCE AT LIFE,"I got EBT for the first time today in Cali. It's going to save me and my best friends lives. We've been living off 4-5$ a day for 2 years. Mostly a diet of whole wheat bread, eggs, brown rice, lentils, oats and whole grain pasta. When there was room in the budget we'd get onions, garlic, bananas, apples, frozen vegetables, milk, yogurt, or cheese. When we had rare opportunities to spend a bit more we would buy 1-2 lbs of meat and try to spread it out over 7 meals. Sometimes they'd have special deals on different things or give out free stuff which we would always be on top of.

We have to walk several hours to get anything we need and that's only after couponing for hours to find things we can barely afford. All during this pandemic. It's a dreadful feeling to just survive and walk to feed yourself every day knowing you're not even hitting all the food groups. All of my socks are destroyed full of holes and my feet are blistered. There was no money for anything extra except cleaning supplies, no health insurance so if something went wrong we were screwed. The way this has affected my best friend was the worst part, running out of money and looking for change to pay for couponed bread and seeing the look on their face knowing it was just gonna be more of this. Getting fruits/vegetables felt like a luxury. All these grains had us feeling sluggish and depressed.

Now what little we had in our lives was coming to an end too, and homeless was looming, so I looked for help and found out about the EBT process. I applied and got it almost instantly. I just got home after finishing it and knowing it was expedited and it's safe and sound and real. It doesn't feel real. The lady who helped me on the phone was amazingly helpful and kind and continued to help me throughout the process until the end. The ladies at the office I went to today were also just as helpful and kind. I felt like I was dealing with caring people who had compassion and understanding. I don't really have family near me to depend on and I didn't trust I would qualify for any help from government, but after seeing how quickly my life just got beyond saved... I feel stupid for not getting help sooner. The amount of EBT covering our food is probably 4x the amount we were spending on things for our selves in a month, and that's counting cleaning supplies.

With EBT covering our food (and being able to buy a variety of vegetables/fruits/meat/etc) we can now afford to buy bikes and find work and save our lives and get out of this mess. The 3 hour walk of doom can now be a half hour commute. On the most positive side, I went from 450 to 190 lbs. So, I feel blessed for a 2nd chance.",ireallylovechicken,1634327706.0,foodstamps

pbzp6q,A moratorium on questions that are beyond our scope to answer.,"Over the last couple of weeks, the sub has gotten flooded with questions only tangentially related to the SNAP program. Public assistance is difficult sometimes to navigate: we get it...**but**...a large number of these questions are about subjects that aren't something anyone here can answer.  Examples:

*I am still waiting on ___. DAE have this problem?*

This is very low-effort. We can tell you,  if we know, what the policy is about why information is needed, or help you figure out what to do about a delay is service delivery. We might even be able to help you connect with the agency you're working with if you're getting frustrated...but those answers are going to have to come from the agency.  They're the ones holding the reins. 

*My EBT card doesn't work at this retailer in this specific location. Anybody know why?*

The answer to this is almost certainly one of two things : either your account doesn't have the balance you think it does and it's getting rejected for insufficient funds, or there is a problem with either the retailer's EBT processing or with the EBT system in that area in general. Neither possibility is something that we're in a position to help with.

*I haven't gotten the PEBT card/funds, and my friend got theirs*

PEBT is functionally identical to SNAP at the user end, but it's a completely separate program with different requirements, criteria, and funding stream that is administered at a local level by agencies whose waivers on implementation vary by school district. Saying we have no idea is a gross understatement. 

We may be able to tell you when funds are coming or if they're coming...but this is the main thing we're seeing over the last couple of weeks that I alluded to above as an adjacent program. PEBT is a parallel track to SNAP that uses a lot of the same infrastructure underneath.

We're going to be modifying the sub rules and Automod responses to give better answers, as well as point people towards resources, and the FAQ will get updated as soon as we're able.

Note that it's higher than SNAP maximum benefit charts you may have seen because there is also a temporary 15% short-term increase to all SNAP benefits that is now extended through at least September and (as per the bill) should remain in place ""for as long as needed based on economic conditions"".

*  Raising the floor and ceiling - My understanding is that the new omnibus spending bill raised both minimum and maximum allotment amounts for all households through June 30 2021.

*  Pandemic supplemental - Independently of the raise in amounts,  states are asking for on a month-to-month basis to issue up to the max amount. January amounts have been announced for some states as of this morning,  but that's being slower than it has been.  Refer back to your state agency on this - we may know here, or we may not.

10mvrzl,Why do people turn down the $23 in benefits?,"Please, if you have a moment‚Ä¶I sincerely want to understand this line of thinking. I promise you I am not being sarcastic, but I just don‚Äôt understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù?  I genuinely want to know. 

The current minimum SNAP benefit is $23. This is what most seniors receive. I hate that and I agree that is not enough. Obviously that‚Äôs not enough. But if you are hungry why would you turn down $23? The food pantry is not enough. If you are having trouble affording food, why turn down help?

Personally, I don‚Äôt qualify for anything anymore. But I think of it like, if a grocery store were to give me a $23 gift card every month I would love that. Even now, when I can afford to pay on my own. I would absolutely love a $23 bonus. 

Obviously it‚Äôs not enough to feed myself or my family but it‚Äôs enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs, bread, and milk. I see it as that‚Äôs $23 of my own money that I don‚Äôt have to spend on groceries. So that‚Äôs $23 more every month that could go towards bills, prescriptions, or whatever. 

I especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $23 because it‚Äôs not enough (which I agree) but then struggle to afford their meds, skip meals , pay late fees on their bills because they were $10 short, have $35 withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc. I know $23 is not enough, and I know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $23 is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount. 

Please help explain why so many people, especially seniors, turn down this benefit. I genuinely do not understand.",true_owl370,1674852883.0,foodstamps

I am seventy years of age,  retired with Social Security income only.  I live alone in my paid off home in Seattle, Wa.  

That happens to provide me with a $16/month benefit.  Is that worth applying for?

Yes.  For April and May my benefit goes up to about $170  because the SNAP benefit is temporarily increasing to the maximum regardless of income because of the virus.

The City of Seattle owns it's own electric utility service,  and discounts the cost of electric service for me by about 50% because I qualify for SNAP benefits.  That's true for the city's water,  sewer and garbage utility service as well.

The city also has an extra charge for auto license tabs that I get discounted by $20/year because of SNAP benefits.

I completed that training,  but unfortunately the shutdown of 737 MAX production and now the virus has meant I haven't found the job I had anticipated  ----which would have got me off of SNAP benefits.

We are spending too many days trying to plug in missing information that should already be with the application, and this was never an issue before. Those are weeks we could have used to process thousands of new applications.

*Always* provide verification of your ID, address, income, rent/mortgage, child care, and past due bills with your application. Employers and landlords rarely disclose information to us.

Provide 2 representative check stubs from the last 45 days that include your name, your employer's name, gross income, hours, and pay date. *Please no screenshots of your direct deposit or your payroll app that doesn't show names.*

If you are self employed, keep your earnings tracked on a calendar. You can submit the previous 2 complete months or the last 4 pay dates if you are paid weekly, biweekly, or semi-monthly if you have a fixed schedule. If your boss pays you in cash or personal check with no deductions, have them write it. And always date and sign this.

You get help for rent, utilities, child support, toiletries, etc.? Get verification of how they help you, 1 amount of how much they give you or pay for you, and how often they help you. Have them sign, date, and put a phone number. If you are past due, provide your bills.

**Edit 2**: as suspected, the number of states has changed. Look for this trend to continue,  as it's evident the feds are updating one state at a time. 

**Edit 3 for June 2021**:  Due to guidance from the feds, if you have a *calculated benefit amount* of **$0**, you will no longer be receiving any additional EA benefits. This likely means that you've been receiving the max like everyone else and will now get nothing. I suggest calling your elected representatives in DC if you're exercised about this,  as IMO it's kind of a shitty thing to do to people.

Understandably, we're getting a lot of questions about this topic at the moment - this thread is intended to stem the tide a bit, so please keep commentary and questions on this topic here for the time being.

**What we know**:  ~~As of 4/6~~ Per the federal [Food & Nutrition Services page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/covid-19-emergency-allotments-guidance), ~~16~~ many states have been approved for the Emergency Allotment waiver.  I will hazard a guess that there are more in the pipeline, but because these waivers are granted at the state's request on a monthly basis, this is obviously subject to change on a state-by-state basis.

[Guidance from FNS as of 4/1/21](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-covid-emergency-allotments-phase-3-guidance.pdf) indicates that FNS is expanding benefits for those states still in an emergency status to increase allotments up to $95/mo, for those households that have received less than a $95/mo increase from the Emergency Allotment waiver thus far.

Because these changes will require additional updating of the data systems used to support SNAP issuance, it is possible, even likely, that some delays in the timing of these benefit implementation dates will occur.  Again, because this is managed at the local agency level, what state or county you live in will be highly relevant in answering those questions - please understand that agencies are getting this information at nearly the same time that the public is being informed...so they may or may not have answers in the moment.

> Can State agencies use EA to offset a SNAP overpayment claim? 
> Response: No. Over-issuances of SNAP benefits cannot be collected from EA.

That means if your state is taking part or all of your increased emergency benefits (this is apart from your 'normal' benefit allotment), they are in violation of federal guidance. Let us know if this is happening to you. 

E.G. normally you would be approved for $100 in SNAP, but with the emergency increase you're receiving the maximum $234 per month. You had a previous overpayment claim against you, and the state is taking over $100 per month from you (even as much as the full $234).

fhwhdc,How Far Will $15 in Snap Benefits GO?,"A couple of years ago I applied for SNAP benefits.  I am 70 years of age now and have zero earned income ----SS only.

I own my home with no mortgage,  which is a big benefit for me.

I was awarded a $15/month SNAP benefit.  So how far does that go?

Well,  Seattle charges an arm and a leg for water,  sewer and garbage service,  and charges a lot for car license tabs as well.  However,  since I am on SNAP,  I get a discount of about half on my WS&G bill and a rebate of $20/year on renewing license tabs.  I get internet service from COMCAST for $10/month as negotiated with Seattle.

I already get bus fares reduced from #2.75 to $1.00 as a senior,  but if I didn't SNAP benefits would get me a similar cheap fare.

I visit the local food bank once a week,  which provides a lot of food.

I also dumpster dive a couple of nearby grocery stores.  One provides me with more meat than I can eat  (that included a rib eye steak and a whole ham I'm still eating off of a couple of weeks ago).  The other provides me with far more fresh fruits and vegetables than I can eat.  I usually pick out ten pounds of oranges and a bunch of lemons and limes to squeeze on my  Mixmaster Model 12 mixer with the citrus squeezer attachment I have.

In January, 2019 I signed up for a CNC Machining Class offered at a nearby college.  I completed the three quarter certificate program there at the end of the summer,  with the State of Washington picking up the $1800/quarter tuition costs  because I'm on SNAP.

There is lots in the media from last week, and already this week,  about coming changes to the SNAP/Food Stamp program due to the COVID pandemic. This thread will be an attempt to keep all of that in one place rather than a series of isolated posts in the same topic.

Questions go here - please make them a top level comment so they're seen.  I'll have a stickied comment at the top that I'll try to update as things change. 

For non-SNAP questions about COVID, please visit r/coronavirus. 

We're all in this together - it's going to be okay.

16q5tqm,My husbands 18 year old nephew just moved in with us.,"He was finally able to leave his guardians and move in with us.

We are retired but still bring in around $45k a year.  Still, its hard with food prices these days and this boy eats like a horse.

He was taken out of high school by his guardian and unable to return because he is not on target to graduate. He is now enrolled in Penn Foster.

He is ADHD and Autistic but not on any kind of disability.

If he applied for foodstamps would our income disqualify him?  I believe he is on Medicaid, his grandma has that information. Problem is he has been tossed around from family to family for so many years he has no paperwork.  His mother says she will help with the paperwork but she is a methhead and not very reliable.

Almost to 10k members!,"Today is my cake day, and so as a participant and mod I wanted to give a big **THANK YOU** to everyone who participates here helping each other out with an incredibly complex, often under-resourced program which helps so many people. We're just shy of **10,000 members**, which makes me very happy to see.

I know how many Redditors here also respond to questions on top of many day-job hours and life struggles of their own.

I also have a cake day request: we post and reply here helping each other with really hard and often negative stuff. But **I'd love to hear a positive story or two** from your experiences; if a staff member has gone above and beyond, if EBT has really helped, that kind of thing.

I know that may be a strange request! But I think with things being so hard sometimes, it helps to share the positive stuff we've seen. (Also it's my cake day! ;P)

11b7e1n,PSA for anyone that uses Instacart and pays with EBT,"Hey all, new to the community.

I'm in Washington State. I recently found out that you could order groceries on Instacart and pay with EBT. While going over the receipt to see the charges today, I noticed that I was charged for bags and a bag tax. If you guys don't know, any person receiving any type of public assistance is exempt from the bag fees and taxes.

When I called to speak to them, they said they do not offer refunds and that I needed to look at the fine print for this. Hung up the call, then went to create an order to see the fine print. This is what it says: "" A bag fee may be added to your final total if required by law or the retailer. The fee will be visible on your receipt after delivery. ""

I called them back to ask again. The next person I got continued to tell me the same thing, however, after checking on the [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov) website this is what it says under exceptions:

* The fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Food Assistance Program (FAP).

The person put me on hold, and then came back to tell me that upon review, they will give me a refund ""this time"" and all I needed to do was send them an email at the generic 'help' email address. If you have used this service, check your receipts.",latinashrty,1677286188.0,foodstamps

121s03l,Beware of instacart,"I recently ordered from aldi (aldi partnered with instacart) and they never delivered my food almost 800 dollars worth of food I saved months to be able to order. I have disabilities and rely on grocery delivery but every single time I order they don't read the count of the expensive items like meat and veggies and they bring me half my order. This last order they completely didn't deliver and when I disputed with them they legit sent me an email saying they checked GPS and the chat and found irregularities and were deactivating my account unless I disputed the deactivation. They took the food stamps and charged me 100 dollars on my bank card and I got nothing. 

I sent them a follow up email and sent pics of my kitchen fridge and freezer and its been 3 days and I haven't heard anything back from them. I'm letting you all know do not use them or you will get screwed over. I posted about it on fb to warn others and figured I'd post here as well. Now I have to call my bank and report them as well but I know I won't get anyone on the phone for ebt and now I'm very low on my emergency food and very frustrated about this. 

Also I hear Sam's club does free delivery so I'll be using them in the future after I deal with this problem. Going to report them to the better business bureau as well and see what a case worker says. üò°",balanced_coi,1679763721.0,foodstamps
x42vlt,Rules update: Soliciting or offering personally identifiable information,"Good morning, or evening, or whatever time of day it is where you are.  :)

This isn't a new concern, but it's come up from time to time, and the other mods and I felt it was appropriate to clarify, update the rules, and explain to the community what the change is and why it's being made.

A core concept with working in a human services capacity is the adherence at all times to a high ethical standard, and protecting personally identifiable information from misuse.  

In the sidebar, it says, ""All program experts participating are doing so in their private capacity - no advice given here should be construed as speaking on behalf of any federal, state, or local agency.""  The reason this is there is because Reddit is not an official channel for information to get from Agency to customer or vice versa - it's anonymous, and needs to stay that way.

If you have questions, you should never, under any circumstances, provide your personally identifiable information to someone on Reddit. This puts you in a compromised position, and opens you up to the possibility of having that information misused, stolen, or otherwise compromised....and you should be aware that there is a growing ""recovery scam"" where scammers will ask for your information, knowing that you're already vulnerable.

If you're an expert, or you work in human services and want to help - people asking for help here need to be directed back to their local agency if it gets beyond general program help or advice.  You should never solicit or accept personally identifiable information - doing so means you are no longer operating in a private capacity, because you're offering to use your professional credentials without a valid business purpose, for someone whose identity you have not confirmed.  This poses a risk to this subreddit, to you personally, and potentially to either the customer who is asking for help, or to someone seeking to misuse that information.  Because Reddit is anonymous, providing them any help from that risks a disclosure of protected information, completely aside from HIPAA.

I am leaving this post open for now, for commentary and discussion from the community, but please keep it constructive.",slice_of_pi,1662128782.0,foodstamps
umvc7s,"Several very cheap, nutritious, and tasty meal options when relying on EBT/SNAP","I attended 2 different Culinary schools and have a BAS in culinary arts, but am only a hobbyist, as working in the industry started to quickly ruin my love for cooking. Anyways, I have been trying to find meals with the best ratio of price vs # of servings vs nutrition vs yummies, and while I am still playing around with some meals, but I wanted to throw out a few suggestions. 

All of the prices are from Amazon Prime Fresh, which accepts EBT/SNAP in California at least, not sure about other states, and does not require a prime membership if using EBT. Prime Fresh has been a life saver, letting me have teh chance to really think about what I am buying and adding up prices, rather than having to worry about getting to checkout and not having enough EBT... They also have a lot more items, and the deals are better, plus you get free delivery to your door. 

The first meal is Tuna Salad.

On Amazon Fresh, these are the ingredients/prices:

StarKist Chunk Light Tuna In Water, 11 oz Pouch StarKist Chunk Light Tuna In Water, 11 oz Pouch $4.79

Kraft Real Mayo Creamy & Smooth Mayonnaise (12 fl oz Bottle) $3.19

Amazon Brand - Happy Belly Sweet Relish, 10 Ounce $1.19

Celery 1 Bunch $1.99

Yellow Onion $1.19

Final Price: $12.35 However, You can get several salads out of the ingredients, minus the tuna, so I suggest you get 2 or 3 of the 11 oz Tuna Packets.. One of them makes enough Tuna to last 5 days with 2 people, eating 2 sandwiches a day..  The biggest issue is that Tuna salad has a fridge life of 5 days, meaning you might not even be able to finish it all. $16 for 2 weeks of food... Not bad. 

Another affordable meal, (can be a meal or an ingredient) is Brussel Sprouts.  You can get a 12 oz bag of trimmed brussel sprouts for $2.99 and all you need is some kosher salt and butter... Melt the butter in a pan, trim the bottom stem off the brussel sprouts so they cook evenly, cut in half and place in the pan with a decent pinch of kosher salt over them. Let them cook until brown or almost looking burnt, then flip and continue until they are soft and easy to eat. Most people can't believe just how yummy they are when fried or baked (never boil, icky), plus cheap, and amazingly.... a 12 oz bag has 145 calories only, which can easily feed 2-3 people, giving you a filling snack at under $100 calories...  

If you want to take it further, you can go the Bubble'n'squeak route by adding a couple eggs after they are done cooking and some cheese.. 3 eggs and some cheddar only adds 250 calories to the meal.. and an 18 pack of eggs is under $5, and cheese varies a lot but can be found cheap too. 

I have also managed to get my EBT to last longer by getting Slim Fast shake powder $8.79 plus the price of dairy, I get the 96 Oz Vanilla Almond Breeze for $4.09. this gives you 14 meals for $12.88 and is actually pretty effective at weight loss, as long as you stick to the 4 100 calorie snacks and one meal a day, else your body starts to hold on to more fat  and it backfires. This is where the Brussel Sprouts come into play, as 100 calorie snacks. 

For a quick and cheap meal. Stir Fry Rice-A-Roni is $1.09 a box, and  actually pretty good.

And finally, Bear Creek Soups. They range from $3.59 to $4.79, and make 8 LARGE servings of incredibly yummy soup that takes 15 min or so to cook, just pour in the mox, add water and boil. However, One of the BEST meals they have is the ""Damn Good Chili"" but that does require 1lb of ground beef and a small can of tomato paste, but it lasts for several days and is really good chili. Other than that, I highly recommend the Cheddar potato and Cheddar brocolli, though all of the soups are really good, better than any canned soup, and they have at least 15 different flavors.

sm7t8w,EBT tips,"I have a few tips for EBT food stamps users. I just recently found out that the Starbucks in my local Safeway works with my EBT food benefits.

Ask them to scan that to pay for it there so if your drink doesn‚Äôt get covered at least they‚Äôll just think you were trying to use your benefits only for the bag of chips. It‚Äôs worth a try. 
I also use the ‚ÄòFetch‚Äô rewards app to scan my receipts for my EBT purchases and any other purchases. You can get rewards gift cards after getting up to a certain amount of points. 
Also if you‚Äôre trying to get valentines for your kids ‚Äòusually‚Äô any valentines with food in it (candy usually) is eligible for EBT. 
If you can not shop at your store because you don‚Äôt have time or physically can‚Äôt or whatever your reason then just know with Safeway pickup and Walmart grocery pickup you can order through the app and use your EBT card. I like this better because it will decipher what items are eligible for EBT and what ones are not.

Please be aware of phishing and skimming schemes that have increased significantly in volume across the nation in recent months. Protect yourself and your card because SNAP funds are not replaceable in most states due to federal rules.

***Skimming*** devices placed on ATMs and points-of-sale (where you swipe your card, including grocery and convenience stores) record your EBT card number and personal identification number (PIN). That information is then used to create a copy of your card (called a *clone*), which is then used to withdraw cash funds or make SNAP purchases from your account. 

**Protect yourself from** ***skimming***. Do a quick scan before using any machine, take a look to make sure it hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.  Check the keypad or swiping device (called an *overlay*) to see if it's loose, if the numbers are hard to press, or if anything else looks suspicious. **Change the PIN** **to your card** as often as you can, and use a different PIN each time.

***Phishing*** schemes begin with an email, phone call or text message to cardholders telling them that their card has been 'blocked' or that there is some other problem with their card. The messages provide a phone number or other way in which you are asked to provide your EBT card number, PIN or other personal information. These messages and the phone numbers they ask you to call can look and sound **very similar to ones you receive from your SNAP agency but they are fake** systems designed to steal your information. 

**Protect yourself from** ***phishing***. Do **not provide your** **PIN to anyone, ever**, including your SNAP agency or caseworker. Your SNAP agency will not (and should not) ever ask your for your PIN.",kmimr,1660395417.0,foodstamps

I am obviously not going to be able to feed her on my $50 per month foodstamps, she will have to buy her own food and toiletries. But if we put both our incomes together, we would be over the foodstamps limit. She doesn't plan to ask for foodstamps, although I believe she still might have Medicaid for being a former foster child. Her asthma inhalers are being paid for by Medicaid.

Is there any way I can do this without losing my foodstamps and QMB? Cause I can not afford to cut my own throat to help someone else, but I would really like to help her out.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

While getting the information I need on how to proceed, she told me that since the 29th of August, they have been aware of mass fraud in the EBT system, thousands of accounts being hacked but they don't know how. She told me that they were putting into place something to help people get their money back. I couldn't get any more information than that. 
Had to file a fraud report with local police then take that to DSS. 
How is it that their system is so weak to hacking? This has to be a vulnerability in their tech, their database or servers, right?

y7nnd7,My experiences for dealing with EBT theft. (California),"Hi, everyone! Today as of 10/18, I‚Äôve finally got my stolen amount reimbursed into my EBT account, here‚Äôs what I go through with the whole process: 
1. When you found out your EBT cash benefit was stolen, first thing you need to do is call the number at the back of the EBT card and talk to a customer service representative to report your card has been skimmed, and tell them how much money has been stolen, remember to ask for a claim number.
2. Go to the police station and file an report, in my case I went to the sheriffs department. Make sure you mention to the officer, the report is for EBT theft and it‚Äôs requested by county worker.
3. After you gather those two informations(Claim number and police report), you can go to your nearest social service county office to fill out the EBT2259„ÄÅEBT2259A„ÄÅPA1130„ÄÅPA853 forms. The good things for fill out those forms in county office is, the county workers will help you fill out those forms and make sure there‚Äôs no mistake while you fill those out; they will give you a ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù saying that they receive those forms and police report, and they can issue you a new EBT card, so you don‚Äôt need to wait for the new card in mail.
3. Give it about 20 business days, if you don‚Äôt receive any letters regarding the claim, you need to call the DPSS customer services number. Because they are overwhelmed by the large number of EBT theft cases now, sometimes your claim might be left behind, when you call in the customer service just mention that you don‚Äôt receive any letters or follow ups for your EBT card claim, they‚Äôll leave a note in the system or expedite your case movement.

For my case, it took 28 days for the stolen benefit to be reimbursed.

il03hm,First year college students apply for Calfresh and basically got threatened by the caseworker,"Santa Clara County, CA

I and my brothers decided to move out of our parents' home for personal reason. We go to college in the same city where my parents live. We apply for Calfresh and the caseworker continuously made remarks about we could have been lying about moving out since our parents' home is in the same city. We provided proof of income from unemployment, financial aid and also expenses such as rent; however, during the interview, she kept implying we are lying about moving out, and it is weird and unusual to not live with parents, asking about the dependency status on our parents' taxes, etc. She kept saying that I and my brother are so young, only freshmen in college, it would raise a question on the application and our case might get investigated. I am just baffled with the entire interview experience. 

So my question is: is our case really weird and special and worth investigating? Does dependency on parent's tax affect our Calfresh eligibility? Do Calfresh caseworker this hostile towards applicants?

Update: I received a phone call from an investigator this morning. However, I was in class and wasn't able to pick up. Did my case get send to an investigator?

icv19y,Venting. Roommate lied on his snap application & did fraud and now uses all his ebt to buy soda and red bull..,"My roommate who never once paid rent as agreed (can't evict yet due to covid law!) got food stamps about 3 weeks ago.  He lied on his application.  He told them that he was making his own food and buying it separately so that his app wouldn't be based on his other roommates' wages. If he used our info on the application, he'd have been denied.  He marked down that for the past 6 months he's been buying his own food.  Thus,  he got retro pay.  It was a lie. 

 He never once cooked or bought food. My other roommates and I fed him 3 meals per day, plus snacks and drinks. He never once bothered to help cook or clean after eating. 

I told him 3 weeks ago that he needs to contact our county's welfare board and explain that he will not be using the retro pay,  as it's illegal, but that he could still use future SNAP, as long as he didn't share food with us.  He had replied that he doesn't care if he goes to jail. I explained that he put me in a bad spot! He only thinks of himself.   How about the fact that now I have this weighing on my mind that he was stealing from those who needed it??? And that he got retro pay that he banked off of, when the ""retro"" reality was actually all my money spent on him?!

So,  I reported him to SNAP.  I don't really feel bad. I even warned him that I would be reporting him if he didn't comply.  He knew he was making me feel uncomfortable.  He also isn't starving.  He spent all the back pay on convenience-store-purchased Red Bull and a TON of soda. I'm talking about $35 a day just on soda.    Granted, he did buy a few Banquet frozen dinners. The bulk was candy bars.  That's what he's eating all day.   

How is it even legal that he can buy nothing but Red Bull and soda?  He's clearly taking advantage of the system.  How are there not ""caps"" on certain items? Surely,  one does not need 3 cans of Red Bull per day.  That's also bad on his heart. And $10/ day on nonsense.  I understand you may think it's none of my business what he spends his EBT money on,  but it sort of is.   Regardless,  the SNAP program is broken.  


 Now he ran out of snap and expects to eat here. Like I'm gonna turn away a hungry person? He knows I won't turn him away because I have a heart,  but I'm enabling him. He put me in a catch 22, preying on my weakness.  He's soon to be legally evicted,  as the courts here are finally starting to hear cases again after its ~6 month hiatus.

e6rc8k,What Does the New Food Stamp Rule About Work Requirements Mean for the Program?,"Hey everyone,

You've likely heard that there's a new final rule regarding work requirements for the food stamp program that is slated to go into effect in April 2020. I'm here to tell you what that means for the program.

First, here's [the USDA's press release on the rule](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-120419). 

**What the rule changes**

Some food stamp participants (able bodied adults without dependents) must work 20 hours/week to receive benefits. States have been able to waive the work requirement in areas (e.g. regions, counties) for reasons like high unemployment. This helps people stay on the program during economic downturns. During the recession, every state but one waived work requirements in at least part of the state. 

The new rule:

1. Only allows states to waive work requirements if unemployment is at least 6%, *and* is 20% higher than the national average. This is a higher standard than before.

2. No longer allows states to waive the work requirement based on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. States must rely on historical unemployment data, which can take a little longer to acquire. 

**Who the rule affects**

Anti-poverty groups estimate that about [700,000 people will lose program benefits](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/new-snap-rule-would-cost-many-of-nations-poorest-their-food-aid) because of the new changes (some areas will no longer be eligible for the waiver, and so the work requirements will kick that many people off the program). The USDA estimates that this will save about $1 billion per year (the program currently costs about $65 billion annually). 

**What happens now**

As I mentioned, the rule is slated to go into effect in April 2020. What's likely, however, is that the USDA will be sued by anti-poverty organizations, which will delay rule implementation while the courts determine whether the rule is legal. 

We recommend checking back in March 2020 to see whether the rule will go into effect. If it does, and you're in an area with waived work requirements, check with your state agency to determine whether you'll be affected by the change. 

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you!",thesongofstorms,1575595690.0,foodstamps
ajyie2,SNAP Update 1/25/19 - What Does The End of the Govt. Shutdown Mean for Food Stamps?,"Hey y'all,

~~I'm speculating without any direct guidance from FNS, but based on what we saw recently, here's what I believe the end of the government shutdown means for the program for the next few months~~:

EDIT 1/28/19 @ 4:30 EST: I was able to confirm via FNS that the following information is true. FNS is also concerned about the 40+ lag in benefits for some participants and is weighing possible options.

EDIT 1/31/19 @ 9:30 EST: Q&A from FNS: https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/snap/SNAPFacts1-29-19.pdf

* The three week continuing resolution (CR) ends on February 15

* All February benefits are guaranteed (ongoing cases should have received theirs as early issuance in January-- **HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVED EARLY ISSUANCE WILL NOT RECEIVE MORE BENEFITS IN FEBRUARY WITHOUT SOME SORT OF FNS INTERVENTION**)

* This means that any financial obligations owed by the government (such as food stamp benefits and admin dollars) can be paid out for the 30 days following the (CR), or until **March 17, 2019**

* Therefore, March food stamp benefits should be guaranteed and paid out as normal

* ~~If there is *another* government shutdown following this CR, then April benefits could be paid out by March 15 as early issuance~~ Another shutdown was averted and an appropriations bill was passed that is good through the rest of the federal fiscal year (until October 2019).

**Upshot** ~~I believe FNS will confirm next week that~~ March/April benefits will be guaranteed for ongoing cases and recertifications that are processed before March 15",thesongofstorms,1548483871.0,foodstamps

Some key points:

* **February 2023:** By law, state agencies were required to submit their state plan \[for replacing stolen benefits\] to FNS by Feb. 27, 2023.
* **March 2023 and forward:** FNS is reviewing and approving state plans for implementation. We have [compiled a list](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals) of approved state plans and estimated implementation dates. State plans will remain in effect until new FNS regulations on benefit replacements, issued under this new authority, take effect.

**Tips for SNAP Participants:**

* **Avoid simple PINs**. Number combinations such as 1111, 1234 or 9876 may be easy for others to guess.
* **Keep your PIN and card number secret**. Do not share your PIN or card number with anyone outside your household. Cover the keypad when you enter your PIN on a machine.
* **Beware of phishing**. State agencies and EBT processors will never call or text to ask for your PIN or card number.
* **Change your PIN often**. Change your PIN at least once a month, right before your benefit issuance date.
* **Check your EBT account regularly for unauthorized charges**. If you see any, change your PIN right away to stop the thief from making new purchases. Report suspicious activity to your [local SNAP office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).
* **Contact your local SNAP office**. If you think you are the victim of card skimming and your SNAP benefits were stolen, contact your [local SNAP office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).",daguar,1678899682.0,foodstamps

pjv78z,SNAP Benefits to Increase In October ‚Äì What Will An Increase Mean For You?,"Hi, my name is John Puterbaugh and I‚Äôm a journalist with NextAdvisor, the personal finance section of TIME (https://time.com/nextadvisor/). I‚Äôm working on a story about the SNAP benefits increase that is set to take effect next month (https://time.com/6090755/food-stamp-increase-biden/). The increase is expected to be about $36 per person per month on average.

I am hoping to learn from current SNAP recipients how much of an impact an increase like this would make for your monthly grocery budget. Along with that perspective, the main goal of the story is to spread awareness of the increase, and share information on how people can locate and sign up for assistance in their own communities (with SNAP and other programs).

If anyone is willing to share their thoughts with me, please reach out to me here or directly via email: john@nextadvisor.com.",moneywrites,1631046378.0,foodstamps

Timeline

*Renewal due on Nov 30, 2020

*I sent renewal on Nov 22, 2020

*I sent documents on Nov 23, 2020

I did not receive any notices or any request for
 any other documents.  Not by mail, not by
 email.

My food benefits are deposited on the 3rd of every month. 
* December 3rd, they were not deposited? 


I called 211Texas, after being on hold for 59 minutes, ( on a pre paid  limited minutes phone)
The person I spoke to said, they didnt get deposited because I have to do an interview,
which is scheduled for Dec 8. 


At the end of July, after weeks of fighting to reinstate my benefits that had been wrongfully suspended in May, HHS agreed that the suspension was an error. But I had to go through the application process anyways, after completing that, and having an interview, my benafits were reinstated, but for only half the amount I had been getting. 
Just grateful for anything.
* Done *


August I moved into a apartment after being homeless, so I had to submit a change. 
I submitted the change, then I had to send lease, bills, income. Hit several bumps in the road, but completed that.
* Done *


November received a notice to renew my Snap and then another notice to renew my Medicaid.
Completed that on Nov 23, but now again bumps in the road.  I dont understand why I would need to renew Snap at this time anyways?
I did the application and interview just 3 months ago, sent all required information.  Then again 2 months ago when reported the move, and update on the new living expenses, sent everything then as well. 


Now, no benefits for December, I will never get back on my feet with these problems with HHS, that result in disconnected utilities, late fees, reconnection fees, or hungry kids. 

Can someone please tell me what if anything I can do? Its only Dec 6, and Im already having to use money that is supposed to  be used on our electric bill on food, so by the next deposit day Jan 3, ( if theres no other problems after doing an interview), I will for sure be behind on rent, and have lost utilities.

j53uuq,[CA] Need advice re how to come clean - accidentally committed fraud,"Hi Reddit, I recently discovered that I have accidentally committed fraud by not reporting income and have been pretty stressed. I do intend to ""turn myself in"" and try to come clean but am wondering what's the best way to approach this.

A little background: my spouse worked a minimum wage job in the food industry (no tip position) and her hours varied every week, anywhere from 15-25 hours. I am a contract worker so it's always a famine or feast situation, and needless to say my income fluctuates a lot.

2019 was a very dry year for me, and I only worked a total of 2 months by the time my spouse and I applied for CalFresh for the first time in November 2019. I just took a look at our original application and we put $8K for her yearly income, and $15K for my yearly income. Both numbers were estimates based on our situation at the time.

I am not exactly sure how/why it happened this way but our application was under my spouse's name with her as the main contact. She was the one who got interviewed on the phone and got approved, etc, but I am actually the one handling finance in our household. So here comes the problem - I knew nothing about the program and didn't bother to look into our responsibilities... Soon after we were approved, I actually got another job which lasted till mid December. My spouse's situation stayed the same. The idea of reporting change of income never even crossed our mind.

Fast forward to 2020, my spouse's situation is still more or less the same but I again worked a contract job from Feb to April (did not report), and lost the job due to COVID before I went on unemployment in early April (also did not report).

We received a recertification letter recently and that's when I realized that I should have 1) reported my UI benefit and 2) reported change of income while I had my contract jobs (my income was $0 when we applied for CalFresh). Our 2019 tax filing shows $31K gross income, which is $8K more than the estimate we put in our original application. We obviously are not wealthy and had zero intention to cheat the system but am not sure if they'll believe us.

Our phone interview is scheduled for 2PM on Thursday and I want to be on the phone as well so I can explain the situation as it was only me who had a change of income significant enough to affect our eligibility.

Where do I even start? UI because they certainly see that in their system? What do I even say about my contract jobs and reasons for not reporting them months ago? We stopped using our EBT card immediately after this realization and will fully cooperate to pay back anything we owe. I just don't want this to become a legal/criminal matter and have it on my record.

Last question - we do not want to be considered for renewal. We actually decided to move abroad after the holidays (lots of self reflection during Covid). How do I withdrawal/request for our case to be terminated?

Thank you very much.",hideinshameuser,1601836225.0,foodstamps

In a nutshell summed up - grants for smaller companies / retailers to help bring them on board with online SNAP. I REALLY REALLY hope this goes on to include things like CSA's / online ordering from local vendors. 

But they also offer this tantalizing clue - 

>USDA is currently developing a [pilot program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/mobile-payment-pilot) to allow SNAP consumers to use their phones to purchase groceries at the checkout counter and will soon seek states to participate in this pilot.

&#x200B;

So it sounds like the ability to use SNAP via a saved card with things like scan & go WITHOUT having the physical card present to swipe. I'm not sure how I feel about this - on one hand it seems like it would free up a LOT of time in store for a lot of folks via the use of scan & go to see as they go along totals etc. But it also seems like a huge risk for fraud.

Ok so I was really stupid for not looking into the rules of EBT. I asked a friend on the phone and they said yes I could use in another state so I didn‚Äôt bother to look further into it. I know I was very wrong there. 

Back in April I received a call from super nice woman in fraud investigation informing me my account was flagged and in a perfect world I would‚Äôve notified her. I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure when I was coming back since everything was moment to moment with me even being out there in the first place aka unplanned af. 

In an emotionless world based solely off facts and rules, I can understand how she had little patience for me and assumed I intentionally committed fraud. 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering now how the investigation process goes and what to expect from here? Will anything be sent to the address of my family friend? Am I eligible for EBT in the state I‚Äôm in now with a CA drivers license? ‚Äî out of state DL was part of the reason I didn‚Äôt apply for one out here. I wasn‚Äôt sure how the process worked with out of state DL and couldn‚Äôt get ahold of anyone at local EBT office without giving my personal info out and I didn‚Äôt want to be flagged for fraud by asking about out of state stuff.

o74vhj,New Report: Barriers to Eating Healthy on SNAP,"A new United States Department of Agriculture (UDSA) study identifies the barriers that SNAP participants face when trying to achieve a healthy diet through a nationally representative survey of SNAP participants. The study is available [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/barriers-constrain-adequacy-snap-allotments) but I'm including the top level talking points:

1. Overall, 88 percent of SNAP participants
reported facing some type of barrier to
achieving a healthy diet throughout the month. 

2. The most common barrier overall, reported by
61 percent of SNAP participants, was the
affordability of foods that are part of a healthy
diet.

3. Other environmental barriers, reported by
nearly 20 percent of participants, were lack of
transportation to a grocery store or the distance to
a grocery store. 

4. The most common individual or household barrier,
reported by 30 percent of participants, was lack of
time to prepare meals from scratch that are part of a healthy diet

5. The prevalence of most barriers did not vary
by household composition, income sources,
education level, urbanicity, or region.

6. Two barriers ‚Äì affordability and lack of
cooking equipment or storage ‚Äì were
associated with household food insecurity.
Participants facing an affordability barrier were
2.3 times more likely to experience low or very
low household food security. Participants
reporting lack of equipment or storage were 1.6
times more likely to experience low or very low
household food security",thesongofstorms,1624553432.0,foodstamps

12sbpuc,Sudden decrease in benefit amount again?,"Hello, so last month I made a post asking about why my benefits could've decreased without warning. Our base amount used to be 380 without the emergency allotment. We renewed with the Sar7, our gross income was the same (1900 a month and rent is 1875) but our benefits dropped all the way to 180 a month.

But this month we got 250 in benefits, our amount on the account still said we'd be getting 180 a month but now it's dropped down to 95 dollars a month with NO warning or updates as to why? I would think it's the emergency allotment but that's never actually be on our account as the monthly amount each monthly benefit amount.

What the hell is going on here? Nothing's changed in terms of employment, gross income, or medical expenses compared to when we applied and renewed. So why does our benefit amount keep dropping?  


Edit: Wanted to give an update for this. Never really got answer/response when on the phone about this situation and didn't have time to go in person but we got our benefits this month on the 8th and it was 250 which was the amount we got last month and the amount that was stated to be what we'd be getting.

They had initially said they could only pay 64% of February's food stamps benefit obligations should the shutdown continue into February. 

""The agency initially guaranteed funding for the program, which serves more than 38 million people, only until the end of January if the partial government shutdown isn't resolved sooner.

The department says it is now using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse, and is working with states to issue February's food stamp benefits -- which are expected to total $4.8 billion -- by January 20.""

16qh4ax,"""Can I Have Your Card and Pin Number?""","I just did curbside pickup for the first time with a store I had  not used for curbside before. I had created an online account for rewards and had a $10 off coupon for using curbside. So last night I placed the order for pickup this afternoon. The website said they took EBT for online orders. Got to the checkout page and had two options: pay with debit or credit card, or pay IN STORE with EBT. I got some amazing deals so I decided to go through with it and see how it played out. I selected ""pay with EBT"" and then placed the order.

The website says I have to go in to pay, the app let me check in and said someone would come out. So I park in a designated spot and call the number on the sign. I wait about 10 minutes to get transferred to the right people, and explain this is the first time I have done this, I need to pay with EBT, do I come in somewhere? The lady says no I can do it over the phone, then asks me for my card AND PIN NUMBER. I tell her I'm okay with doing the card number over the phone but not so much the pin. And as I'm saying this I feel guilty like I'm accusing her of possible wrongdoing but for obvious reasons this just feels wrong. I ask if there is somewhere I can come in and do the transaction myself. She says no. So I give her the card and pin number (and changed the pin the second I got home). She says this is how they do it, and they write down the card and pin and after they use it they throw away the piece of paper ""in multiple trash cans."" Sounds like a safe system, right? What could possibly go wrong?

To top it off, as I'm waiting for my order after getting off the phone from giving the girl my card and pin number, I log into the EBT website and see the charge is $13  (approximately) more than what the online total was on my receipt. So when the order comes out, I ask the girl and she looks at me and says ""I don't know, I just work here."" A second girl (the one I apparently talked to on the phone who took my info) comes over and says ""you're the second person this has happened to. I don't know why it's doing that. Call tomorrow and talk to our manager and he will take care of it for you."" So I appreciate their honesty and after looking over the receipt and the order again I feel the receipt is right and the problem was somewhere with the website because some of the prices didn't make sense and I thought it should have been more and I figured that part out.

But what would you do about the whole ""give us your card and pin number"" over the phone situation? This is a major grocery store chain, not a little mom and pop operation. And so it can't just be there store that does this like this.

16kdzb9,CalFresh and federal shutdown,"If you're not a ""keeping up with the news"" sort of person, you may be unaware that Congress is currently fighting over next year's budget. The federal fiscal year starts October 1 - so Congress needs to agree on a budget (and Biden needs to sign it) before then, or different parts of the federal government stop working or making payments. 

The CA Dept of Social Services has announced that if Congress has not reached agreement on or before September 20, they intend to issue October's benefits a few days early to make sure they will be distributed without disruption due to the federal situation. They have requested permission from US Dept of Agriculture to make this early distribution but have not received a response yet. 

The letter is here:

https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Additional-Resources/Letters-and-Notices/ACWDL/2023/CL_9-15-23.pdf?ver=2023-09-15-141520-273

TLDR: The plan is to issue all October continuing benefits on September 28 and 29. People will get their benefits early, but will not receive another benefit load until November. If the budget situation is not resolved in October it is not clear that $ will be available to fund benefits for November. 

Please keep in mind that this is a contingency plan, not something that's guaranteed to happen. Congress seems to play ""chicken"" with the budget every year and people getting freaked out seems to be part of the game. CDSS hasn't directed counties to make announcements to clients yet; but they've posted this on their public website, so it's not really a secret, either. 

Other states are likely working on the same problem, it's a federal issue that will impact all states.",399ddf95,1694887703.0,foodstamps

We just received a letter from the state this morning indicating that ""due to the large number of cards that have been potentially compromised, a decision was made to reissue new cards to recipients whose cards were potentially compromised."" This was done WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION to the recipients affected. Those affected will have absolutely no access to their benefits until a new card is received and activated. We have no way to tell who was affected by this at the county level unless you call to find out why your card isn't working. The EBT call center is just as limited on this information as we are.

So, please check your card to ensure it is active before attempting to use it. If you find that you were affected by this, your new card should arrive within 3 to 7 business days.

15jssnv,"Had food stamps canceled over ""not turning in proof"" When I did.","I'm SO MAD. I walked 1.8 miles in 90 degree weather to turn in those damn forms and it looks like they just ignored them or managed to lose them. I was stupid and instead of getting a receipt like I normally do I put them in this white box designated for form return roughly a week ago because I trusted they couldn't possibly lose them.

Well yesterday I got a letter saying my stamps weren't being continued BECAUSE I DIDN'T TURN IN PROOF -_- I can't call the location I turned the papers into directly for some stupid reason so now it looks like I have to walk 1.8 miles. I don't get how you lose papers from a box you have to take papers from only a few feet away from where you process them. How could I possibly prove I turned them in now?

Update: well I called and after being put on hold for literally 3 hours I was told my documents were there but hadn't been processed then the guy tried to give me some bs about how I didn't include enough pay stubs in the form my boss filled out when I KNOW it did so I ended up getting extremely upset and hanging up because despite having all my information right there he's also acting confused about what interval I get paid when on the stupid form it CLEARLY STATES I get paid EVERY TWO weeks. So after hanging up I had to make yet another 1.8 mile walk to the food stamp office and they told me basically my forms were still being processed because they're backed up which is understandable but I wish I had at least been informed of that instead of just being sent a letter my food stamps were being cancelled because I didn't submit proof when I know I did and now come to find out they know I did too. It just makes me so upset because I truly depend on these benefits right now.

I checked my card just now and there was another unexpected deposit of $250, almost the same amount I got on the first on top of the $50 I was trying to save for the rest of the month. 

So this month SNAP has paid me what I think is the new monthly benefit twice? 

I don't know if it's legal for me to spend these EBT benefits or not. Did EBT or my state just decide to pay us twice a month now? Are we getting emergency benefits or a bonus I'm not aware of?

I was reciving requests from SNAP well after a month that I had applied, but that I needed to verify some things. By the time I recovered at home to start looking up my bills and see if unemployment had payed me anything yet etc I saw their request in the mail. So I missed their deadline for 5 days.

Now their original request said :

Information/Action Required
Expenses are greater than income. 
Please provide information as to how you 
are paying your bills. 

Acceptable Verification/Proof
You must provide verification of how you are meeting your expenses or proof your expenses are not paid

So I talked to a rep after that, I sent them my missed mortgage house payments, the mortgage is 1141 of the missed payments, but I wrote 1400 in ""shelter costs"" since I was including HOA.

That page says ""Costs that lower your income"" (deductions) 
Cost 1,400.     Deduction. 586

They sent me a new letter saying:

Expenses are greater than income.
Please provide information as to how you are paying your bills. Provide verification of your mortgage payment. 

What changed was the amount in their ""Costs that lower your income""(deductions)

It says now, Shelter 360, deduction 360.

So it seems like they adjusted my shelter costs and now they want to see how the remaining 360 are paid?
Or they want to know how did I afford to pay stuff if my expenses were greater than income?

I thought of sending them the statement where it shows unemployment was paying in December but then they stopped in December, so I then applied to SNAP because I was unsure if I was going to get unemployment back.


What should I do and not do? I am having a very slow recovery from covid, I don't have the energy to be dealing with all the extra stress. I really need the help. Unemployment has paid whenever they want to then stop paying again. 

I am not sure if what I posted make sense. I am just hoping to get advice from people that was in the same situation and how they resolved it.

l1c6qq,(NYC/general): SNAP budgeting/food insecurity master's thesis research,"Hello!

I'm a journalism master's student compiling a thesis on SNAP/P-EBT/EBT in the context of food insecurity in New York City. I'm looking to speak with anyone who has used the program at any point over the past couple of years (ideally I'll speak with people who used it prior to COVID and those who applied after COVID's arrival). I'd love to hear from anyone with intimate experience with the program or knowledge of its operations. I'm looking to better understand the everyday decisions (how accessible is the program, how households choose to use it, do households still look to charitable programs like food banks etc.)

If this is something you're willing to discuss, please reach me by DM and I'll take you through more specifics. Right now, I just want to put the call out there to get a better survey of people's experience with the program.

I do want to emphasize something, so apologies for the length: Food insecurity is not synonymous with poverty nor is poverty synonymous with food insecurity. One of the most destructive narratives that has emerged since the pandemic is that food insecurity is some kind of new phenomenon in the U.S.  I believe too many stories are written about the mere existence of these realities as if they haven't existed before (this speaks to a broader issue about how media organizations are built and how they cover communities unfamiliar to them). 

What is important to me is how people are adapting in these increasingly challenging times and what role government assistance plays in that. If I can promise you anything, it is that I will listen carefully about your experience with the SNAP program and how it factors into your everyday life.

If this interests you, please DM me. I think it's important that the public is better aware of how the SNAP and (P)-EBT programs are designed and how individuals interact with them.

fxnzbe,"Phone interview scheduled today, received no call but marked denied for not keeping appt???","I applied for SNAP benefits in Georgia maybe 2 weeks ago, since I have been unable to work due to the zombie apocal- I mean, COVID-19 outbreak. I haven‚Äôt gotten any mail correspondence, but I got a call from the automated system the day before yesterday saying my appointment was at 9:30am on 4/8. I set my alarm for 9 so I‚Äôd be alert when the case worker called, but no call came through (I was connected to WiFi with a super strong connection and my phone isn‚Äôt set to silence unknown callers, I confirmed). At 9:45 there was still no call so I called the automated line and the app status was ‚Äúdenied due to not keeping interview appointment‚Äù....what?!!!! I‚Äôve literally been watching my phone, waiting for it to ring...there are NO missed calls, what in the world??????  I called back and (by nothing short of a miracle) someone called right back! She said the CW will call within the hour, that my case was NOT denied, and that she emailed the CW let her kno I was still waiting for her call. She assured me the CW will definitely call by 6. Of course I never got a call,  and my App status is still saying ‚Äúdenied for missed appt‚Äù on the automated line. I requested several calls back and never received one again, I requested my appointment be rescheduled, the automated system said I‚Äôd get a call back that I never got. I actually read an article that a year or two ago, caseworkers in Georgia had been accused of denying applicants after falsifying documents, saying the applicant didn‚Äôt answer the phone, so they would not have to process the application. I‚Äôm positive they are overwhelmed because of our current state, but this is literally what my fear is happening to me. 

I kno it‚Äôs a lot to read, and my apologies, I just wanted to be thorough. But if there‚Äôs anyone, maybe an existing case worker or someone who has a similar situation they‚Äôve successfully resolved, can anyone offer any insight?? I haven‚Äôt worked in 3 weeks, we are VERY low on food, and I‚Äôm panicking üò•

UPDATE! Ok so, they really never called me back. But I got up at the buttcrack of dawn to hope that if I called the automated line early I may get a call back this time. It worked again! I got a very nice lady who told me she wasn‚Äôt sure why the application was denied and that she doesn‚Äôt want to assume anything, but she escalated my case and said do not worry - we are in this together! You‚Äôll get a call back to reschedule as soon as this request is process, just relax and wait for the call. She also gave me CW info that I didn‚Äôt get before. I hung up with her and the CW called within 30 seconds! He literally asked me 1 question then said my card is in the mail and in 20 min my case status will be updated. So I think my issue is resolved ü§ûüèΩAnyone else that is having a similar issue, call the contact number first thing in the am! When I called at 8-9am, I got an immediate call back...there is an option to reschedule your appt, select it and they will verify your number.

faia26,How to get case re-opened,"My case has been closed for about 3 weeks after a renewal. After 3 weeks of constant friendly contact with my local DFACS (GA) my benefits have been reinstated. I wanted to share how. 

1. Upload AND hand deliver requested documents in a timely manner.
2. Make sure you get receipt via screen shot for uploaded documents and a receipt for hand deliveries. 
3. Always remain polite and pleasant, we are all humans and they have difficulties in life as well. You will brighten their day with your optimism.
4. Call and leave a message to your caseworker often. If they haven't contacted you in a few days, call their supervisor. These are need based programs and many people apply so keep contacting them. 
5. Go to the office  or call and confirm that the caseworker is available and see if the receptionist can set up an appointment for you to speak with your caseworker.
6. If you haven't received any letter or phone call, contact the supervisor of the supervisor of your caseworker to let her know what's going on. 
7. I know it can be frustrating because we apply for these benefits because we are in need, but remain polite, friendly and always have proof for any income you receive, so as to not have any delay in benefits.
8. Many times in my area caseworkers make mistakes and close cases, look over your paperwork for any inconsistencies and try to self-edit. If your caseworker states any untrue info regarding what you sent in or that they didn't receive it, kindly inform them of the receipts. Hopefully your case will be re-opened and you get the benefits your family needs Good luck!",becomingjubilant,1582835065.0,foodstamps
cgm74d,Just approved for CalFresh - I have some questions about using the EBT card...,"I just got approved for CalFresh (California version of SNAP) and am now waiting on my EBT card in the mail.  I have a few questions... they seem really dumb and obvious, but I've been searching around the Calfresh site and the wiki here and am finding no answers.  Forgive me if they're common questions, maybe my search-engine skills are especially bad today.

1. I know I can only buy food and even then there are restrictions (no eaten-in-the-store type foods, etc.) and the person doing my interview said ""it just won't work if you try to buy toilet paper or something with it.""  Ok.  What happens at the check-out of the grocery store if I accidentally have an item that isn't covered?  Does the whole payment get rejected and I have to use an alternative payment for everything?  Or does it notify the check-out person that the amount of the non-food item has to be paid for another way while putting the allowed items on the EBT?  Something else?

2.  Similar to the last question... if I'm close to using up my monthly balance, and accidentally get a few items that put me over that balance, does it reject the whole thing, or inform me and the checkout person that I have to pay for the rest with another method?  Something else?

3. I'm guessing the answer to this must be yes, but does the check-out person at the grocery store see that I'm paying with Calfresh/foodstamps?  I kind of know some of the checkout people at the store I usually go to and I know it shouldn't matter, but I'd rather they didn't know I am on foodstamps. 

4. I'm guessing the answer to this must be no, but if I don't use a lot of my balance one month, does any of that remaining amount ""roll over"" to the next month?  I assume it entirely resets to the given balance each month, I'd be very surprised if it were anything else, but I'd like to know for sure.

16s4q8p,SNAP benefits reduced by more than half,"Ever since my husband passed away and I lost my job (2 months after his passing) last year, I decided to apply for California SNAP Benefits and Medi-Cal. I have never applied for any of these program before and therefore don't know how they work.  I was granted both. My SNAP monthly benefit amount was $740 and it had remained the same until I had to recertification last week- it dropped significantly to $256 for a 3 person household. Nothing has changed except that I started receiving monthly death benefits from my late husband's pension plan in the amount of $1170, plus a monthly $942 from SSA for Survivor Benefits. Obviously, they take into account what I pay for mortgage and utilities. 2 family members live in my house and help me pay for my mortgage, otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford it. But when verifying they asked me if I charge them rent or if they help me pay for my mortgage... to me it's all the same since I use their money towards my mortgage. But,  apparently it has to do with how they account for that money. For example, if I charge them rent that money now goes towards my income. However, if they help me pay the mortgage that money is deducted from my expenses and not counted as income. Also, when I went into the office the rep mentioned something that i still couldn't wrap my head around; she said that to receive SNAP and Medi-Cal, it doesn't matter what i have in the bank or what property I own, that they solely go by the earned income (from a job). Does this hold any truth? Either way, I still didn't understand the logic behind any of what I just mentioned but I just know that my benefits were reduced significantly. Does anyone has any insight on any of this? TIA for any and all input.",avy_123,1695677737.0,foodstamps
16eci2o,Don't use Walmart website or app to place an order.,"So I got my snap benefits of $280 the 6th after struggling for weeks to be able to afford food and the morning they came in I placed an order on the Walmart app to have it delivered at my apartment like I usually do because I don't own a car. The order came (which was about $40) and on 8th I tried to make another purchase but it got declined. After checking my older purchases online I saw that after immediately after I placed my Walmart order, a charge for $220 was posted on my account from a Walmart in Florida. I live in Arizona by the way so it obviously wasn't me, someone must have hacked the Walmart website and stole my card information and used up nearly all my benefits.

We desperately needed some groceries and prescriptions, so we decided this would be the last time we drive till I get paid to get tags and use what we had for the food and scripts.

Saw a text when we got home that our bank was -$20. What?!? The snap had not gone through. It's not even showing up on my receipt. If you have more food items than snap money, does it deny the whole snap card? Why doesn't it pay the amount left on the card if that's the case?

My electric bill is in my ex fianc√©s name because i don‚Äôt have the money to put down a security deposit ($432) I have renewed my benefits about 3-4 times since he moved out with his name still on the electricity bill. This month they denied me of food stamps and LIHEAP because his name was on the electricity bill. So I had to send in a renewed lease proving that he wasn‚Äôt living with me. My old lease didn‚Äôt have his name on it from Oct 2021 and  it ended in Oct 2022. No biggie.

I just got a call from the county assistance office (a fill in from my actual case worker) She questioned me as to why my paychecks only state that i make $500. I told her that I‚Äôm a waitress and that‚Äôs what it shows that i make. I don‚Äôt have another way to prove my income.

zadovq,EBT card cancelled without my knowledge ?,"Hello, I live in California and something weird happened in regards to my EBT card. Earlier this morning, I was able to use my card normally, but I tried to use it tonight and the terminal that I used said my card was declined. Due to this, I contacted the number on the back of my card and entered my card number. I got an automated response asking if I had reported my card lost, stolen, or destroyed and said no. The response I had gotten back said that the card is not working due to the card being canceled which is strange because I never called to cancel it.

I then proceeded to speak with a CALFRESH representative through the helpline and they said that the account is still active and has a balance, along with everything being correct on their end with no issues. They told me to contact the county office tomorrow and get another card issued to me.

Has this ever happened to anyone else ? I find it weird that a card can just be canceled randomly without notice if everything is correct and active. I'm also afraid that maybe someone has my card number and was the one to cancel it, but that doesn't really make sense to me either.

I began receiving SNAP (CalFresh) benefits this month. I wanted to make this post just to say I am so extremely grateful for this program.

I recently lost my job and got into a car accident shortly after. Living on what savings I have has been stressful. Thankfully, with SNAP, I feel more food-secure and, for the first time in a while, have been able to confidentially stock my kitchen with food. I initially felt embarrassed by the idea and after I finally qualified I wish I would have done it sooner.

Compared to working on my disability claim and unemployment with the EDD, getting CalFresh was a breeze. Their online application system is simple, intuitive and quick. My case worker is pleasant and I didn't feel judged for applying.

For those of you feeling hesitant about the idea, go for it! It doesn't hurt to apply! I also had no idea I could use my card at Whole Foods. And, no more .10 bag fee!

rmngq4,"[Florida] Food Stamps Nightmare, Unjust/Unfair Sanction and Denial!","I have been fighting for two months to only be denied. It started with a letter that was sent to my old address, I had missed an interview for orientation at the workforce center. First, I am both homeless and disabled have been since my husband died during COVID. I received a good cause notice and couldn't get through on the phone for week and a half, so I Faxed a letter stating the good cause 9 days before it was due and submitted it online, so they received it. Then I submitted a change request to update my address and employment status  a whole part time at 150 a week (before Tax) all I have found in 5 month of submitting my resume and applications. 

The site notified me I needed to recertify so I did that too. My account changes to Technical Verification then I started receiving notices. They wanted employment verification I spent weeks trying to get through on the phone and submitted the form my employer filled out. I just started the job, so at the time I had only one pay stub because I get paid Bi-monthly and Submitted that. I got through to them 3 times in a month in a half. All the while the reps telling me ""I see you submitted everything on time your account looks fine"" and ""you should be sanctioned I noted your homeless. 

My address also reverted back to my old one during the month, so I submitted another change.

During last month I missed a phone call for the phone interview because I was working. I called back every day for a week and she never returned my calls. The 3rd and last time I got through the rep said she could complete my phone interview. I affirmed the homeless situation and disabilities during the interview and asked it to be noted because of the pending sanction. ""Everything looks fine"" she says. I would like to note that all my applications state that I am homeless, as well. The day before I get my deposit they send me a letter DENIED Dec and Jan. My original application ended in Dec now suddenly it ends in Jan. Of course, the deposit date has passed so I can forget getting anything this month.

The reason (UNBELEAVBLE!):  YOU ARE RECEIVING THE SAME TYPE OF ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM NO HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM You did not complete the work requirements listed below for the Food Assistance Program - first non-compliance. WE DID NOT RECEIVE PROOF OF EARNED INCOME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILTY 

I called again, took all day to get the call back. That agent told me it because I didn't submit proof of income for October. I said that is because I don't have proof it was a $280 cash transfer for contract services. I have no pay stubs or any way to prove it, she tells me to write a letter and sign it and submit it online. That my account needs to be triggered for reevaluation. She tells me I have to call again and submit a request and of course can't get through.

BUT what she is telling me doesn't coincide with the denial letter. I feel like they are screwing people intentionally! Like they must be out of money. I have never had these problems before. 

What did I do wrong? I don't honestly know what to do! I have done everything asked of me. I have been unfairly sanctioned and denied. Will the local legislation office help if I contacted them? They got my unemployment fixed fast. Please does anyone know who I can contact or what I can do?

I'll try to sum this up as best as possible 

Lost my job with Pandemic. Applied and was approved for $186/month. A month later I received a letter stating because of the unemployment $600 bonus I now only qualified for $16. So they said for the first month I how have to pay back the difference. 

It was a joke so I just stopped using it and figured they'd just use the balance I had to cover that. 

A month later I receive a letter saying I still need to pay so I called and spoke to my case worker and she they can't do that and I have to fill out a form to indicate I'm asking for my balance to cover that ""back pay"" 

So I did. This was last year in June  

Today I received a letter saying now my case is delinquent/collections for $179. 

I no longer have EBT because it said it would expire and I had to reapply so I didn't since $16 wasn't enough and I'd rather leave that to someone else. 

**Does this mean that balance I left purposely now vanished??**

Thousands of Alaskans who depend on government assistance have waited months for food stamp benefits, exacerbating a long-standing hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic, inflation and the remnants of a typhoon that wiped out stockpiles of fish and fishing equipment.

The backlog, which began last August, is especially concerning in a state where communities in far-flung areas, including Alaska Native villages, are often not connected by roads. They must have food shipped in by barge or airplane, making the cost of even basic goods exorbitant. Around 13% of the state's roughly 735,000 residents received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits ‚Äî or SNAP ‚Äî in July, before the troubles began.

That was false. We got married at the end of 2018 and shortly after I removed myself from the marriage because we had problems. I went to stay with my mom for almost 2 weeks. He told me to come back to the home and he will go to his parents who live on the same property not even 20 ft from the home we have. We had an agreement that he would pay the mortgage and light bill as a ‚Äúchild support payment‚Äù in the beginning of 2019. Both homes had the same address, 1 mailbox for both. In 2020 I finally got a unit number for the home and my own mailbox; at this time it had already been 1 year and half at his mothers home. Anything the kids needed he would get he wasn‚Äôt supporting me any kind of way other than paying the rent and foodstamps new this and verified. In late 2020 he filed for a divorce and updated his mailing address to my unit because he wanted the papers to go to my mailbox. We co parented very well. Mid 2021 we had started talking back up again because during the divorce process he wasn‚Äôt sure if that was what he really wanted. We were both talking to other people at this time.

yd8ga9,[NY] Denied benefits at rectification because it was alleged that I have business that I have no knowledge of or participation in.,"Hi all.

Here's a doozy. I was denied SNAP benefits at my latest re-certification because it was alleged that I have a business that I do not own, didn't start and do not participate in.

I asked in a letter/fax where this information came from and to please furnish me with a copy. It took them 3 weeks to send me an except from a LexisNexis Accurint report that lists a business that started in 2020 at the address I reside at. It doesn't attach the business to me/my name, only to my address. The worker who sent it tried to redact a portion of it but when held up to the light, says that there were no filings associated with this business.

Again, I have no knowledge of this business of any kind.

I sent a notarized letter attesting to the fact that I do not have any interest, ownership, participation or knowledge in this business. I even sent my own personal LexisNexus report that does not list any business of any kind.

My taxes from 2020 and 2021 that I sent also do not have any business of that kind on it. Just my landscaping and scrap metal oddjobs. My bank statements of a full year that I sent also do not in any way reflect that business in question.

Here's the kicker: the worker said that I have this business which she believes is an internet businessand that many people started internet businesses during the pandemic. She then asks for proof that the business is defunct. This is an illogical and impossible request since it would be asking me to prove a negative.

I asked for a supervisor and sent a letter asking for a supervisor to intervene. Never heard anything back. Also asked for an agency conference but never heard back and when I called and spoke to a live person they said they wouldn't grant one but that I should request a hearing instead. So I requested a fair hearing.

I live with another adult family member but have always stated factually that I buy and prepare my own meals.

I believe this started because the case worker on this latest recertification may have noticed at the time that I had over $1000 in benefits left. But that surplus has been there for more than a year but I have been exhausting most of each monthly benefit and that balance stayed more or less the same for almost a year. Thanks to the extra pandemic benefit of $95.

When I reapplied with a new application recently while waiting for my fair hearing, this issue is coming up again. Why? This time they are asking for proof from IRS and State regarding the status of the business in question. I told them that it is impossible for me to obtain something I have no affiliation with and to please refer to my notarized statement.

What is going on?

No investigator ever called or showed up. And this issue has been going on since June. Can't see why an investigator would bother with this since no kids and no fraud is at work. And an investigator can easily look up on state register for any LLC or INC. I did, and no such business exists. If a sole proprietorship, then it would reflect in my taxes which it doesn't. So why are my consistent statements about this alleged business being ignored?

How do I possibly satisfy this issue on their part?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: 10/30/22

So on Saturday morning (10/29), I was checking to see the status of my current SNAP application online and to my surprise, it said, ""APPROVED."" 

&#x200B;

But here's the kicker: when I went to check my SNAP balance, not only did I get the prorated portion from this month (starting from day of the approved application), but also for August and September including the Pandemic $95 for each month. 

I think the person preparing the evidence packet for my Hearing on Nov 2, looked at the situation and realized the error made by the previous caseworker. 

&#x200B;

I guess my fair hearing is moot now. If I get a letter in the mail by Tuesday stating the reasoning why they decided to go back and add the 2 months for which my fair hearing is concerned, I will cancel/withdraw my hearing request. Otherwise, I will have to go forward with it and if the agency decides to withdraw (which by this action already suggests they have), I happily would agree. 

I don't know who to thank at the agency, be it my current caseworker who I had before and she was a gem, or an unnamed supervisor. So I'll just thank them all. It's a hard thankless job.

I know GROSS means total without deductions. Does this mean without even deducting self-employment expenses?

For example, on eBay last month my ""Total Sales"" were $1,012.86. But I only MADE net $508.01 which includes fees, shipping, and $193.04 that I can prove I bought items for with receipts that I then sold over time.

$1400 to $1700 a month

With that income a family of 3 should quality for food stamps in Texas.

 I worry we won't qualify for a couple reasons and If anyone has advice for me I would majorly appreciate it. I'm new to food stamps.

Reason one) 
 We have two vehicles we own
One we bought for $7500 and the other was $4500
We were given money from my husband's grandma and used our stimulus checks to purchase them.
Before we had two old flooded from hurricane Imelda cars that we traded out for the better ones.

Reason two)
With my husband's job that he's about to step down from we've been able to save back $3500 and I'm scared having that much in savings and the cars would disqualify us and it would totally be understandable.

I figure if we get disqualified we could live partly off of our savings until it's gone then I can apply again.

Also our son is Autistic and I tried to get social security disability back in 2019 right before covid started and even with our old flooded out cars and nothing in savings we didn't qualify.

ezlpn0,Question about counted income?,"My mom and brother got denied snap. The denial letter says that counted income is double what she actually gets a month.

ex1l6i,Obtuse & inane overpayment collections... CA,"So, out of the blue, I get an overpayment letter claiming I need to pay back $388. I've moved counties, and have had various problems as a result, so I assume it has to do with that (note, you're not supposed to have to re-apply when you change counties mid-certification period, as I did, your case should just be transferred over). The notice has documentation that is supposed to ""explain"" why the collection is happening, but it makes 0 sense!   Every field is either 0 or left blank except for the field about the benefits I received. For example, all the income fields say I actually made $0, ok well I didn't make $0 but I did make under the income limit, and if I had made $0 as they claim then why the fuck would that mean that I was overpaid benefits and that I should be receiving $0 in benefits?! That makes no sense! Also it says that there are 0 people in my household. Obviously that is not the case, there is 1 person in my household, me. How can you even have a case/household with 0 people in it?? Lol... (here's the documents so you know what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/5BVRXE9) and the number they provide for scheduling a hearing/requesting an appeal is not even in service..  I'm disabled and was registered as such in my old county yet here I keep getting warnings about being able bodied and I've sent multiple emails and requests to call to my worker with no response. I've included all my paperwork and proof that I'm disabled in those emails. I don't know if because she still hasn't processed that I'm disabled I'm getting these, but the warning letters I got still indicated I was at least eligible for benefits for the months they are now trying to collect on. 

Edit:

here's what I got from the county ombudsman after a lot of back and forth:

The supervisor of the worker assigned your case just contacted me. The reason there are zeroes on the budget lines of the notice of action and the reason you have an overissuance of CalFresh in C County is because, according to the statewide system, you are active CalFresh in A County. According to the supervisor, A County should have discontinued your CalFresh 11/30/19 but they did not. CalFresh in A County needs to be discontinued before you will be eligible for CalFresh in C County.

So then I say:

Why did I get this (attached official notice of county transfer on like 11/20)? I reported my change when I moved using the official forms, and I know that they were slow to transfer it over for some weird reason, but I kept mentioning it to them every time I talked to them and they kept saying they would do it. And also what am I supposed to do about this overpayment claim? Where is the overpayment? If my case is still in A, despite all evidence to the contrary, why does that mean I was overpaid? I haven't gotten additional food stamps to my knowledge, at least that I can access, nor do I have the money to pay the claim, hence being on food stamps. This still explains nothing about the overpayment collection claims. What are the next steps I can take?

and she says:

If the statewide MEDS system is correct as EHSD is assuming it to be, you collected money on A County EBT card for December and January. As of today, you are listed as active CalFresh in A County. Your next step is to contact A County worker. If there was money put on your EBT card for that County, then it is unspent and that is what you can use to pay back C County. Priority is to get your A County case closed or transferred and in so doing, determine what money was paid to you for CalFresh for December and January as you will need to pay back C County. Once A County case is officially closed/transferred, you can reapply for CalFresh in C. You were denied CF in C because you have an open case in A County

and so then I say:

Ok well it wasn't overpaid there and I've also done everything in my power to get my case transferred over here. Like I said I filled out the paper work and then talked to them on top of it many times about changing counties and have gotten acknowledgement that they will transfer my case. Obviously my Medicaid case transferred over, so I don't know why it's claiming this hasn't. I've done my due diligence on this and I literally don't know what else I can do. I'm not a calfresh employee. I can't go into the system and fix whatever the problem seems to be. I've already called and emailed them about this issue like I said and all I've gotten is acknowledgements they they will or have transfered my case... Like I said the paper work I got said it was transferred over here anyway. I haven't seen any double payments to my card. So what am I supposed to do about this threatening letter from C threatening collections? If I was overpaid by A county (which there's no evidence of overpayment from any county, but for the sake of clarity), then why would I have to pay back C county? I do live in C, so even if there was a double payment (which there's not) if anything, A would collect, not C. And no one has given me any proof that there was actual over payment.

So again, what am I supposed to do about this collections letter? Can it be thrown out or do I have to appeal? Are you saying to just ignore it until we get the whole which county is handling my case thing sorted out at least?

And also it's illegal to make me reapply for benefits just because I've moved counties. The law is as long as there's no change in income or other qualifiers I should not have to do that sort of thing till my recertification period.

----

Any practical advice, especially what to do about the collections, which she hasn't addressed at all yet, would be great. 

Despite her ""priority"" being that my old case is ""closed or transferred"", which as I say I've already done everything in my power to do, my priority is 1. being able to eat and 2. not having money stolen/being harassed due to fraudulent collections, so advice on that stuff would be great.

asp6r7,Should I cancel my SNAP and Medicaid assistance?,"After having a phone interview, I'm afraid I may be investigated for fraud since I never mentioned that my child's father is deceased. Since I'm a single Mother attending University, I have been receiving $350+ in SNAP benefits plus Medicaid for me and my child. The interview took place early in the morning so when the interviewer asked for the name of my child's father I accidently told her the name of the man I am dating. Then retracted an told her the name of my child's birth father who is now deceased. She sounded very shocked and...irritated as she repeadedly demanded to know why I wasn't recieving something called social security benefits for my child. I told her I was only interested in recieving Medicaid and SNAP. After putting me on hold for a little while, she instructed me to upload documentation regarding proof of enrollment then abruptly ended the interview. 

I just spent some time researching possible penalties and processes involving SNAP fraud investigation teams, court cases etc. As a full time student and Mom I have zero time to go through something as stressful as this. I can't imagine having to find an attorney and go through the motions of it all. I'm considering just looking for work and canceling any and all assistance from the state. It has been a rocky road dealing with false renewal notices when I already renewed and issues locating my caseworker, etc. Id rather just end it all now.

If I am accused of fraud, will cancelling all assistance prevent me from having to deal with any further issues?",oo28,1550674344.0,foodstamps

I always talk to someone in person and take about 4 months worth of pay stubs and explain to them how unstable my income is, it's never been a problem before. But since my renewal fell on November and I made an ""extra"" 200$ that month, they cut down my benefits. 

I got January and February's deposit yesterday, and knowing that it has to last until March (or possibly later), I'm really nervous about being shorted 120$. I'm pretty good with budgeting but most of the time this is literally all of my grocery money.

However, states have to opt into this program and so far, only four states participate in the program - California, Arizona, Rhode Island, and Florida.

 I been living in a homeless shelter with my fiance and my 2 kids since May 6, but we finally got approved to stay here about 1 month ago. I want to mention that im not in the worst position financially, i work a 9-5 monday-friday and have a decent savings. We never struggled with food or any essentials like diapers/clothes etc. The reason why i became homeless was because i could not find an apartment in time and the person whos house we were living at decided they wanted us to go. No bad blood there i completely get it, having 4 extra people intruding your home daily doesnt sound fun.we were told to leave, and ended up going to path in the bronx. I been applying for apartments on my own daily, and i either get no responce, or get 2 specific messages. 1. That unfortunately they are looking to rent to someone who makes 40x the monthly rent anually, and 2. That its too many people wanting to move to the apartment (4 of us to a 1 bedroom cause thats all i can afford). 

Our case worker told us that we need to pursue a housing voucher, made it seem like it was mandatory to pursue. I still do not know for sure if i have to mandatory pursue it while being in a homeless shelter, but to avoid any issues with evicting us we went ahead and followed instructions. She told us we must apply for cash assistance in order to have an open case. The goal was that wether we get denied or approved (denial was the likely scenario since i do have a savings), that it would lead to us having an open cash assitance case which is needed in order to pursue a housing voucher from ""NYCHA"" or in this case ""CITYFEPS"". The thing is now they want my fiancee whom im living with in this homeless shelter to file for child support. I provide for both my sons and my fiancee as far as my financing allows. We all have everything we need, we never go hungry, we all have propper clothing. She nor me have anything to complain about aside from our housing situation. 
I have been saving to build a security nest for when i do have an apartment im able to afford minimum 6 months of rent or more in case i lose my job or something happens were i cant work. Just for security reasons.
My fiancee is the head of household at the homeless shelter, when we first showed up to path i asked to be the head of household i was told i couldnt be. Now cash assistance is sending her applications and giving her child support appointments even after providing residency proof that we are all together at this homeless shelter.

What are my options here?Can i be put on child support even if i live with my fiancee and both our kids? is there anyway i can avoid being put on child support? My fiancee doesnt want to because it makes no sence to, we are together and we are happy and im providing for all their needs. Cash assistance was only done because our case worker told us we have to for a housing voucher. They mailed us applications for both the kids and given her an appointment they want her to go to for child support labeled ""Mandatory"". I dont know how we should proceed with this.

I got all the information turned in on time and everything was fine for a while.  We continued receiving benefits from December through April.  However, the woman I spoke to in December told me they'd mail an Interim Contact form that would be due in April and if I didn't fill it out and return it on time I'd lose my benefits.  On April 27th I remembered that conversation and realized that I hadn't seen the form in the mail, so I signed into my FSSA Benefits Portal online and saw that they'd mailed it in March and it was already past due and my benefits would end April 30th.

I called the office and the woman I spoke to asked me to confirm my DOB, address, and phone number.  It turns out that they hadn't updated my address in December and they'd sent the form to my former address.  She put me on hold while she spoke to her supervisor then told me that they had just updated my address and told me to go to the office to fill out the form.  I asked if it would be ok considering that it was already past due and she said yes, it was their mistake.  I asked if I would need to appeal their decision to cancel my benefits to ensure that I would keep my benefits while it gets sorted out.  She said no, it would get fixed.  I filled the form out the next day (April 28th) and thought everything would be ok.

Our benefits are deposited the 11th of every month.  On May 9th I checked online and nothing had changed.  It still said my SNAP ended April 30th.

129u5na,NC Clients: Income Base Period Changed,"I wanted to post about this in case it might save just one person some trouble. 

This change occurred a few months ago, but we have seen many clients provide the wrong paystubs for income verification for their recert. For over 5 years, the rule has been to provide all income for the month prior to recert. For example, recert due in April then you would turn in all income received in March. No reason to expect it to change.

Now, we are required to use all income received for the 30 days prior to the agency receiving your recert. The state did update the first page of the recert papers to say this, but the print is so small and at the bottom that many miss it. I know I would if I had been  turning in the prior month for years and years without issue. To make it somewhat more confusing, the 30 day time frame does not include the date turned in either. This new base period also applies to changes as well as applications. 

However, income base periods for odd jobs, self employment, and child support have not changed. Odd jobs and self employment are still for the prior 12 months or previous year tax return. Child support received is still the three months prior to the month the recert was due. There are more rules and situations where this could vary, but I'm not going to get into them since it's not the purpose of this post.

Some examples using the new base period:

 --App received by the agency on 4/3. We would need all income received from 3/4 to 4/2. 

--Recert received by the agency on 4/30. We would need all income received from 3/31 to 4/29.

--New job reported 5/9 to worker after you've crossed the income reporijng threshold for your household in April. We would need all income received from 4/9 to 5/8. 

Knowing this can make the difference in how quickly your recert is processed. If we have the correct paystubs and need nothing else then it can be processed asap. If we can't use half of the paystubs provided, then we have to request the ones that are missing.",panbi94,1680461225.0,foodstamps
11u9jxz,Georgia - Never has a renewal button. I end up having to submit a new application. It‚Äôs frustrating and delays benefits for the next month. Anyone else?,"Hello

I‚Äôm not trying to be a recipient I work and my husband works but it‚Äôs not enough for our family. We have had food stamps for a year and a half. Every 4 months they start a renewal process my last one was October 2022. They initiated another one February 2023. 

It says to click the renewal tab or call the 1800 number. The number is always busy and sends me through an automated system to just finally end up disconnected. The local office Cobb County, their lines always busy. And there is never a renewal tab or link on Gateway. I end up every time having to submit a new application for assistance. It takes a month from that date to even get it looked at. 

This last time I‚Äôve had to write to the senate office and call the case supervisor because the voice mail boxes of the workers are full on the letterheads. I waited over a month and it just got looked at.

11gcs2r,Access HRA app and trouble uploading documents,"I'm applying in New York and having trouble getting the Access HRA app to recognize my documentation, and was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and knows what to do.

The primary issue is all of my documents are in PDF form, but the Access HRA app only allows you to ""Take a Photo"" or ""Select a Photo."" PDFs appear to not be recognized.

Initially I assumed this just meant I needed to convert the PDFs to jpgs, which are recognized by the Access HRA app. Access HRA is able to see the .jpgs in my phone's camera folder, in my screenshot folder.... virtually, all jpgs.

But when I converted my PDFs to jpgs and saved them to those same folders, the Access HRA app still can't find them. I tried PNG files too, just to see if that changed it, but there's still no luck.

I'm 100% certain the newly made and converted files are in the correct folders. I've even tried things like moving them to the screenshots folder, where I can see the Access HRA app allows me to select from, but the app for some reason just doesn't recognize the documentation. Frustratingly, it does recognize new photos, new screenshots.

I've reset my phone several times and logged in and out of the app even more times, but this hasn't helped.

This is in California. 

I am on SSI, my husband is pending his SSI and not workin. I was getting $1140 a month and $363 for food stamps.

With COLA I now get $1251.00 as of Jan 1. That caused our food stamps to go down to 315. That sucked but okay I can handle it. 

Then, we get a notice that they've gone down to $208 because we no longer pay rent (we bought our property, but our utility costs have gone up, and we live in rural area so gas to get anywhere is more, we can't walk anywhere like in the city, going to the Dr is 160 miles round trip. For example. We pay propane water gas charcoal (no cooking facilities), phone, and medical expenses, car insurance, property taxes. 

So the only expense we no longer have is rent.  But everything else went up. 

Somehow that took our food stamps from 315 to 208.

On the benefits change notice though the income they put is the same, the deductions are the same, expenses listed is the same only difference is the amount of the food stamps.

$3500~ of the $6k will go towards tuition and the rest (i think) will go to me so that i can use it for books and additional costs of the BS program. 

do i have to report that i will be getting financial aid? do i have to have the financial aid department fill out paperwork to send to my caseworker? 

i anticipate that i will still be working and going to school full time, does that disqualify me from getting SNAP?

i want to try and get all the paperwork all ready and filled out (if necessary) before i call my caseworker so that i can just call once. wait times are insane and with my schedule for work, i don't always have time to wait the extensive wait times.

1. I thought you only has to look for work if you were receiving temporary assistance or cash assistance? 

2. The federal government website says if you have any dependants under 18 you do not have to look for work. How is NY making her look for work when we have 4 kids under 18?  The paper we got from NY DSS says 6, but the federal government says 18? How can NY override the federal government rules?

3. How can she possibly work with her taking care of 4 kids?

The California EBT Website was revamped and relaunched at the end of April 2022. Since someone asked about this, and I do it at least once a day, I thought I'd share the registration process. This is only for CA! 


Your first step is to go to *Benefitscal.com*. Find the link that says *create new account*. keep in mind this is not the start a new application tab!  The create new account hyperlink should be right underneath the log in button.

Set up an email address and password. Answer the security questions (keep in mind it only likes one-worded answers. So if you answer 'what's your favorite color?' just write blue not aqua blue).

You'll receive a verification code via email. Most of the time it doesn't work (known glitch). If this is the case use the one sent via text message. That works 99.9% of the time.

Once you're logged in, find a link that says *link a case*. You can use the last four or your social or your case number. The case number will be case sensitive so make sure all the letters are caps. If there is a zero in your case number can almost guarantee it will but the number 0 and *not* the letter O. it should say ""congrats your case has been linked.""

From there you can explore the site, check your transactions and allotments and complete your paperwork when it's due. It's very useful.

Had my interview and my income still doesn‚Äôt match with my bills but I told them about how a family member gave me some money to help me out with bills. Gave them all of the verification they asked for and a fraud investigator came to my house again this morning. 

He asked me questions about my income and the money I received from family members. He also asked for my landlords number who is a family member. Then he started asking me about my child‚Äôs father, I told them he is in jail; which he is. He was in there for 6 months originally, got out for about 3-4 months, and is now back in there for the last month and a half. He went in there for domestic violence against me originally when he served the 6 months, and he is there again because I called the cops on him for coming to my house and violating the restraining order. I know the reason I am being investigated is because my income didn‚Äôt match my bills so they assume the father is living here and paying, but he‚Äôs literally in jail, although he gets out in a few days. 

They came into my house and looked around, there was nothing for them to think a man is living here or anyone besides myself and my child. My child‚Äôs father and I aren‚Äôt connected in anyway besides having a child together and the court cases. 

The investigator said I could try calling the office at the end of this week to see if I have been approved for Calfresh..

So my question is, is it looking okay for me? I have had him come over at times to see our daughter because I don‚Äôt trust him to take her alone, but he definitely does not live here and doesn‚Äôt spend the night. When he gets out of jail I may allow it as well. Are they gonna continue investigating me? Are they gonna stalk my house and make sure he doesn‚Äôt come over when he gets out of jail? This is just all so ridiculous and I really really need the help with buying food.",,1657743295.0,foodstamps

tb8aw4,Gross income limit for households with elderly/disabled members,"Hello, I'm hoping some eligibility workers or policy specialists can help me better understand a pretty specific aspect of SNAP income eligibility. As far as I know, it is a federal standard that applies to every state that a household that includes an elderly or disabled household member only needs to meet the net income eligibility standard (not the gross income standard). But in many states ([TN](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/human-services/documents/SNAP%20Tn.gov_Income_Update.pdf), [IL](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=30357) for example) the income tables that are displayed on the SNAP pages of agency websites include a separate gross income standard for elderly or disabled households.

sm37jx,I‚Äôm being investigated for food stamp fraud.,"I got a call on Friday from an investigator saying they think my recertification is fraudulent because I and our children live with my ex but didn‚Äôt report his income. I was unaware that I had to report his income because I thought we were considered separate households.

I have been on Medicaid since 2016 when I had to leave my job because o hyperemesis from pregnancy with our first child. I was in a car accident near the end of my pregnancy which injured my back so badly I‚Äôve been unable to go back to work. He‚Äôs always been resentful of this (and me keeping our baby in the first place) and insists that I pay as much as I can of the bills because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not my benefactor‚Äù. 

I ran up debt on my only credit card and had to borrow money from my parents to pay bills after leaving my job in June 2016. In the spring of 2019 I finally received my settlement check which I reported to Medicaid. We bought a house (also reported). I started going back to school that fall but got pregnant and again had severe morning sickness to the point I had to leave school. We broke up shortly after I found out I was pregnant but decided to stay living together because of our daughter. I was able to pay off my credit card and stretch my money until about April of 2020. He helped me for a bit until June of 2020 when he lost his job due to the pandemic. He suggested I go on food stamps because he could not help me anymore without income. 

I applied for food stamps and was approved.
He had put our mortgage on forbearance. All of this was disclosed during my interview to get approved for food stamps. Now we were more strict than ever about separation of expenses because we had to buy our groceries separate. I paid for my food and for my children‚Äôs food and stored it separately as well. He was unemployed for 6 months and paid his share with his unemployment checks. I got by with food stamps and the stimulus checks sent to everyone. He finally got a contract position at the end of January 2021 and started working from home. We continued to split expenses. The roommate situation was working fine for us for awhile. 

Then I find out I‚Äôm pregnant from having slept with him one freaking time at the end of November 2020. I decide to keep baby. I had been self studying at home for a web dev job and felt confident I could get a job which would allow me to be flexible with my schedule and support my children fully. 

During this time time my food stamps are extended twice without them asking for any recertification or interview. I am able to pay my part of the bills from being extremely frugal and getting part of the child tax credit which started in June of 2021. I gave birth to our youngest in August of 2022. Continued to pay for kids expenses and part of the utilities with child care tax credit and my credit card. This whole time mortgage was on forbearance. 

Finally, the county sends me notice that it‚Äôs time to reapply for my food stamps. I send in my recertification at the beginning of December 2021. Ex gets word that the contract position he‚Äôs been working is ready to offer him full time employment but that he‚Äôll have to come into the office 2x /week as an actual employee. I tell him if he does that we‚Äôll have to work out a way to keep me and the kids safe from catching Covid (kids can‚Äôt be vaccinated and I‚Äôm high risk). I suggest he wear a mask when around us. Didn‚Äôt think it would be a big deal since he spent most of his time in the basement (his bed and office were downstairs). He refuses and states he‚Äôd rather move out and live in his motor home. He starts cleaning his stuff out and sleeping in his motor home most of the time which is parked in front of the house. In the meantime, my food stamps have yet to be approved due to backlog.

I finally got a call for an interview at the beginning of last week. Then this past Friday I get another call from an investigator saying I should have reported my ex‚Äôs income. She accused me of still being in a relationship with him saying we looked real happy on Facebook (which is weird cause we have no recent pics together on FB and my profile pic is of me with my baby).  I told her how he had just moved  out and explained we were not a couple.

I am very confused about the whole situation and why the county would think I am trying to lie when I‚Äôve been very forthright this whole time. It was my understanding that we were separate households due to splitting costs of expenses and no longer being a couple. My ex has always insisted that he‚Äôs not liable for my expenses and that since I chose to have kids I needed to support them as best as possible.

So I spent over $10,000 on video games in 2019 before this unforseen disability has ruined my life. I am now on SSDI and receiving food stamps. I thought I would be okay to sell my video game collection because after all I spent the money on it and have receipts. However, I recently found out I'm not allowed to cherry pick and I must average out all the games that I bought and that is my ""expense"" per disc that I am allowed to deduct.

So for example if I sell a game for $50 I am only allowed to deduct the average game price of $0.97 from the sales price since I bought them in lots and bulk leaving me with a profit of $49.03.

Well I've been selling games all year long and have made a profit of over $4,000 so far...

This would definitely lead to my food stamps going away since I should only be receiving $16 before the boost to whatever the emergency maximum is.

How do I go about reporting this income so late? Any idea what the penalty will be? Will I have to pay back all these months of maximum food stamps?

Thanks for any guidance and help. I feel like such an idiot. I would never try to scam the system.",dangerous-handle-280,1630513034.0,foodstamps

I then called the county directly and they transferred me to a supervisor who I left a message with yesterday morning.

Should I continue to wait for a call-back from the supervisor? How long should I wait? Is there anything I can do besides going directly down to the county in person? I have severe social anxiety, just being around people can give me panic attacks.

He gave me my EBT card number, so I can enter it into EBT card services phone number for lost cards. It reports that it is 'unable to access account at this time'. I re-called EBT card services and did not enter any numbers to get to a person. The Person said the card is labeled 'to be printed' and cannot be changed to lost, saying 'unable to change'. I have left another message with my worker detailing this and am waiting to hear back.

I read something about Calfresh SNAP Emergency allotments for $95 but I already had the maximum amount for my household size of one for $234 month.

I did the math and added $95 to my $88.03 remaining balance from my last receipt and subtracted the $112.21 and it comes to exactly the amount it says I have remaining now of $65.82 so I guess you do get the $95 emergency allotment even if you already had the maximum monthly amount for your household size.

fw01mg,Info from DHHS Office of Civil Rights - person posing as an OCR Investigator.,"Greetings all,

I got an email from our Privacy & Security folks this morning that I thought worth sharing since it's not a state issue. This was apparently passed along by the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights division.

> It has come to the attention of the [OCR] that an individual posting as an OCR investigator has contacted HIPAA covered entities in an attempt to gain protected health information.  The individual identified themself on the telephone as an OCR investigator,  but does not provide an OCR complaint transaction number or any other verifiable information relating to an OCR investigation. 

> HIPAA covered entities and businesses associates should alert their workforce members, aaaand can take action to verify that someone is an OCR investigator by asking for the investigator's email address,  which will end in @hhs.gov, and asking for a confirming email from their hhs.gov address.

There's some contact info at DHHS on where to report concerns,  but the lead on it is being done by the FBI.

The money is redeemable by $3, $5, $10, $20 and $50 gift cards and there are loads to choose from. 

If you buy their offers with food stamps, youd essentially be getting free money back since its not coming out of your own pocket. They also have offers for household and personal products .

Whenever someone uses your code, you get 2,000 - 4,000 points. So if you have your family or friends sign up, you can easily make some money.

Ive had this app since July and got $161 as of 2 weeks ago.
Its really helped me save my real money because ive been using gift cards to buy my neccessities or occassionally spoil myself.

Also, my friend buys and returns things sometimes just to get the free points but i dont take it that far lol. 

If you use this code, you'll get 2,000 points (2$) when you sign up and scan a receipt - Q8W75

There are other similar apps such as iBotta but I dont think theyre as good as fetch. Ive earned $43 since July on ibotta. Theres lots of extra rules too but i guess its still money.

The president himself called it a program like Blue Apron style food delivery.  As the year draws to a close and members of Congress are still negotiating changes to the food stamps program, I am curious about how this new program fits into all that. Would like to hear what other people think about this since the press has left that topic alone but I feel like there could be something sneaked out of the lame duck to make these drastic changes the President is requesting. I found [this list of questions](https://foodstampsnow.com/60-questions-about-trumps-food-stamps-harvest-box/) about the program. While some of the questions are over the top, I found the ones below to be important points to addressing if this is where the program is going. Thoughts?  
Who makes the boxes?  
Who decides what goes in the boxes?  
What about fresh fruits and veggies?  
What if you don‚Äôt receive your box one month?  
What if you‚Äôre homeless?  
What if you don‚Äôt have a place to receive mail?  
What if you have allergies?  
Is the value of the box the same as the value of the SNAP?  
What‚Äôs the overhead cost?  
Do folks receiving government assistance deserve to get to choose their own food?  
Does the box change based on family composition?  
Will companies be able to lobby to change the contents of the boxes?  
Will the government accept free food from companies?

16l4t44,I'm so worried. I got notified that I could lose SNAP due to work requirements and I barely earn enough to survive.,"[ RI ]

I happen to live in one of the few parts of my state that didn't renew the SNAP waiver. (Why couldn't the whole state extend the waiver?) I live with family due to the unrealistic prospect of affording my own place right now, far below the poverty line.

I've been receiving the maximum $281 1-person household benefit and it's been a lifesaver because without it I'd have little left for expenses and saving goals including a car.

Due to complex circumstances that I won't go into too much detail with, I can basically mentally only handle self-employment online which is what I've done. I estimate it's $800 per month usually and can be unpredictable, so it could be less by a couple hundred dollars too.

Putting aside mental health support I need, I am desperate to maintain my benefits to survive on my low income. I get no support from family (another long story, summary is narcissists).

I don't know what to say to SNAP or how to input this information. There is a website I can do this on. I saw on some other posts I found that people who make $1000 or around there can expect to get the 1 person max benefit.

This income is fully earned. There is one other factor which is occasional income from plasma donations which is given on a prepaid debit card. I am not sure how that factors in.

Do I need to complete a form that certifies this self-employment income, give the amount? How do they calculate deductions and such, like rent? I also read that if you make the equivalent of 80 hours x federal min. wage, that qualifies, which is $580.",windeu,1694967372.0,foodstamps

Did I get this because my kids had free lunches at school the past year?  I don't know if every kid took them, but I'm pretty sure every kid could have gotten free lunches for the last two years because something Newsom implemented.  So did every family get these cards?

13bxkqv,How exactly does renewal work - GA,"About a month ago when I was suppose to get my April benefits, I logged into my gateway account and saw that my case was closed because I missed the renewal date. For clarity the mailboxes for my apartment were trashed because of vandalism so until they're replaced all my mail is held at the local post office which is 6 miles out from where I live and I don't have a car to visit there on a regular basis. 

   I have it set up where I'm suppose to get both physical AND email notices, but I never received an email and thus missed the renewal date. The notice said that I can still send in a renewal application within the 30 days of the SNAP case being closed so I did that day on the 7th, a Friday, and the letter I received after said that it'll start processing it on the 10th of Monday. The letter said that it'll take up to 30 days to process and that I should expect a phone call from my case worker for extra information and that's the last I've heard of anything since. 

   I've tried calling, but it's all machines and no one is available to pick up. I've tried going to the offices, but they're either closed for that day or no one is seeing anyone unless you have a prior appointment, which I can't get because I get nothing but machines and busy lines. It's coming up on the 30th day since I've hit submit and I still haven't received a call or been able to get in contact with a human at the offices. I'm just getting a bit anxious about this because I've had to blow through my savings to put food in the house and now we're on two months without that needed support and it's starting to get tight. So I'm just wondering if the process is normally this long? Is there a way to speed this process up? To get a hold of someone to know if my case was even looked at? Will the benefits just be there on the 10th? I understand this service is understaffed and people are trying their hardest to work with a broken system but it's really stressful to be kept in the dark like this.",jojojelatto,1683564468.0,foodstamps
139ra33,Employee error results in loss of benefits. Please help in how to get reimbursed?,"I was sent my re-application paperwork last month, filled it out sent it in early. Soon after I receive mail asking for documentation of my income (I have $0 income and writing in the amount a family member pays my landlord directly was misunderstood on the application as income towards myself). The letter had a date I needed to give this info by. So I took the only option I could and called the office. 

My partner spoke for me, besides me giving personal identifying info. He explained the situation to the woman who completely understood the mistake and said she was changing in the system to reflect that I do not receive any income. She also asked if we would like to officially put my partner on as an authorized representative to make calls like this for me, which we said yes. She assured us on the phone that this was all complete. This was 5 business days before the info was required. 

Less than a week later, on the day I receive my benefits each month nothing was deposited into my account. Of course it was a Friday evening when I was about to order groceries, so I had to wait until Monday to call to try to figure out the issue. There was no notice in the mail of my benefits ending. So I was hungry and distressed all weekend. 

My partner and I call twice Monday, only to be sent to the voicemail of a Supervisor who did not return my call.

Tuesday (5 days without benefits now) we call again and after it being mentioned that my partner is NOT authorized as a representative for me, I make the realization - **they have cancelled my benefits because the original woman be called over a week before lied about correcting my information** We make this very clear with them, and at first they claim there is no call on record from us on the 10th (when we first called, they later admitted to having the call logged and gave us the employees name). We‚Äôre then thrown around to a useless supervisor, a few more voicemails (all while we are being told that we are being sent to someone who is currently ready to take our call). 

When we finally speak to someone, the best she can offer is that my benefits would be back in ANOTHER 5 days. We repeat how they have admitted this to be an issue where one of their employees fraudulently claimed she took actions that only a Case Manager or higher could do and then I lost my benefits due to her negligence and expressed the emotional distress of trying to get the food I need, that never should have been taken from me. We asked for the name and number of this supervisor‚Äôs supervisor. 

We took a bit of time to breathe, since we had been on the phone for hours. This supervisor calls us herself in the meantime, pretty quickly she tells us she is fixing the issue and that my benefits will be back in my account by 9am the next morning and gives us her direct number to call if it isn‚Äôt. 

The next day, it‚Äôs there!! But then‚Ä¶I realize if I was formally receiving benefits on the 21st and now it‚Äôs the 26th, due to *their* error/negligence, what happens to the 5 days of benefits I missed due to their error? For me, that‚Äôs almost $50 and I completely depend on every cent, esp since the COVID benefits just stopped and food costs continue to rise. 

I left the supervisor direct voicemails this past Wednesday and again yesterday and have not heard back yet. Will I be able to get this reimbursed? Is there more I can or should be doing to report this whole situation?

Thanks for any help or input. This has been such a headache and I‚Äôm already in an unwell physical and mental state, just barely keeping myself surviving.

Update 5/2/23: I finally received a call back from a top supervisor in my county (she had been out of office for personal reasons). She understood my concern, and assured that my benefits will return to the 21st starting this month, so there will be no missing benefits. She explained that the date that benefits are received is based on social number, something none of the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in the comments were able to mention in all their talk of policy. This was the exact answer I needed and I‚Äôm grateful that the head of my county not only showed true care and compassion for me, but truly put in the time and effort to understand my concern and correct an egregious error of an employee.",thirdeye_13,1683383231.0,foodstamps

I said when I applied I'm the notes section that I have currently put in around 8 applications for work for places near me, and was waiting on calls back or emails. On the followup phone call with the nice lady, I asked her how I report if I'm looking for a job since I saw there were work requirements and she said ""oh, you don't"". I was confused because I have to be looking for work in order to be applicable, but there's no way to report it, I asked how am I supposed to follow the guidelines and she said ""you just need to call and tell us when you accept a job offer"". I got the approved mail a little bit ago (got the card yesterday) and it's saying I have to follow the work requirements like trying to find a job and if I don't follow the requirements I can lose benefits, and I'm just kind of anxiety panicking because its not saying anywhere a place I can report the info too like an email or anything. I'm just worried because I don't want to do anything wrong but I'm not finding a place I can say ""I've applied for such and such job"" or ""I've been interviewed at this location"". I've tried calling but I've always been on hold for over an hour before the line just drops. I just want to do things correctly and I'm worrying and panicking because I don't know what or how to do.

My secind question, what's a good list for buying things with snap? Like, I keep just seeing ""take a look at your pantry and see what you don't have"" or ""here are the things you can and can't buy"", I just want a list of like ""here's what I bought that got me through my foodstamps time"" or ""this is what I recommend you buy"", I just don't want to make a mistake and I know if I just try to ""get what I don't have"" I'm afraid I'll get something that isn't going to be touched, or I'll just mess up somewhere and make a mistake, I just want a guideline to follow and stuff, ""this much meat"", ""this much rice/pasta/beans"", ""this much veggies""

Sorry if these get asked a lot, I spent the last three hours trying to look this stuff up and just got overwhelmed when it was the same ""here are the work guidelines"" or ""here's what can and can't be bought"" over and over and over.

My first SNAP renewal was automatic. I got the letter in the mail stating that it would be from 12/1/22 to 5/31/23. I started my new job on 12/5/22.

 I called to have my Medicaid canceled because my insurance would begin sometime in January 2023. They had me send an email to the worker I was on the phone with and told me it would be canceled. I think I also received something in the mail about cancelation. 

After my first paycheck I called to report my income change and stated that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP. The worker asked for my identifying info and just confirmed that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP benefits. They didn't ask for verification of my increased income though. I thought everything was handed.

In January, a friend helped me with applying for SSDI, Food Assistance, and Medicaid. Yesterday I got a call from DCF to do my phone interview, and the worker said that I would need to fill out a job contacts form; from what I can see, it looks like it's asking me to apply for 20 jobs and write the contact information for all of them, and then turn in the form to DCF by 02/20/2023. I can try to apply for jobs, but that seems irresponsible knowing that I will be unable to work if I receive an offer. If I knew I could work, I would just go back to my previous job. I asked the worker if it was absolutely necessary for me to fill out the job contacts form in order to receive assistance, and she didn't give me a straight answer. Is there a specific way I should phrase this concern? Should I try again with a different worker?

I went into me CalWin account and it now shows my EBT benefit is ""Discontinued"". I never received any letter or notice. I am on my 90th minute of waiting on hold to find out what is up.

My Question For you guys - I have $900 on my EBT card. Will it be available for me to use into next month or will it evaporate tonight at the end of the month. It does show I was Discontinued 9/30 so it did carry into October. But I dont know if I should run to the store and do some massive shopping or if it will be here tomorrow. Any advice would be great!

I am applying for EBT after never having done it. i was always hesitant about it...kind of an ego thing...but I need it now.

Question being....benefits.gov says 

""To be eligible for this benefit program, you must be a resident of the state of California and meet one of the following requirements:

You have a current bank balance (savings and checking combined) under $2,001""

But the Department of Social Services site says there is no resource Limit  on most househouseholds...and its a measure of CURRENT income.

ya2x74,FL SNAP - caseworker may be using incorrect amounts (Gross instead of Net),"I've been struggling with my application process since early July, the online submission and update process is not great and I feel like the system is purposely more difficult than it needs to be.

Trying to get through on the phone interview is as difficult as everyone knows...and this was prior to Hurricane Ian.

My spouse is disabled so the means testing is scaled for that;  you can qualify using the Gross or Net income amounts.  When we initially applied, I was receiving unemployment and was told that our Gross income was too high but nothing was ever said about qualifying using our Net.  I started working two weeks into September so our Income went up by an entire $70.00/month.  

Early this week they finally (!) made a determination on the changes to income I filed in September, we received $86.00 benefit for September with a letter explaining that we don't qualify for October because our Monthly Gross Income is now too high - again, with the Gross Income limits and a mention of an income limit amount that I don't recognize. 

I can't get through on the number listed on the notice letter, a recording says it's no longer available for interviews and I must call the 850 number - but you can't really get through there either because either the system is too busy or if you hold for a representative your call is disconnected.

I know it's especially busy now, if there were a better way of checking the figures on the website I would do it & save the trouble of trying to speak with someone.

Are the caseworkers aware of the fact that households with a disabled member can qualify using either the Gross Income, or if that is too high, then also using the Net Income?",serenity-now258,1666381877.0,foodstamps

The first time I made a call to report all the transactions (like the day of when I saw fradulent activity) that I know for a fact I did not make ended up with the person only helping me write a claim for one transaction, and it wasn't even the transaction I had a problem with.

I called again after realizing they didn't help with my problem, and this time they actually wrote a claim for the 5 transactions I had an issue with. These 5 transactions totaled up more than a months worth of benefits.

Now I got the letter back today saying that all of them are denied.

What gives. I really didn't spend any on any of these transactions that were made in a county that I hardly ever go to.

xxi92y,Can a card stay active if your balance is $0 and your monthly benefits amount is $0?,"Hope this question makes sense, I've been so confused by the process. So I lost my job and I applied for SNAP when my income was zero and got the maximum allotment of benefits I believe (I had no assets or dependents and wasn't receiving any other assistance if it matters).

About a week ago I finally found another job that pays a couple dollars above minimum wage. However, after plugging in my new information to https://fscalc.dhs.illinois.gov/FSCalc/ I find that I pass the net monthly income test and asset test but I fail the gross monthly income test and my estimated ""Potential monthly benefit amount""
 is $0

 I am submitting my change of information now, but I am wondering what that process looks like- is my card revoked/my account shut down because I make too much now? Or will my card and account stay active with a $0 balance in case my income changes? Like if I lose this job or my hours get cut. I am only barely making too much to be above the 130% poverty limit. If I made about $100 less per month I'd be below it. 

I'm really hoping the later in case something happens and I lose this job, so I won't have to go through the process again (it took me almost 3 weeks from applying to receiving my card, and a month before getting any funds iirc which is why it scares me).

>	Effective October 1, Pennsylvania will increase the income threshold for all applicants to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines (FPIG). With this change, more than 420,000 additional Pennsylvanians in more than 174,000 households will be newly eligible for SNAP and will receive, on average, $63 a month.

PA families with at least one elderly (60+) or disabled household member were already subject to a 200% FPIG income limit, but for everyone else, the income limit is increasing from 160% FPIG to 200% FPIG.

This change is **in addition** to the annual cost-of-living (ie inflation) update to income limits and benefit amounts, which will also go into effect on October 1.

I received the letter on 3 March that stated everything should be turned in by 5 March. So I mailed in the requested forms, as well as uploaded them in case it didn't reach their office within a day. They ended up disqualifying me, saying they didn't receive my documentation, including what was uploaded online despite the fact that I can see it's there.

I have been trying to get in touch with the caseworker for three weeks, leaving voicemails and waiting to hear back.

Flash forward to now and I had to reapply, including new information like my son being born, and this time my interview took a lot longer to happen. They want verification documents but I still have not received the letter that explains which things they need from me. She said she sent it last Thursday via mail and I still have not received it a week later and we only have 10 days to submit. That leaves me three business days at this point. I really wish I had the caseworker I was given initially because she got everything that I uploaded without any issues, and genuinely seemed to care. The latest 2 caseworkers have just not been on it and I really need the assistance. Would they know if I request a new caseworker, would they make a note of it somewhere so that people could potentially discriminate against me in that way?

I recently qualified for SNAP. Me and my boyfriend live together but he‚Äôs the only one making income. I‚Äôm currently a student and unemployed. We have no kids together, just us two. 

I didn‚Äôt include him in my household when applying because I‚Äôm the only one who eats home cooked food and for the most part I‚Äôm the only one ever cooking or using the stove and buying groceries. He just usually eats out or buys something from a restaurant and brings it home. 

He‚Äôs starting to work less and see how important it is to cook food to save money. So we‚Äôre wondering would anything happen to my food stamps if he applies and they see we live in the same address?

I did see that NC has stopped its 15% benefits increase as of October but that really just dropped it down maybe $20-30? So, it's still a decent amount if we were to get the max allotment for a family of 4.

She sent me a email back saying ""thanks for letting her know, she would forward the email to the case worker to review""....  
My question is; I called the EBT card and it still has the same amount of money 'set' to be placed on the card soon, so no 'increase yet'. I would think they likely will need ""documentation"" of the split bills (that I now pay). Which affects my overall income...

prwsi1,College Student - Pandemic Exemption,"Hi all,

Starting in January 2021, there was federal legislation that expanded SNAP benefits to college students during the public health emergency. It made students who were eligible for work study and who had an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of 0 eligible to receive food stamps.

I applied back in May and was approved. I'm currently a non-Ohio resident going to school in Ohio for graduate school, I was approved for work study, and have an EFC of 0 due to being a grad student.

However, I've had some recent worries about my eligibility. I uploaded all the documents required, such as my bank account, my personal IDs, information about my car and rent payments, student loans, roommate information, so on and so forth. I had a phone interview where they asked me a few questions and then approved me.

I've found some inconsistent information about asset testing-- I found the federal limits for assets regarding bank accounts and assets such as cars, and those financial limits, which I am above. However, I believe I've found information that states Ohio doesn't do asset testing when considering eligibility for food stamps, but nothing concrete. I did find information about income levels, which I am well below as I was unemployed, and I am currently earning \~$400/month from work study (which is not counted as regular income, I believe).

Essentially, I'm worried that I was approved mistakenly because of this special exception, and that it will be found and I'll have to pay the money back. As a grad student, you can imagine that I don't really have much excess money to do so. If anyone who is more familiar with the SNAP program could address my concerns, I would be incredibly grateful.

TLDR: Ohio grad student who is a non-resident of Ohio approved for food stamps, income level is well below poverty line but has assets above the federal limit. Not sure if my residency status or assets disqualify me and I was misapproved and will owe money back.

pqvcu6,CalFresh Fraud Questions,"New here. I recently applied for and received CalFresh benefits. After about a month I got notified that they were being revoked because my qualifying child no longer lives with me. The child does in fact live with me so I filed for an appeal, had a hearing, the county told me during the hearing what specific documents I needed to submit and I have since submitted them. I presume that they will reinstate my benefits but who knows how this stuff goes. 

Now for my life story and questions. 

I am mid divorce. My ex is somewhat unstable. My ex has claimed our child to receive benefits too. We recently went to court and the court ordered that I am to have sole legal and physical custody of the child. The order states that the child is to have about ten hours of supervised time with the other parent. This seems very straightforward that I should be the one that can claim the child for this purpose.

I got a giant packet from the county that had notes of various events in my case and includes references to claims made by my ex spouse about the child custody. The timing of the statements are such that that they were made to the county agent after the date of the court order. To me, this seems like a clear case of my ex spouse committing fraud to the county.

My question is if there is anything I should do to report the fraud apart from doing what I need to prove that I should receive the benefit.  I have provided documentation that shows the custody order and I expect it to be clear. Should I just wait for the county to get back to me?  Should I report the fraud somehow?  Does it sound like this will get sorted out fairly?

I do not want to report my ex for vindictive reasons, but they have been making many many false accusations about me publicly, partly because of un treated mental illness. My goal is not to get them in trouble but I feel like I need to be addressing these fraudulent issues when they can affect me and my child.

Any thoughts?  Thank you!",itsrainingmenses,1632002024.0,foodstamps
pmpwrk,Calfresh/ EBT Overpayment,"Hello,

I have a question regarding my Calfresh EBT/Snap Benefits. I started receiving Calfresh Snap Benefits in September of 2020 after being laid off due to COVID. I was finally called back to work at the end of June 2021. I tried contacting my caseworker but was never able to get a hold of her, so I mailed the information that I was starting up with my job again.

Now I'm in September 2021, I havent used the ebt card since I started working end of June because I thought that because I mailed them my info/income that I would be making, that my benefits would stop. But I get an email asking me to "" renew my application so my benefits do not stop."" The next day, I get a call from a case worker asking if I could complete my renewal application over the phone. I tell her that I am not eligible for Calfresh Benefits anymore because I am working. She asks me to complete it anyway so that I am confirmed denied. Stupid me, I quickly try to get it overwith because I am at work. I answer her questions and even confirm my income that I've recently made from my job for the last 4 weeks.

Few days pass by I get an email to check my enotices on Calwin. I havent logged in a while at this point because I have not been utilizing my ebt card and thought I stopped my benefits. I log in and see that I have still been receivng benefits after June when I reported my wages! I check the enotices, and  see the letter of denial as expected, but I also see this enotice (please see attached).

Has anyone else received this enotice or know what it means? Am I being investigated for fraud? Or is it just a notice that they checked my work records just to determine my eligibilty? It really sucks that I am finding this out on a weekend because I have to wait until monday to call a caseworker and get this straightened out. It's making me kind of anxious having to wait. If anyone has the answer or can put me at ease, I would greatly appreciate it.

onpg22,Does moving counties/households count toward overpayment?,"Hi folks! I'm a student that recently graduated college back in May so I moved back to my home county (all in California.) I was receiving CalFresh benefits since I was living in campus apartments with no income. When I moved back I was still receiving benefits but I did not use them, and my Sar-7 recertification was scheduled for this month. I got a call today from my case worker who asked why my mail was being returned to the sender and that's when I notified them that I had moved back in May and that the old address was no longer valid (please note she did not ask for my current address.) The connection was pretty bad but she said that she would close my case and that I could still use the balance. The call ended there but I am currently worried because 1. I know I neglected to report the move and subsequent income change since my parents work (as opposed to my then roommates who also had CalFresh) and 2. The balance is obviously quite large since I hadn't touched it since May, so if I use it and the county somehow determines it was an over-issuance, will I have to pay all of it back?  Would anyone recommend just leaving the balance alone in that case?

Well, during my interview the person asked me for my sons birth certificate and I told her I hadn‚Äôt ordered it. She said he would be disqualified then. I told her that was fine, he is only 7 months. She then asked about the father. I told her I didn‚Äôt know him. She then asked if he pays child support. I again told her I didn‚Äôt know him. She then told me I‚Äôm approved PENDING my sons birth certificate and income verification. 

I guess I‚Äôm confused. I‚Äôm fine with him not being included. I just need food for me. I told her I didn‚Äôt have it and she said I need to order it.

I have been receiving CalFresh (CA EBT) benefits for about 7 months.  I started a new job 4/1, and get paid monthly.  I received my first paycheck/paystub beginning of May, and called in to cancel my benefits 5/6.  I received my benefits 5/5 ($194) the day before.  

I successfully cancelled my benefits over the phone on 5/6 and have not received any NEW deposits, but still have the $194 from May.  Am I able to use these funds even though I have been receiving an income, or if I spend it will I owe the money back?  I obviously would love to use the funds if I can to help with groceries.

f66f5l,"CalFresh Overissuance, but have not spent EBT funds","Los Angeles, California. My parents applied for CalFresh this past fall because they were laid off. They used/spent the food stamp money they received for only a month (October) because they each found a job again. A week after they started work, they went in person to tell their case worker that they no longer needed food stamp assistance. They took their paystubs, and the caseworker told them to email her a copy of one paystub they forgot (I did that for them later that day). After two weeks, they hadn't received notice that their assistance would stop, so my mom called. The case worker had an attitude and said she didn't know about any mail or emails because she hadn't checked her mail in a month, and told my mom they would receive a letter when it's done. Two weeks pass, nothing, so my mom calls again, and someone else tells her she can't connect her to her case worker because she's on vacation and no one else can look into my parents' case until she gets back. My mom got tired of trying and didn't go back in person because no one ever helps and it's frustrating.

Now in February, after I figured out how to set up their online account, I can see that they kept receiving money from CalFresh. It's about to 1k, now. I submitted the semi-annual report (sar 7) for them on Feb 11 with the completed form and uploaded their paystubs (however, it says ""incomplete 2/14/20"" now under case status information).
I'm worried this will probably be considered overissuance, even though my parents alerted the office they no longer wanted assistance. They also stopped touching the money once they found their jobs. 

Q: Will they have to pay back the money, or can we expect that all the money on their EBT/CalFresh account will be taken instead (and they won't have to pay out of their pocket)?

ei075z,$16 a month in food benefits? (Michigan),"This doesn't sound right to me but I'm really not sure, I could be wrong so I wanted y'alls opinion. I have an idea why due to unverified rent costs but I'm really not sure. I received a letter today from DHS saying that I qualify for assistance but only $16 per month.

I currently roughly make $330 a week, 1,386 a month and $16,632 a year. My rent costs $800 per month, $9,600 per year leaving me with $7032 for the year.

I also have an electric, internet, phone bill and transportation costs.

My electric bill it's about $60 a month, $720 a year, bringing the total money I have to spend down to $6,322

My transportation costs about $30 a week, $1,512 a year leaving me with $4,810 to spend for the year

Phone bill is $35 a month, $420 a year. Bringing the total I have left to $4,399

Internet is $60 a month, $720 a year leaving me with a grand total of $3,679 to spend that year.

I don't know what expenses are accounted for when determining what your benefit amount will be but $16 per month seems low to me..I honestly don't know so I wanted to ask your opinions. I saw a link on one of the posts in here about a benefit calculator but cannot get it to work. Not sure why. Maybe it's because on trying to use it on a phone.

Is this correct? She said that if we pulled our kids out of school and had them in a daycare, we could deduct the expenses, but because it was at an actual school that it no longer counts.

I've tried to call my Program Integrity person in the county I'm in now, for weeks, and I've had no call backs and unfortunately never been able to get ahold of her. 

Anyway, my soon to be ex husband apparently put my name on the application and drew EBT benefits January-March while he was unemployed and I was out of the country.

They tried to transfer me to Program Integrity and of course the call dropped. I've left 5-6 messages on her voicemail asking for a call back to discuss the situation but never received a call.

bbi96r,Michigan food assistance much less than I have been getting for the last decade or so.,"TLDR: Screwed up didnt get reauthorization done in October. Got back on in January but monthly total is $140 a month less. Income and monthly expenses didn't change.

&#x200B;

Have been on food assistance for 9-10 years.  Always the max, maybe a few months here and there with less, but always corrected.  Approved for SSI 5 years ago, max monthly payment. Housing is 450 total, rent and utilities paid in one lump sum. 

Anxiety and procrastination made me miss the due date to get paperwork handed in on time last October.  Finally got it straightened out through an online application at the end of December.  Assistance back on for January, but for only $54 a month, when the last few years it has been $194 or so.  

Called my worker, she confirmed the math lined up, and when I asked why my amount is so much lower she kinda avoided the question.  Asked again, and she said something about a change to deductions. Me paying everything together is causing me to not get all deductions, or something like that.

I guess why I am posting, is to see if anyone else has gone through something like this recently, and did you find a way to fix it.  I'm considering leaving the program, and then going to someone that helps people with the application, but need to check if there's a time limit before i'm able to reapply.

15w97ud,Work requirement for one parent while the other works.,"We have 4 kids, ages 6, 8, 10, and 16. I work full time, and my wife is the stay at home parent. We get food stamps for everyone, kids and both parents. Location: NY. 

Recently, we got a letter saying my wife has to look for work soon to continue food stamps. We are completely unable to both work. With 4 kids, you have to have 1 parent at home. The 16 year old goes in and out to her biological mothers. So, she is completely unreliable for babysitting. Each kid gets out at different times for school, and the youngest gets out first. Christmas vacations, summers, etc. We can't leave the kids home alone.

A babysitter would nullify the income of one parent working. Also, ever since our 16 year old fell found the stairs at a daycare, we said we would never again use a daycare or babysitter ever again. Plus, I had to fight DSS for daycare pay costs. The whole babysitter/daycare was a nightmare 16 years ago, and it left us with the intention that we would never ever do that again. 

Can my wife just opt out of food stamps to not go look for work while myself and the kids are on food stamps to bypass the requirement of looking for work? I'm not sure if the requirement is because my wife is on my case or because she is in the household at all and not working. It's my food stamp case with my wife and kids on mine. So could I just remove her from it?

PS. Anyone who thinks a stay at home parent isn't working is BS. Her day is filled with cleaning, laundry, cooking, homework, etc. It just doesn't make any money.

I was easily able to qualify for snap benefits in Az because, in spite of my wife working, our outgo was actually larger than our income. I was finally awarded my SSDI early retirement last October which included a year of eligible back pay ( which disappeared almost immediately due to unpaid bills). My snap benefits were canceled upon my receiving my disability income, which was to be expected. Yesterday I received a notice that all my snap moneys I received would have to be paid back. There was no explanation, just a listing of what I was paid over the year and a half that I received the benefits. Can they retroactively request the return of the money because of the SSDI backpay I received? What if I had won a lottery a year later? Would I have to return the money even though I was truly eligible at the time? Seems really fishy to me. Any insight would be appreciated. I will also be calling them for an explanation.

13xpo8a,[NYC] Landlord claiming not to have received rent assistance check,"Hello!

I have an active Cash Assistance (CA) case in NYC. CA includes Rent Assistance in my case. NYC HRA said they sent two rent assistance payments directly to my landlord. Landlord is claiming they received the second (~$100), but not the first (~$500).

I contacted HRA and they said they sent both checks to the same address (a P.O. Box) so they should've received the first since they received the second. They also said both checks were cashed out.

HRA gave me a check # and the date it was cashed out. I told my landlord this information and they insist that they never received it, it's not in their records.

13wd9z9,SNAP and TANF reallocation,"I am trying to figure out how budget management works at social services offices in most states.

From what I understand, the state allocates a certain amount for SNAP + TANF, and the counties in each state then take what they receive and earmark a certain amount for operating expenses and then the rest to the benefits. However, when the quarter ends with less applicants than were expected, I've read they can choose to carry over the funds to the next quarter, to use in case of a surge in applications, or they can also choose to just reallocate the funds at their discretion, or even return it to the state government.

The last two things are what I'm mostly curious about. Any public finance people know what happens to the money usually in these cases? I figure it going directly into payroll again would probably be restricted.  


Also, side question that I'm not as curious about, in case you're feeling generous! If the state governments get their SNAP/TANF allocations from federal funding, isn't that kind of weird? It sort of ties what's going on in 49 other state economies to your own likely very different state's economy, forcing you to change the amount of tax dollars from your own state that you're allocating for public assistance?

When I was approved for SNAP last June 2022, after I activated the Link card, whenever I would call the automated system (number on the back of the card), I would hear the following message:

Your snap balance is $\_\_\_

You are scheduled to received SNAP benefits on the 2nd of each month through May 2023.

I received a packet in the mail late April 2023 to renew benefits. 

I completed the form and mailed back. I called the manage my case number about 2 weeks later to make sure it was received. It was. The automated system asked for my case number and said I was approved.  I transferred to a case manager to be sure. Sometime later, a caser worker called me to do an interview. After the interview was completed, I asked her what should I expect next? I was told that if I called back tomorrow (the following day) the system would say approved which it does.

However, when I check my snap balance (a different phone number/system than manage my case) for May, it just tells me the balance, it no longer says the date I am scheduled to receive benefits. I thought it should say the time frame I am scheduled to receive benefits (June 2023 to May 2024) and the date every month as I stated above.

On May 3, I checked around midnight to make sure I received my benefits and they were there. Later that day around 2 pm I went to the ATM to withdraw the funds from my ebt card and then deposit into my bank account so I could pay my rent. The ATM said insufficient funds which I thought was strange so I entered another lower amount and it said the same thing. I checked on the provider app and to my surprise it said $840 withdrawn from a US Bank in Apple Valley six hours ago. 

I am about an hour away from Apple Valley and have no car. Then I realized my card is in my hand how the heck is this possible. From there I called the 877 number on the back and they issued another card and said to call and report the incident to the welfare office. In person I submitted the proper paperwork and three other people were there for the same thing. The guy helping me told me on May 2nd there were fifteen people who had the same problem. I also filed a police report although I was told I did not need to anymore.

They said it takes 21 days, I‚Äôm assuming and hoping that means 21 days to receive my funds again. However, my rent is due and I just do not know what to do. Has this happened to anyone else and how long did it take to receive funds? I did search this up before posting and found a lot of people have had their benefits stolen in this way. I am just unsure about the timeline or process for cash benefits.

I‚Äôm afraid my landlord will evict me, I received a three day notice on the 5th. It is well passed three days, I don‚Äôt think he cares that this happened and I don‚Äôt have it.

Thanks in advance and sorry this is all over the place, I haven‚Äôt been thinking straight since this happened.

1386ujd,"[NJ] The system says I completed my recertification, when. My benefits were not deposited.","(New Jersey) THE SYSTEM SAYS I COMPLETED MY RECERTIFICATION INTERVIEW WHEN I DID NOT. MY BENEFITS ARE LATE.

I‚Äôm living in *NJ* and I got a letter for re certification in March 2023. I missed the call due to a medical reason. When I called the county to reschedule the woman that answered the phone said that when she looked up my information that the interview process said ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. I told her I did not complete the over the phone interview and she wouldn‚Äôt reschedule me. I called back later on that day and the next person I spoke to said that I will receive a letter of what the next steps are after missing an appointment.

About a week later I received a letter in the mail stating I missed my phone appointment It said, I need to call the county line to reschedule my phone interview or my benefits would terminate at the end of April.

I called back the next day to reschedule and I was told yet again that the system said I completed everything I needed to do and that I did not need to do anything. I explained that I missed my phone appointment in March and received a letter stating I missed my appointment, and again I was told that it said completed in the system.

I received benefits from Nov-April. Each month except November my FS balance was deposited on the 3rd. I did not receive benefits yesterday (May 3rd).

How do I find out about the status? I do not have a case worker or an extension other than the regular hotline on the back of the card and the County Board of Social Services.

Obviously, I am not doing well with phone calls. I‚Äôm wondering if I should go down to the office tomorrow morning rather than calling.

I have received my FS every month of the 3rd since December 2022.  

Is there anyway to check status or pending deposit? Does anyone know if the providers app or connectebt.com shows pending deposits for FS?

Any help is greatly appreciated.",thatwayi3ear,1683250965.0,foodstamps

No mail from my county's social services or email that I used for MyBenefitsCalWin notified me that my account was disabled for some reason.  Now I have more questions than answers. Which site to use out of the three? Create a new account for MyBenefitsCalWin? What would be the case number ebt.ca.gov wants me to use to register a new account?

Someone will contact you 3 to 5 days. 30 to 45 days 24 to 48 hours. I have also submitted a request for communication about 8 times on the  portal and it states someone will contact you in 2 days. None of this has happened. I'm being toyed with and lied to continuously like my life is a big joke. When I have gotten through to talk to the call center it's the same phone number that takes a message for all workers. The Supervisor's number is the same as my case worker as the same for all workers. The lady at the call center told me to not call on Fridays because most workers take that day off. I believe it. I'm uncomfortable giving these people all my personal information. There's much much more but I will stop here. I was just wondering if this is normal procedure, protocol.

12yq31r,Something non-food got charged on my SNAP card.,"Like the title says, something non-food was charged to my snap card. 

When we were checking out, I had this coupon for food items, and everything for the coupon at checkout. There was an error with one of them, and the checker saw I had the right item and fixed it. Note, the checker didn‚Äôt know we were using SNAP or anything. She did something, but I was surprised when a $1 hot wheels car was charged to the card. Usually when I have non-food items on the same ticket, I charge the SNAP card and then the remainder on my debit. That‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs always been. 

I‚Äôm just perplexed by what happened. I wanted to come on here and ask if I‚Äôll get in trouble for this error. I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôll get in trouble for this. I‚Äôm not trying to commit fraud, especially when it comes to a $1 Hot Wheels car. So, will I get in trouble?

12probq,NM SNAP-- Work/Work-Like Requirements?,"I'm a graduate student towards the end of my program. On top of classes I have a 20 hour/week unpaid internship, and work about 17.5 hours Fri-Sun. I just had my recertification phone interview and learned that college students need to work at least 20 hour/week to qualify for SNAP benefits. Previously, I've been over that amount because it was pre-internship, and so I had forgotten to consider it as an issue.

After some searching I saw one NM document say, ""A SNAP recipient identified as an ABAWD must meet a **20 hour-a-week** work or work-like requirement in order to maintain eligibility.""

My question is if my unpaid internship would count under ""work-like,"" and how I would report these hours to HSD? Another option might be to increase my work hours, but my time is already very tight. Does anyone have some insight on this? Thanks!",serene-starlight,1681755793.0,foodstamps
