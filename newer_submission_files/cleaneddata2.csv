scheduled phone interview for food stamps but my case worker never called i applied for food stamps in georgia on monday received a letter and call on thursday saying i had a interview on friday (today) at : well low and behold no phone call anxiously waiting i called my case worker's direct line around : no answer but i left a message does this typically mean a person has been denied my application online says registration complete i've been denied previously reason being i made too much money (it has to be just pennies over) since then my rent has went up $ not to mention the cost of groceries keep going up
"(wa) didn't receive  month review i've been receiving snap in wa since sept last year when they approved me over the phone they said i'd have a  month review but i never was contacted about anything from them and my benefits kept on coming

is this something i should be worrying about is a six month review always done or maybe this is something with the pandemic to not have one i've never been on food stamps before this so i'm not sure on the protocol thanks for any help"

"psa - multiple changes to snap coming this year with a new year new changes to snap are coming  we're seeing lots of questions on this category and this is a general ""you should know"" rather than state-specific it is important to remember that states apply for waivers from the feds and those can get approved or denied depending

*  raising the floor and ceiling - my understanding is that the new omnibus spending bill raised both minimum and maximum allotment amounts for all households through june  

*  pandemic supplemental - independently of the raise in amounts  states are asking for on a month-to-month basis to issue up to the max amount january amounts have been announced for some states as of this morning  but that's being slower than it has been  refer back to your state agency on this - we may know here or we may not 

*  automatic recertifications - some states are auto-renewing households for another six months

*  no-interview waivers - some states have been approved for processing applications without interviews check with your local agency when you apply on this"

help am i in trouble okay so my husband myself and our daughter have been receiving food stamps in texas my name is on the case and since my husband is our only source of income we decided to get food stamps back in i believe  he had been working as a mechanic in a dealership and was paid by how much work they gave him not hourly so sometimes we would only receive - a week depending on how much they gave him so we qualified for  a month but he recently changed jobs back in february  is when he started with the new job i completely forgot to make the change and i made the change the last week of february i read that if he makes over k a month we won’t qualify which i think he does make more since he’s now working up north i also read that once i knew about the change of job i had to have reported it  days of knowing and i didn’t because i forgot i made the change and till this day i keep receiving the  plus the increase that they had been giving i am now at  dollars on my ebt app and i’m not sure if i can use them since i already reported the change and they keep sending the money to me the change on the app hasn’t said reviewed yet so i’m not sure if i can use the money i’m so scared to use it cause i feel that i can get in trouble or might have to pay back i have used like  if not less to buy things here and there because i had  in there before he switched jobs so i’m not entirely sure if i can use the whole  or if i use it and end up having to pay back for the late change please someone help me get answers thank you
"new policy use it or lose it wv here got a letter from snap that was kinda confusing it said that the federal govt will be changing the rules for snap about accumulated benefits starting in september it said that any benefits not spent by nine months after they were issued will be removed 

so here is my question:  i’ve been on snap since  for multiple reasons including an eating disorder (recovered now) multiple hospitalizations plus being out of the state for several months i rarely used my full allotment each month i thought that that was a good thing that i was being frugal buying basic nutrition foods but not steaks or anything like that and had a “reserve” in case something happened and i needed to stock up that actually happened at the beginning of the pandemic and i bought $ worth of food in march of  and then was scared to go to the grocery store for several months so i didn’t use any more accumulated benefits during that time they kept being loaded on my card but i wasn’t spending them due to fear of covid 

anyway i am a single household one person and have accumulated about $ on my ebt card i typically spend about $ per month on food i’m grateful for these benefits  but i don’t make the rules they give me more than i can eat it’s just cuz i’m small and underweight and just can’t eat much

so if i didn’t spend all my allotment in may of  will they take all the excess benefits for that month away and so on till the present  will they take back all the benefits i got when i was afraid to go to the grocery store during the first few months of the pandemic i guess i can understand that but i’m sad that i was so careful and frugal buying rice and beans and canned soup to “save up” food funds for a rainy day or emergency like the pandemic and now i’m going to maybe forfeit it alldarn it i could have bought better foodbut it feels wrong to buy expensive food on snap

will they claw all my reserve back come september"
"california- weird snap interview i was on snap last year didn’t do my renewal so it stopped redid the app and had my interview today 

between now and then i had a baby i am not in contact with the father- long story short i don’t know him don’t judge me my girlfriend (we live separately finances are not combined) is on his birth certificate- which i haven’t ordered yet i live with a roommate we split rent and utilities do not share food one room each 

well during my interview the person asked me for my sons birth certificate and i told her i hadn’t ordered it she said he would be disqualified then i told her that was fine he is only  months she then asked about the father i told her i didn’t know him she then asked if he pays child support i again told her i didn’t know him she then told me i’m approved pending my sons birth certificate and income verification 

i guess i’m confused i’m fine with him not being included i just need food for me i told her i didn’t have it and she said i need to order it 

is this standard i’m not asking for him to be included in my “household” i’m not looking for extra money for food i also am not interested in going after the father for child support he’s not even on the bc someone else is we will eventually do a second parent adoption 

what are my options here do i have to provide his bc even if he’s disqualified she wouldn’t explain much and was pretty accusatory"
"fraud question again **update*** i was finally able to reach my investigator i was right that she was just super busy and that’s why it took so long she was so nice and made me feel much better our bonuses may not even matter she said but if they do we can go on a payment plan if necessary she said right now with pandemic stuff all of these kinds of issues are being labeled as unintentional errors or something like that  i feel so much better and i’m no longer getting physically sick from worry thanks to everyone who gave advice on this thread and my other one 

hi again i posted not too long ago about being under investigation for fraud i was very confused as to why and then i realized it was because i completely forgot to report income we earned in  it’s all in my previous post but to recap: we made very little in  and got on fs january  in  my husband earned a few bonuses through work for his sales numbers they put us around k over in gross income for the year i just didn’t even think to report it because i’m apparently an idiot and i continued to use our card for monthly groceries once i knew we were under investigation i went through everything i submitted and our financials and that’s when i realized my dumb mistake 
i’ve called the investigator several times but she won’t call me back i’m sure she’s very busy but i feel so sick to my stomach the kicker is that we received a lot of money each month because of the pandemic i didn’t use all of it but i did cover all of our groceries each month with the extra pandemic allotment (around $ a month) so i probably owe thousands back for the whole year of  i still have about k on the card but i haven’t been using it even though our income went back down i just want to close the card out completely 
my question is should i just go to my local dcfs office and tell them i realize that i messed up and didn’t report income i really want to make this right and i’m terrified of criminal charges because of the amount of fs i used i’m sorry if this post is redundant but my anxiety is through the roof i am absolutely terrified i have a newborn and other kids and the thought of going to jail is horrifying i’ve never even received more than a traffic ticket before i’m hoping they let us use the child tax credit money to just pay it all back i am so sick to my stomach over this am i going to go to jail

eta: just for clarification the bonuses were not monthly income but a quarterly thing it wasn’t like he got a permanent raise (at that time- he did in march  but our case closed then and we stopped receiving benefits then)"

"[ca] new calfresh card is suspended but i think i know why does this make sense hi -- i think i know what's happening here but hopefully someone can let me know if whether i'm on the right track or not

a while back i applied for calfresh things took forever but apparently i was approved no card or confirmation that approval came in the mail i only found out today when i called for the rd time and waited on hold again for another  minutes i was stoked they told me i could go up to my county office and pick up my snap card so i went and got it i logged into the account website and it showed benefit deposits for calfresh great

i went to test out the card and sure enough it didn't work i called customer service who told me that the card was suspended a 💡 light 💡 went off in my head and suddenly i remembered the weird letter i got from them a few weeks ago saying that no one had used my account and it was being suspended i can't find that letter now i think i ripped it up and threw it away in a fit frustration and confusion at the time it just pissed me off since i didn't have a card

apparently they thought i already had a card why i've never had calfresh before all this time i could have been using my food stamps instead of burning hundreds of precious dollars on groceries dollars i instead could have been using to pay my insanely high rent we could have been actually having meals instead living on cereal and pretzels and cheap pasta for the past  weeks anyhow hopefully this is behind us

**does this make sense and will a quick trip back to the county office get my card re-activated tomorrow morning**

**update -- update -- update -- update**

so i went to the county office this morning and they told me that the card wasn't suspended and that i should go try again i went home and logged back into [ebtcagov]( but nothing has changed

i noticed something though for the past transactions that suspended the card (account aged  status changed etc) it says ""card"" for the recent transactions including this morning's benefit deposit it says ""card"" with no last four digits my new card number ends in  that doesn't seem right

so here's my new question: **given these findings is it possible that they've neglected to attach my new card (the  one) to my account after suspending the old one**

**last update -- last update -- last update -- last update**

i called them back and waited another  minutes on hold **i was right** my newly issued card wasn't attached to the case the phone agent spent about  minutes fixing the account and presto -- my balance is now way more than $ i'm so excited with today's deposit we now have  months of calfresh benefits to stock our empty kitchen with

**for those who run into a problem like this in the future** be sure to check the food transaction list (again at [ebtcagov]( where there are entries such as ""benefit avail"" in blue text click on the entries to reveal another line that says ""card:xxxx"" the xxxx is the last four digits of the card it was applied to if you don't see a number like in my case or you see the wrong number there then the benefits aren't being applied to the correct card another clue was the food balance which read $ once everything is linked up correctly on their end the correct balance is shown and a few new adjustment transactions are listed with a reference to the correct card number

i hope this post helps someone else solve the same problem someday

thanks again /r/foodstamps"

new: walmart now accepts snap for regular shipping not just store pickup and delivery and shipping is free for orders over $ this makes online grocery shopping with snap very similar between amazon and walmart amazon's minimum for free shipping is only $ or $ for amazon fresh while walmart has free shipping on orders over $ and prices are lower than amazon on many items (amazon also offers prime at half price for snap recipients) i noticed this change very recently now that walmart has merged its online grocery shopping with the rest of its online shopping i haven't seen any announcement about it yet

"ohio: reporting new jobs/increased income but no actual paycheck yet spouse started a new job as an adjunct instructor on / that will likely put us over the limit for assistance i’m in ohio i only have a letter verifying the semester salary but not actual paycheck amount per month because his paycheck won’t come in until closer to the end of this month (administrative issues at the university) ebt card says september benefits already authorized so will i at least be able to use those i’m just stressed because we aren’t actually getting any paychecks yet but i know we need to report it by the th anyway i guess my question is are they going to cut us off immediately or are they going to give us a grace period until the first paycheck actually comes in

"snap benefits to increase in october – what will an increase mean for you hi my name is john puterbaugh and i’m a journalist with nextadvisor the personal finance section of time ( i’m working on a story about the snap benefits increase that is set to take effect next month ( the increase is expected to be about $ per person per month on average

i am hoping to learn from current snap recipients how much of an impact an increase like this would make for your monthly grocery budget along with that perspective the main goal of the story is to spread awareness of the increase and share information on how people can locate and sign up for assistance in their own communities (with snap and other programs)

if anyone is willing to share their thoughts with me please reach out to me here or directly via email: john@nextadvisorcom"

what should i put for ""percentage owned by joint owner"" in this instance my first thought is to put % but i don't know if the people reading the application would consider them a % owner since they have full access to the account

i like to eat a lot of organic vegetables and use my juicer so its difficult to try and find grocery delivery options that take the ebt card i normally use my snap benefits at amazon fresh and their selection sucks so i'd prefer signing up for a weekly fresh produce box subscription (support for our local farmers) but i don't think any of these subscription produce box services accept the ebt card does anyone know

*if they really cared about everyone staying healthy then we would have the option to use our ebt cards at many (or all) of these organic grocers but instead you can fill up your carts with cheese balls frozen pizzas and sour sugar treats because all of that garbage is accepted with your snap benefits with no questions asked your health starts with the food you eat*"

when being interviewed the woman asked if we prepared food together i told her no at first and had put no on my application and i explained to her our situation of paying for half each (which could technically count as just buying our own) and she then made me put him down as well which is what made me not qualify she kept wording the question weirdly and asked me a few times how/if we prepare food together and asked if we ever shared i basically said ""kind of only ever once in a while"" and then she had me give his info as well   


does anyone know if i can reapply and just say a straight up ""no"" to the sharing food question or do they have my name down on file as someone who doesn't qualify and will instantly be denied"

"trouble with food snap case just to give some back ground we’re in texas my mother has been receiving food snaps all last year and into the present and has already done the renewal twice once for the original date in feb  and a second time in april  for when the dates were extended to may  because of the winter storms it was in review for the longest it’s still in review right now 

now i understand that the offices are backed up so i waited then i called to check in june when she didn’t receive her monthly snaps i was then told that her amount dropped from her usual amount of $ to $  so they can’t give her partial benefits which is why she didn’t receive a deposit of regular or max allotment they escalated the case said to wait a week to check back 

so i waited and called basically the same info was given to me by a different rep but then it was said an interview was missed when they called which was frustrating because i waited by the phone and answered all unknown numbers and also expected to see the typical interview number 

 the second rep said she’s still approved for snap so she helped set up complaint  for the case for the amount and a call back fast forward to this week they’re saying she is approved for snap but may need to send a renewal in if she hasn’t already… which there’s no way todo it online again since it’s been sent in already and still shows “in review” wheni call and go through all the prompts they’re still giving outdated information about verification from

"implementation of hot food restrictions hi  i'm trying to get a sense of how the hot food restrictions play out on the ground and am wondering if people could share their experiences

i'm particularly interested in some of the areas where the rules are potentially unclear and may in practice depend on how the store programs their registers  for example are cold rotisserie chickens allowed  what about salad bars within a grocery store  is hot soup rejected  what about gazpacho from the same soup bar  is there something that you're sure was eligible that was rejected

in transparency i work for an advocacy organization and we'd love to include some of these examples in our work  i will not quote you directly unless you explicitly give permission  feel free to message me directly if you have questions or concerns

thank you"
i’m self employed and got form in mail to recertify i’ve been receiving fs for  months i uploaded required paperwork and got a call today last month my bills exceeded my income and they asked how i paid bills when income was not enough  i told them i had to use a credit card they have requested now my credit card statement plus a copy of the front and back of my credit card i feel uncomfortable giving my credit card information
"i'm not on food stamps but i just wanna ask if what my company is having us do is legal so i work for a company that will not be named  we have cold and hot sandwiches cold can be purchased with ebt food stamps but hot food cannot  our new rm is asking us to sell the food cold to those with ebt and then cook it for them in order to boost cold food sales  i'm just wondering if this is legal as it's unlawful in my state to sell hot food using ebt and this seems like it's gonna get us in trouble especially given how we have  regular customers who literally work for the unemployed office and get a hard on from reporting unlawful use of ebt food stamps

my boyfriend goes to college and i'm currently getting about  in ebt and while it usually covers everything the recent price hike of everything has made it so that the dollar or so more cost of everything has us cutting it very close i went so long without claiming him and i didn't want to if i didn't need to but all of our meals are shared so i figure he should qualify

my concern though is that through the university he goes to there is cash assistance in the form of student loans and i don't know all the details but what is the best way to go about claiming him if he's too busy to have a meeting to talk about what he does get should i talk to a social worker or someone that handles the benefits i don't even need like a big boost i just need a slight bump but i also don't really know how to actually claim him because if they ask me about what he gets from the school i have no idea so i also don't want to get in trouble

anyway that's not why i'm scared

i went through the process on the phone and i live with my boyfriend but we share no finances and i don’t really pay rent or anything and i told them this i assume i have to update when we get married as were now engaged but i want to make sure i’m not penalized for this has anyone else gone through this we don’t share much in the way of food he’s vegan and i have celiac and a host of problems food wise so it’s even more difficult to get food on a small budget leftover from my near non existent savings i also don’t receive unemployment (our system was broken during the height of covid so i just gave up) but i do know in most cases this doesn’t matter to dhs anyway just looking for advice"
phone interview mistake my mom applied for food stamps last week and was phoned in for an interview today she was asked if i went to college/are a student and she said yes; the problem is that she mistook my online certification classes that i've been taking for community college/university classes and was vehemently asked to bring a financial award letter asap or else the case would be cancelled obviously the problem here is that i do not have a financial award letter because i'm not attending any college－ just an online career school i'm not sure on what to say or bring now we really need the money right now and i'm afraid this slight error will get her whole case thrown away
forgot to update change of income panicking i lost my job then suddenly in the middle of moving got a new one completely forgot to update my income for calfresh / food stamps and am freaking out what will happen to me
"college phe waiver expiration sc hi there

a couple of months ago i was approved for snap under the efc= waiver as a college student and i am wondering what will happen when it comes time to recertify unfortunately i don't think i would qualify under the non-covid guidelines mainly since i am not working hrs/week

from how i understand it (based on [this memo]( the covid phe expires may  which means any recertification until june  will still qualify for the efc= waiver is this the right math then benefits would continue for either  months to  year after that recertification

this is all a little confusing so i appreciate any guidance"

can you have too much $$ on your ebt card hi i'm a senior (not the high school kind 😉) in fresno ca i applied for calfresh in july  and was approved i got paperwork saying i was approved but since i had missed my interview i didn't realize the benefits were already being applied to my card and they began piling up it was a couple months before i started using them and i am using them now and am grateful i did just get a notice of termination due to income limits although nothing has changed but i  really just wonder since there's still a rather high balance on my card that they would terminate my benefits for that i only shop every couple weeks and just don't spend a lot thanks for any advice

"any way to submit forms to dpss without having to call (los angeles ca) i had cash benefits stolen off my ebt card and need to submit a request for reimbursement (unfortunately this is the second time it's happened so i already know the process) my question is with the new [benefitscalcom]( website it seems like every time i upload anything i still need to call customer service or else no one ever sees it with the old ""ybn/your benefits now"" dpss site i never had to talk to anyone on the phone - documents that i uploaded whether they were requested or not always got processed now even when i talk to them and they specifically ask me to upload something they tell me to call back again after i do so and let them know

to me it completely defeats the purpose of uploading stuff online if i still need to deal with the customer service phone line hassle so i'm wondering if anyone knows a way to get things to them (and into the processing pipeline) without having to call if i were to mail the forms in would that work or is the only way to avoid calling by just going to the office in person thanks"

"i feel like eating healthy w/ food stamps is impossible for me i am disabled and as a result cannot cook due to my symptoms it would both be unsafe and result in a massive symptom increase 

because of this i rely mostly on microwave meals aside from a once a week meal train thanks to a local church i am very blessed to get 

but unlike getting bigger amounts of ingredients and creating meals relying on microwave meals becomes extremely expensive i have a care shift for four hours every week and they’re allowed to do meal prep but usually their shift is already almost overtime by just completing the cleaning laundry and shopping i need help with i’ve tried to request more time but right now there’s such a shortage for healthcare workers that that hasn’t been successful 

i really want to eat healthy but unhealthy microwave meals are already $ish dollars a piece maybe more maybe less and the quality ones are typically all the way up to $-

does anybody have ideas on how to eat healthy w food stamps 

thankfully i’m very fortunate to have the maximum benefit of $ but i’m still struggling quite a bit i’m also struggling because often times the easiest way for me to get a fresh meal is meal delivery because i can’t drive but meal delivery doesn’t accept ebt so that racks up wildly quickly with my virtually inexistent income 

any and all ideas greatly appreciated thank you so much

"can i use extra food stamps money to make a food donation to a local charity *colorado usa*

i receive monthly food stamps normally i receive $ a month but because of covid i’ve been getting an additional $ monthly for a few months i wasn’t getting the $ like i was supposed to and then all of a sudden i got the  months i would have gotten all at once 

so i have quite a lot of funds in food stamps right now and i haven’t been feeling well these past couple weeks so i’ve pretty much been on a liquid nutrition drink diet and not going through the food stamps super quickly 

my friend works at a local charity packing bags for deployed military- and her birthday is coming up next month i looked into it and the charity allows for donations of specific food items and money and since i can’t donate in money i was thinking i could maybe use my snap benefits to purchase some food to donate 

is this allowed

"purposefully let food stamp expire was considered disabled didn’t want to share roomate information if i start working this month and get a w soon after could they down the road audit and/or investigate me demand further info or give trouble i just wanna be done with food stamps long story short i was let go from my job for chronic anxiety affecting my job performance  was denied ssdi ect

i started food stamps and got a little more than  a month 
i had a doctors work release for my disability and a letter from roommate stating they help me with bills(a dear friend indeed)

all was normal  
then i and roomate moved and they sent a form called “requesting info” or something like that  the form saying basically “how are you making money to pay rent”

i was a bit perplexed because i had already stated i wasn’t working and the roommate letter stated they help me with rent and i would pay them back at a later time

the answer the form required seemed to be a “black and white” kind of answer  where as the reality was more complex
felt like anything i said could be construed as dishonest
so i got overwhelmed and simply never responded

(my condition can give me anxiety where i am practically shaking and have difficulty concentrating also)

so march i simply didn’t renew my food stamps on purpose  i let them expire  

i also decied i am going to work part time somewhere this summer and will likely have a w this year

my questions are:

is my case simply dormant yet not closed  or is it closed its says “denied” on the website account

since i simply left my case without renewing it nor responding to the form (and will have a w soon enough)

 could i get audited or investigated down the road  or will they simply let it remain expired and forget about all of it

(or if i reapplied down the road could they say “ok we proof of info still” or possibly audit/investigate me then)

i honestly want to be done with food stamps and get back on my feet
i likely won’t be contacting them reapplying or anything

if anyone can clarify this i would be grateful"

"ohio snap (food stamps) question my boyfriend was approved for expedited food stamps/short term medicaid in ohio on the rd of may because he doesn't work he will need to go to meetings that assist with finding jobs in order to be approved his first is the th of june he has yet to submit proof of my income our rent and other bills etc but that isn't due until the st of june which will be when they determine if his benefits will continue

his medicaid proof already came a few days ago but no snap card yet and it's been  business days we are wondering whether his card will come in the next few business days or if they're waiting for him to go to this first meeting or turn in his verification i don't think this is the case because they stated multiple times that he was approved for expedited benefits and when we called the automated system stated that his benefits were active and his balance was what they told us it would be 

i'm posting because i'm curious if other people have been approved for expedited food stamps in ohio or other states whose programs are similar and whether the meetings/proof are required beforehand or if you received your card in the mail before all of this about how long did it take for you to receive the card i believe it said - business days for expedited benefits to arrive but it feels so much longer when you are hungry and broke"

not one person i have spoken to over the years has been able to explain the math they use to arrive at the amount a person is awarded i have spoken to a couple of representatives who had a little empathy but the majority really don't give a crap $ a day doesn't seem like much and the price of cat food has doubled so that isn't even an option the additional monies given during the beginning of the pandemic was a godsend it would make sense to increase the amount awarded now that prices on food products have almost doubled i guess the florida government is busy with more important things like naming strawberry shortcake our state dessert"

"when to report a change of new income but under % of federal poverty lev florida resident  i'm confused on when a change must be reported do we report a new job even if the income is less than the % threshold of the federal poverty level  the site says something about able bodied adults having to work  hours per month but what happens if  hours are all the employer will give

i don't know if it is  me or the language is just  confusing  on purpose but if you don't have to report until a certain amount is exceeded it seems like the job has to be reported anyway so they can track hours  iks this correct   can someone explain like i am  
i feel like you all would have a better answer then if i posted on that site
thanks"

"texas deductions  kids under  citizen boyfriend (father of kids) i don’t qualify because i have daca

he makes  before taxes and bills our rent based on the lease is $ not including utilities he also pays $ on back child support each month because he stopped working during the pandemic usually he’d be paying $ they only deducted $ from rent and only counted $ from the child support they gave us $ in food stamps which we’re still grateful for

what other bills can i upload is hhs taking long to review any updated uploads and how do deductions work how could they deduct so little on what we pay

and i know abbott approved emergency food stamps in texas for june but the provider’s app hasn’t updated this on the announcements i always trusted them but idk if maybe they know something more i haven’t received it yet either i know it’s going to come between june th-june th i’ve been approved since april 

also i broke my card on sunday and ordered a replacement monday (since you have to talk to an actual rep to cancel the card now) will i still get my funds deposited i’m probably going to be seen as paranoid but let’s say i get funded today but it won’t show on ytb but once i create a new pin number for it it’ll show up is that possible

"florida: are children who turn  and finish high school automatically removed from benefits or do i need to submit a change hi florida resident here  my daughter recently turned  and just finished her senior year of high school i am assuming i need to submit a change now but wonder if they will automatically remove her since they know all of this information already

also i have read some posts where it seems their  y/os are still listed in the household if going to college  do they still get food stamp benefits then  if she moves away for school  is she then removed from the household all together  what if she stays in the home but no longer has meals with us

she wants to get a job this summer but will it affect the benefits of the rest of the household 

sorry to ask so many questions but i hope someone can help clarify any and all important information regarding  year olds  thank you"

"caregiver question about workforce (tx) last year my husband's physician filled out a form that states that i am his main caregiver and cannot work outside the house it took forever and a day (about  months) for them to accept the paper but once they did workforce stopped sending me letters

that is until yesterday i got a notice that i am required to attend their next meeting on the th

from my understanding once the physician filled that paper out and it was accepted that was it i don't have anything from health and human services stating i need to fill anything else out no additional paperwork is required

so what do i tell workforce when i call them on monday should i remind them that i have this approval or do i need to have them send another paper for my husband's physician to fill out for this year

"from a tx worker we apologize for the extremely long wait in your cases we understand and that's why we are working long hours and saturdays to cover this this isn't a sermon its a plea for our applicants to help us

our goal is to finish your application the first time we see it but its difficult when there are so many blanks in the application and there are no verifications provided with the applications/renewals we are spending too many days trying to plug in missing information that should already be with the application and this was never an issue before those are weeks we could have used to process thousands of new applications

*always* provide verification of your id address income rent/mortgage child care and past due bills with your application employers and landlords rarely disclose information to us

provide  representative check stubs from the last  days that include your name your employer's name gross income hours and pay date *please no screenshots of your direct deposit or your payroll app that doesn't show names*

if you are self employed keep your earnings tracked on a calendar you can submit the previous  complete months or the last  pay dates if you are paid weekly biweekly or semi-monthly if you have a fixed schedule if your boss pays you in cash or personal check with no deductions have them write it and always date and sign this

you get help for rent utilities child support toiletries etc get verification of how they help you  amount of how much they give you or pay for you and how often they help you have them sign date and put a phone number if you are past due provide your bills

it is rare when we deviate from this list of requirements  sometimes all we need is proof of your address and it gets to us when that's all we need and we won't come back because we have to continue with the other applicants

"snap sar households good afternoon

the following question applies to snap only as ma has different reporting requirements 

this is little bit of a different type of topic that normally occurs on this subreddit however pennsylvania has changed its administrative ruling on its sar policy

previously all households enrolled in sar or non had to respond to any request from the office (example: caseworker receives a new hire hit sends request for information either adjust the income when received or closed when not received)

pennsylvania has changed its stance on this and is now changing to a % requirement like most other states so while the caseworker will still send the request for information if the info is not received they will only close the medical and not the snap if it is a snap sar household (during non-phe times)

since i've worked for the state we have not done reporting this way so my question to the eligibility experts here is this: 

*a household is enrolled in sar with an application date of / and a new hire hit is received in february information request is not returned and at sar in june the household reports not working on sar form 

what would a caseworker do (correctly) in this situation policy does not address and a sar does not require an interview"

i recently reapplied for snap (il) and confused because when i got my new card and checked my balanc it's much higher than i expected $ more

my benefit amount is $ monthly our local office is closed so everything has to be done over the phone it takes forever to talk to a person and historically sometimes i've gotten misinformation from them trying to extract accurate info from them about this balance might be futile or create even more problems

i already receive medicaid and have been for a long time i'm worried that if i spend this money i'm going to get in trouble and it will affect my medicaid somehow i'm also confused because the balance on the card went down $ from one day to the next with no explanation why why is my current balance so high yet also decreased since

ok so i find the card i call for the balance it says  i go back and request a new card since my old one was closed the worker yea and ok me i wait to be called to pick the new card up and this worker ask am i replacing my card or getting a new one i said”getting a new one”she hands me the card and i don’t even think to look at it i was just happy to be heading to a clean safe quiet place to sleep and i pull the card out and it’s the same card i still ignored that and assumed maybe they just kept my card number the same i call  balance  i go online it shows the old card had gotten a deposit and then they canceled it and i see a second card with the balance of what i should have gotten but the status says closed and i also notice in the details the last  of the card number is different then the one i was issued 

i haven’t slept in two days and i sit in my car devastated as i write this on a saturday morning which means the office is closed until monday no money for gas or food or anywhere to stay all because i got my card at closing time and the worker didn’t care to make sure she gave me the correct card im guessing she realized she gave me the wrong card after i left and just closed the card this could have been prevented but these people don’t care about you at all

 i've taken off work and waited by the phone but no one calls

each time i call in on my scheduled day when their call doesn't come and wait -hrs on hold to be told that my only option is to reschedule 

i've been told that no one who answers these calls is allowed to complete my phone interview the next available appointment is always at least  week away

there is no such thing as a face to face appointment

no one at the physical office in my county can complete my interview

"california calfresh admin error overpayment notice hello

i received a notice today saying that due to an administrative error they overpaid me for june  when i called the office they said that i received this notice because it was too late to stop my june payment distribution after i reported a change in income

the office said that they would have to send an email to their supervisor to send to the district office to ask if they could subtract the money from my current balance

my question is has anyone ever been in this situation and had their request denied or approved 

i'd prefer if they deducted the june payment from my current or future ebt payment (my last payment should have been in may and it is confirmed that there is no july payment) rather than mail them a check for the amount that i don't foresee myself using

if anyone has had experience with this (either approved or denied for taking it out of their ebt funds) or have knowledge of how the system works in california that would be great

thank you"
"spent more than remaining snap balance question i am in california

i had $ left on my snap balance and i went grocery shopping and spent $

i thought it would charge only up to the $ remaining snap balance and ask me to pay the remainder in cash/creditcard/etc but it somehow paid the whole thing and even says now i have $ remaining snap balance

i read something about calfresh snap emergency allotments for $ but i already had the maximum amount for my household size of one for $ month

i did the math and added $ to my $ remaining balance from my last receipt and subtracted the $ and it comes to exactly the amount it says i have remaining now of $ so i guess you do get the $ emergency allotment even if you already had the maximum monthly amount for your household size is that what's going on here i guess so"

() the name of the agency granting the public benefit;
() the type of benefit; and
() an indication that the benefit is currently being received (for example a recently dated letter or document

"ca - calfresh overissuance notice scared of additional oversight from calfresh hello all

i applied for food stamps in california orange county right before coronavirus hit (march) and was approved at the time i was paying $ in rent per month but when coronavirus got bad i moved to santa clara county and began paying $ in rent per month i reported the change to my case worker in orange county at the time who told me that my case would be transferred to santa clara county the necessary paperwork would be filled out regarding my housing cost changes and any additional needed information would be requested by santa clara county when the time came i followed up with santa clara county soon after and was told again that any necessary information would be requested from me if there were issues

when i was approved in santa clara county for calfresh i called in again as i was confused as to why my benefit amount wasn't significantly different worrying that i illegitimately qualified for too much and was told that all of my benefits were legitimate i fully qualified for them and i shouldn't worry

months later i applied for unemployment benefits and was approved and began collecting unemployment in july i backdated my unemployment claim to april receiving all $ of my benefits from april-july in the month of july i immediately contacted my calfresh case worker when i began collecting unemployment and was told to simply list my new income in my sar  i would be filling out in august

fast forward to now after following all the steps provided to me by my case workers and i receive a calfresh overissuance notice stating i owe $ to santa clara county that was overissued from // to // i expected this but what worried me far greater was that under section i: shelter deductions from part  - net income eligibility on the notice of action my total housing cost was still listed as $ for june and july on top of that despite making above my irt from unemployment my snap benefits were only reduced by about % instead of being cancelled completely

i am worried that an administrative error was made despite the numerous times i reported the housing cost change and followed up with both orange county and santa clara county and i might owe a much more significant amount of money from overissuance i contacted my case worker immediately by email but have yet to receive a response and would like some clarity and advice from anyone who experienced a similar situation or might know more about these kinds of issues

"can i get food stamps on ssi (sorta) in california so i recently quit my job working with a non-profit that hires disabled people (health reasons) my final day there will be march th it just so happens that in march i will be getting  paychecks which will reduce my ssi benefits to zero in may my question is because i will be getting just ssdi for the month of may and no ssi benefits (but still technically on ssi) can i get food stamps for that month

​

i just really know may will be tight as hell financially and i am doing my best to budget for it but it would really be a great help if i could get food stamps for may

​

i hope it doesn't seem like i am milking the system i'm just looking for way not to go deeper in debt

thanks"

edit: i called the number waited  minutes and a representative told me basically ) i don't need to interview because they were easily able to see household wages from their online system (meaning there were no wages that didn't show up for some reason) and that i don't need to report a change until the -month mark (""simplified reporting"") and ) whoever approved my application forgot to send out a card so they've sent it out now and it should only take - biz days for it to get here in addition the pin gets sent  days after the card for security"

"[ca] penalty for reporting income change late i'm a full-time grad student in la county married and currently not working a paying job i applied for food stamps on oct  when both my husband and i were both unemployed the approval process took over a month it wasn't until the middle of november that i was approved also around the same time my husband started working again but when i spoke to dpss he was still on unemployment what he makes now exceeds the income threshold

the information about reporting income change within  days came through the mail and since this was during the back half of the quarter my brain was pretty checked out so the mail piled up a bit and i didn't have a chance to go through it until earlier this week so a few questions:

-am i going to get dinged for reporting this late because we didn't receive the card until a couple weeks ago the amount we've used is still from the money they put on there for the month of october when we both unemployed the notice of approval says the certification period covers //-//

i assume they will just remove the funds that they have placed there for this month and part (all) of november since this was my first time applying for ebts i really didn't realize we had to report the income change (i had only read about needing to re-certify after a certain point)

) husband is going to be out of work for the next two weeks (he works in film/tv and the production he's on is shutting down for the holidays) after which he will be back with his current income do/can i report this too and if so when should i do i need to wait until this coming monday when he is not working

) within the next  months if i report income change that goes above the irt now but then later experience a decrease in income do i need to reapply again or will my case still be open

) what is the best way to contact dpss to report the income change i'm having trouble finding info about doing it online and the info i got says either call them or report it in writing (but no further directions about how to report in writing)

"florida resident w/roommates application help there are a few aspects to my situation that are somewhat atypical and make the application process very confusing here's a rundown of what i'm dealing with:

there's also another guy that rents a room

each of our finances is completely separate we don't share meals etc i'm the only one applying

thank you for taking the time to read this i've called dshs a few times to get this clarified but i'm paranoid to say the least 

long story short i completed my recertification earlier this month and i went from $ a month to $ they told me that if maximum emergency benefits are approved i should continue to get the max amount but once that expires we no longer receive benefits now i would normally take what they say at face value but i'm not confident and i'm hoping to hear from someone in my situation that has received benefits with a $ amount approved my case appears to be active and per the state website it makes mention of households approved for $ receiving the full amount but i guess i need reassurance to really feel secure in this answer i know it's silly but life has been very difficult for us(like many of us) and these benefits have been a life saver for us

"venting roommate lied on his snap application &amp; did fraud and now uses all his ebt to buy soda and red bull my roommate who never once paid rent as agreed (can't evict yet due to covid law) got food stamps about  weeks ago  he lied on his application  he told them that he was making his own food and buying it separately so that his app wouldn't be based on his other roommates' wages if he used our info on the application he'd have been denied  he marked down that for the past  months he's been buying his own food  thus  he got retro pay  it was a lie 

 he never once cooked or bought food my other roommates and i fed him  meals per day plus snacks and drinks he never once bothered to help cook or clean after eating 

i told him  weeks ago that he needs to contact our county's welfare board and explain that he will not be using the retro pay  as it's illegal but that he could still use future snap as long as he didn't share food with us  he had replied that he doesn't care if he goes to jail i explained that he put me in a bad spot he only thinks of himself   how about the fact that now i have this weighing on my mind that he was stealing from those who needed it and that he got retro pay that he banked off of when the ""retro"" reality was actually all my money spent on him

so  i reported him to snap  i don't really feel bad i even warned him that i would be reporting him if he didn't comply  he knew he was making me feel uncomfortable  he also isn't starving  he spent all the back pay on convenience-store-purchased red bull and a ton of soda i'm talking about $ a day just on soda    granted he did buy a few banquet frozen dinners the bulk was candy bars  that's what he's eating all day   

how is it even legal that he can buy nothing but red bull and soda  he's clearly taking advantage of the system  how are there not ""caps"" on certain items surely  one does not need  cans of red bull per day  that's also bad on his heart and $/ day on nonsense  i understand you may think it's none of my business what he spends his ebt money on  but it sort of is   regardless  the snap program is broken  


 now he ran out of snap and expects to eat here like i'm gonna turn away a hungry person he knows i won't turn him away because i have a heart  but i'm enabling him he put me in a catch  preying on my weakness  he's soon to be legally evicted  as the courts here are finally starting to hear cases again after its ~ month hiatus

"texas benefits &amp; disability for my mom my mom is  years old and she has been essentially homeless for the past  years fortunately she has not been on the streets - she has been living and being supported by various family members - and she's not on drugs

she wants to be independent because living with family is not working for her (or us) and she's started the process of applying to receive disability benefits  
  
few questions:  
 how does her disability application process interact with other programs such as snap subsidized housing etc does she have to apply for these separately  
 she lives with my sister but we've never claimed her as a dependent or anything like that what does she answer for questions such as ""who is the head of the household""  
 what programs should she apply for that would get her closest to being able to have her own place we're happy to subsidize her as we've been doing this for a long time just want her to be happy"

"going over irt during the break [california] during the december break i'll be working for about - weeks back at home as the previous place i worked offered me to work for them whenever i am home for the holidays/major school breaks  but i will be over the irt for that month i anticipate -x that amount given the duration of my winter break i am using this opportunity to pay my tuition and housing out of pocket and reduce my loan for the quarter obviously after my housing &amp; tuition are paid my bank account will be pretty low on the first day of classes (second week of jan) however once i return back to school my irt will be back to &gt; per month again

i don't expect that large income to continue next month until the next break 

i do intend to report the income change within  days after i work the day i make over irt 

* i would like to know if they would cancel my benefits i'm a bit worried that i'll have my benefits cut given the amount and go through the process again 
* would i have to reapply for cal fresh again after winter break if that is the case i may have to work a little extra to buy food for a bit 
* what usually happens when you report going over irt what is also defined as a month for calfresh (is it like first of month to the first of the next month defined as one month)

this is for california calfresh program 

i qualify for the program as i have an efc of  live independently and i am working as a research assistant (paid) on my university campus (lpie)"
what are the work search requirements for ohio snap benefits i just applied for ohio medicaid and snap benefits i understand that there is a work or work search requirement but don’t understand what that entails the website wasn’t much help and i’m not clear on how that process goes and whether or not i’ll be able to actually choose the kind of work i want and need based on my prior education and experience plus i’ve been focused on remote/work-from-home positions because i live with disabled people (&amp; have asthma myself) and don’t want to get them or myself sick

my question for you guys - i have $ on my ebt card will it be available for me to use into next month or will it evaporate tonight at the end of the month it does show i was discontinued / so it did carry into october but i dont know if i should run to the store and do some massive shopping or if it will be here tomorrow any advice would be great searched the internet high and low and nothing on discontinued funds and where they go

"received my card last week then denied benefits (texas) hello i tried to search for this but couldn't quite find the same issue

tl;dr -- ebt card was received then a few days later i was told my application was rejected

i received my lone star ebt card early last week and i activated it awaiting the award letter except on friday i received an electronic letter that i was denied because i didn't report all the information they requested (worth noting: i confirmed i did in fact report everything they requested including a letter explaining what everything was since some of it is a bit confusing)

if it's worth noting i received two separate letters requesting more information -- one on october rd and one on october th i submitted all the information on october th

also maybe worth noting that i called after about  weeks from my application date and the woman was very kind and put my application in the expedited queue i am unsure if somehow i have a regular-pace application and an expedited-pace application out there

starting in  my snap started to decrease with reviews i’ve had - reviews or interviews in the last  years  last year alone and one formal one just this month i’m on ssi &amp; ssdi due to my father being disabled which i get a total of $/mo to live off

when my amount changed from $/mo to $/mo last year i called &amp; asked why they said it was because i don’t pay rent or a mortgage the rest of the year the amount has slowly gone up to $/mo this year this month though i had a formal review with paperwork and am now awarded $/mo i know they’re switching to a new computerized system but hot damn that’s so little for someone on disability

"pandemic supplemental issuances for april and ongoing - megathread **edit** - i'll update this or leave a stickied comment at the top as things change - i suspect there may be more changes coming

**edit **: as suspected the number of states has changed look for this trend to continue  as it's evident the feds are updating one state at a time 

**edit  for june **:  due to guidance from the feds if you have a *calculated benefit amount* of **$** you will no longer be receiving any additional ea benefits this likely means that you've been receiving the max like everyone else and will now get nothing i suggest calling your elected representatives in dc if you're exercised about this  as imo it's kind of a shitty thing to do to people 

---

understandably we're getting a lot of questions about this topic at the moment - this thread is intended to stem the tide a bit so please keep commentary and questions on this topic here for the time being

**what we know**:  ~~as of /~~ per the federal [food &amp; nutrition services page]( ~~~~ many states have been approved for the emergency allotment waiver  i will hazard a guess that there are more in the pipeline but because these waivers are granted at the state's request on a monthly basis this is obviously subject to change on a state-by-state basis

[guidance from fns as of //]( indicates that fns is expanding benefits for those states still in an emergency status to increase allotments up to $/mo for those households that have received less than a $/mo increase from the emergency allotment waiver thus far

because these changes will require additional updating of the data systems used to support snap issuance it is possible even likely that some delays in the timing of these benefit implementation dates will occur  again because this is managed at the local agency level what state or county you live in will be highly relevant in answering those questions - please understand that agencies are getting this information at nearly the same time that the public is being informedso they may or may not have answers in the moment

**going forward there will be a moratorium on separate posts to the subreddit on this topic to avoid flooding**  while i can appreciate the continued stress over changes on this subject i've also had to take down a higher than usual amount of inappropriate posts and comments in reply to posts and that isn't serving anyone well  if you have a question/questions on your particular state and you haven't found it elsewhere make it a top-level comment here and we'll do our best to help

**please** read and refer to the following links before asking questions

"(texas) daughter suddenly cut off from foodstamps hello all like the title says i’m in texas and my daughter got her food stamps cut off she was just approved in march it’s her her  month daughter and her  year old fiancé on their case they have had this case since last august with a  month lapse in foodstamps because she forgot to renew covid came thru hours got slashed so she re-applied got approved but then her march benefits weren’t put on her card until  days before her april benefits were loaded and she never received the covid amount for their family size for that month april everything loaded when it was supposed to may she did not receive the full amount for her family size just the amount she would normally receive  then comes june where parents in texas were told they’d get an extra $ (or whatever the number what) for school aged children apparently her fiancées mother applied to get that $ for him mind you he has not lived with her since february of  he has lived with my daughter my daughter supported him until he graduated this year 

my daughter never received anything stating she would no longer receive benefits has not been called by anyone but it’s now july rd and her benefits should have been loaded on the th and when she calls it says no deposit is pending she updated her case to let them know in may she was let go from her job and that her fiancée got a new job better pay but half the hours (they worked at same place before and they were about to lay him off as well) 

it gets complicated by the fact that they rent a home from her fiancées parents (yes they pay full rent and all utilities including ones that other tenants aren’t required to pay and have never missed a payment) i’ll also add that his parents claimed him as a dependent on their  taxes despite the fact that they did not support him in anyway (i support him more than they do to be perfectly honest) because “he was still in high school” 

how does she fix this

possible amazon snap items overpricing scheme doing some shopping on amazon i noticed many items that are snap eligible are marked up to ridiculous prices very likely due to being eligible for example you can get  nori sheets for $ but as soon as you click the button to show snap items the prices go way up and the quantity goes way down it's not just nori either that is just the latest example i have come across is this not illegal in some way

"welfare fraud consequences ****state of illinois

so i got a letter in the mail about a month ago saying i was being investigated for welfare fraud  a few years back i lost my job and was in the middle of medical treatment post surgery and had to apply for medicaid and eventually applied for snap  my fiance and son lived with me and i don't think i reported it because she claims him on taxes (i didn't technically have a dependant) and i considered myself as a separate household  

 snap interviewer asked about my income and i said it was very little as i can't work normally and only refinish and sell junk furniture  after i said that to my surprise she said that meant i was self employed and i'd have to submit ""business expenses"" and my monthly income  so i came up with a $ average amount  fast forward to this year  i had the welfare fraud investigator contact me saying that i was being investigated  on top of that my now wife got a letter sent to her new employer saying she was being investigated  on my last recertification this past december i listed my wife's job change and income and kept receiving benefits  the investigator said it was probably flagged because a caseworker overlooked my reported change  my worry is about not including my fiance in household income and my own (unreported cash income from furniture flipping here and there)

i'm reading all kinds of stuff about criminal charges and anything over $ in snap fraud being a felony with jail time  i'm a good guy and genuinely needed the help because of inconstant income and needing medical coverage but not able to afford it through my at the time fiance  so i got this letter a month after her new job offered her insurance so i went ahead and submit a cancel request to avoid anything further  but i'm freaking out waking up through the night with the thoughts of going to jail for this when i really needed it (although i didn't include certain information)  i'm sorry this is so long but i'm really worried  i'll gladly pay it back if i need to

to specify i only applied for myself and got $ a month in snap and then use of medicaid for some doctors appointments and whatnot - but nothing unnecessary  thank you so much if you've read this entire post  any advice"

"press inquiry for snap recipients hello r/foodstamps

i am a journalist currently investigating the thrifty food plan the basis for determining snap benefits which the usda has been ordered to re-evaluate this year 

in the time i've been in r/foodstamps i've seen that a common problem is that the funds for snap are unpredictable and inconsistent which makes it hard to budget month to month i'm interested in speaking to some of you about your experiences with snap especially if you are experiencing benefit inconsistencies or difficulties during or prior to the pandemic

i want to make sure i have a good understanding of how benefactors are affected by the current structure of the snap program and hearing some of your stories will help me be as accurate and helpful in my reporting as possible  

i don't want to take up space in a place designed to help with these problems so we have the conversation off of this thread the admins suggested a post to gauge interest would be the most appropriate action so here we are

let me know here or via dm if you are interested in a short conversation about your experiences in the next week or so i'd be happy to share personal info for verification off of the general thread looking forward to speaking with some of you"

so after applying july th  i upload all the documents they need called them twice to confirm that they have all they need and both people said i should be good i uploaded all the necessary documents to get qualified i wait and my status on the yourtexasbenefits site remained unchanged for nearly two weeks so i call them back at the end of july only to be told i have to wait till the th of august for them to either approve or deny me 

sooo i wait more august th comes and they deny me and my son for snap and medical as i was missing one document a letter i write stating i recieve no gifts or help paying bills i called and was told they give me another  days after denial to upload missing document for be reconsidered so then i write up the statement and upload it i waited a week and  and nothing changed on the yourtexasbenefits site still shows denied i call them to see how long it will take my son and i have been living off food pantries and neither have medical they tell mei have to wait till the th of september what

so i wait again the th of september comes and goes and my status still shows denied call them told i have to wait  days from the th of september and here i am today i have called them twice inbetween the th ofm september making sure thats all they need and they say yes

its now been  days past the th of september what is going on

is this normal having to wait this long for food or medical i have never had a issue especially getting my son medical in other states let alone having to wait months maybe a week tops

im unemployed and have no income i practically begged the lady asking if there was anything i can do to speed up the process so me and my son can eat something other than expired food and so i can get my son his medications there is no reason i shouldnt qualify or my son shouldnt either

"how to get case re-opened my case has been closed for about  weeks after a renewal after  weeks of constant friendly contact with my local dfacs (ga) my benefits have been reinstated i wanted to share how 

 upload and hand deliver requested documents in a timely manner
 make sure you get receipt via screen shot for uploaded documents and a receipt for hand deliveries 
 always remain polite and pleasant we are all humans and they have difficulties in life as well you will brighten their day with your optimism
 call and leave a message to your caseworker often if they haven't contacted you in a few days call their supervisor these are need based programs and many people apply so keep contacting them 
 go to the office  or call and confirm that the caseworker is available and see if the receptionist can set up an appointment for you to speak with your caseworker
 if you haven't received any letter or phone call contact the supervisor of the supervisor of your caseworker to let her know what's going on 
 i know it can be frustrating because we apply for these benefits because we are in need but remain polite friendly and always have proof for any income you receive so as to not have any delay in benefits
 many times in my area caseworkers make mistakes and close cases look over your paperwork for any inconsistencies and try to self-edit if your caseworker states any untrue info regarding what you sent in or that they didn't receive it kindly inform them of the receipts hopefully your case will be re-opened and you get the benefits your family needs good luck"

calfresh sar- question hello i’m in california and my sar- report was due by the th day in september which i filled out online on september  i heard nothing from them so i thought everything was okay then i received a notice on october  stating that my sar- report was incomplete and that i needed to upload the missing information that they are requesting by the first of the next month which was nov  or my calfresh would be discontinued so i went online and uploaded what they asked for on october  again i didn’t hear back so i thought everything was okay and then on november  which is when my ebt card is loaded my funds were not there so i called them the next day and spoke with a case worker and she reaffirmed me i was not at fault it was a problem on their end and i stayed on the phone while she said she was reprocessing my report with my uploaded documentation and she also said that she would expedite my funds my question is how long until my funds are loaded on my card because it’s been  days since my phone call to them if anyone can answer this for me i’d really appreciate it thank u

"can inform me about my options hello everyone about ca ebt rules and regulations due to the fact that i have been under my mom\\s case since i\\m guessing the start of the pandemic i'm trying to find information on whether or not if someone else is in the same circumstances that i am in i have called repeatedly to get my case separated in the state of california but i am repeatedly told i cannot separate my case because i'm under hers i don\\t understand because i have done this before the pandemic is this something that started when the pandemic came about or is it because of the pandemic relief extra money they have been allotting to people that is set to expire next month 

even so i still don\\t understand why that would prevent me from separating my case from hers my guess and this is only a guess is that it's easier for the county to not over allot extra payments to people but i find that ridiculous cause everything is in their system so they\\d be the ones controlling what's happening not me

&amp;#xb;

the reason i'm asking is because i am not on speaking terms with my mother and it\\s a very challenging process to even deal with her so for a while now i have not been going to her for cash aid instead relying on my stimulus payments it's a long story but basically i informed edd/dpss of this and they said they would send an escalation notice to the worker and within  business days i should hear back from them i made this call on a friday and checked back monday even though i was told they would call me no one answered so i managed to call back the rd day and finally got someone on the phone who informed me my case was\\t able to be separated (they gave no reason or said it was part of their rules) but they kept saying i could be separated but only by her which made me more confused because why 

&amp;#xb;

they guy who told me to just wait till benefits ran out next month then i could apply on my own sent the escalation ticket when i informed him she can be very confrontational and abusive so that is why i wasn't keen on asking for access from the card from her i promptly informed him i been using my own savings for food ( i know that might not matter because benefits were allotted to all of us i don\\t want the missing benefits i just want the case to be under my name so i don't have to use her card or go to her for those benefits that she's getting but i'm not even using for myself and yes it's fine if they restart my case with no money except for what\\s generally allotted)

&amp;#xb;

so once i informed him of this circumstance that's when he found it necessary to issue an escalation notice to the eligibility workers so i called and was told all of that basically and that i informed them i wanted my case separated but no one had called me yet so  she said she would submit it again for the second time but this time i noted she said i would have to keep up with them (i'm not foregoing the possibility the first guy told me that but i am strongly in belief that was not the case the first time around) so i said okay 

&amp;#xb;

i then asked some follow up questions i the event that would be denied anyways for whatever rules are in place i asked the person i was speaking with if it's possible to get a separate ebt card to use under her case instead of a replacement that way i could access the benefits to instead of going directly to her for the card 

&amp;#xb;

i was then told that it was an option unbeknownst to me at the time because no one had ever told me this before that the main case holder can do that by filling out a simple form that's available and submitting it to the office (what)

&amp;#xb;

you mean to tell me i could've had access to our benefits the entire time we were receiving them without having to go through the main case holder

&amp;#xb;

it still doesn't make sense why it\\s limited to her authorization only the only reason i could think of is because she was the main one that filed and claimed me at the time for being under her case  but even so it's ridiculous to tell me that i can't separate myself from her unless she wants it

&amp;#xb;

is it possible she made me out to be unable to care for myself and perhaps made it so that i wouldn't be able to separate myself i am not one to jump to conclusions like that so easily i am wondering if that's something edd/dpss does though because if so i had no idea of that status of myself while on her case nor did i ever authorize her to do something like that

&amp;#xb;

&amp;#xb;

so in simplicity all i'm asking is whether someone knows in depth about how the case are being affected right now due to the pandemic and if they know they are doing this for everyone is there a way around this i am in los angeles county by the way is anyone in similar situation what advice do you recommend to me

&amp;#xb;

note: please be kind and do not suggest i start talking to my mother it is a personal situation and i understand not everyone will understand (or care for that matter) but as of right now it is not an option unless absolutely necessary and the only two scenarios i can see something like that happening is if either:

 i inform her and request to be separated from her benefits case
 i ask her to fill out the secondary ebt card authorization form and submit it to tithe office so i can get my own card to use my portion of the benefits with

i\\d like to know if anyone is in a similar situation"
"michigan food assistance much less than i have been getting for the last decade or so tldr: screwed up didnt get reauthorization done in october got back on in january but monthly total is $ a month less income and monthly expenses didn't change

have been on food assistance for - years  always the max maybe a few months here and there with less but always corrected  approved for ssi  years ago max monthly payment housing is  total rent and utilities paid in one lump sum 

anxiety and procrastination made me miss the due date to get paperwork handed in on time last october  finally got it straightened out through an online application at the end of december  assistance back on for january but for only $ a month when the last few years it has been $ or so  

called my worker she confirmed the math lined up and when i asked why my amount is so much lower she kinda avoided the question  asked again and she said something about a change to deductions me paying everything together is causing me to not get all deductions or something like that

i guess why i am posting is to see if anyone else has gone through something like this recently and did you find a way to fix it  i'm considering leaving the program and then going to someone that helps people with the application but need to check if there's a time limit before i'm able to reapply  that or maybe trying to separate my monthly payment in to individual bills i guess"

fast fwd to fall of &gt;today and my ex boyfriend slowly start to agree to things for me to jumpstart my life i’ve started a new job in the same city he lives in and started to stay over at certain days all while i juggle school in between but still travel up and down california and either stay over his place or crash at my friends place when needed

now im here extremely paranoid thinking someones always watching me and i cant sleep while my anxiety is all over the place the investigator told me they have enough evidence to prosecute me with jail time and pay back the full amount of $ with a misdemeanor on my record but then told me if i fess up that i’ve been staying with him even for certain days he’ll drop the amount of time noted in the investigation to  months which will reduce my overall money to payback but im having a real hard time believing in that 

tldr: investigator told me my name has been flagged for fraudulently putting nobody in the household for each renewal now threatened to throw me in jail and pay back the $k what should i do and what should i expect i feel like contacting the county to speak to someone about my case but im scared that might make things worse"

food stamp violation question so i was basically getting unemployment benefits since mid-april and i made a mistake of not reporting it to social service i recently had the interview for the pending fraud allegation and they told me that i’m disqualified for a year as the first violation and will have to pay back the amount and next time to let them know of any changes and let them know when i start working even though i told them that it was a mistake and it wasn’t anything intentional and it just wasn’t in my mind to report it at the time they still considered it as an intentional violation and i’m only scared of being charged and prosecuted for it because i have a son i have to worry about do you think there’s a chance i will be charged and prosecuted i live in the state of va if that helps

however food is an issue i can’t keep weight on bc i can’t afford food with all of my bills and my job is not cutting it it’s starting to frustrate me

"fraud investigation i don’t think i’ve ever posted to reddit before so i hope this post comes out ok my husband’s employer received a letter requesting his wage documents as i’m being investigated for fraud for our snap benefits (louisiana) i did do a recertification in march in which i put that he had quit his second job and i’m pretty sure i had to put in his income for his main job they denied us which was fine because i figured his slight raise disqualified us we got the letter last night from his hr dept and i’ve been sick to my stomach i went on the online portal to see if i could look at my simplified report i sent in march and make sure i put everything in correctly but it wasn’t available online i did then see a notification that said my simplified report was sent back incomplete but i didn’t see that notification earlier than yesterday and received no mail regarding it all i can think of is that maybe i mistyped something 

i then looked at my case file online it had another person added to it that has the same first name as my  year old with a last name that is very similar (one letter off) and whole other ssn i still have a copy of my application and i never added this person she’s listed to be in her s her income is not being used to determine our eligibility it says and she “moved out” the home it claims i have no idea who this woman is or why she’s on our case file but i do have proof from my original application that i never claimed to have this person living with us 

could all of this be one big computer glitch i was up all night from the stress and i’ve been sick all day i’ve never been arrested for anything much less accused of a crime i’m absolutely terrified and the fraud investigator hasn’t called me back yet 

thank you if you read this"
"[ny] how long after leaving job to apply i'm new here so sorry if this is an obvious question i currently work full time and will be leaving my job mid july ahead of starting law school early august i will be applying for snap in ny and will be exempt from the work requirement (full time student work-study eligible $ efc) my university can provide an eligibility letter too

i'm currently trying to figure out how long i should ideally wait after leaving my current job to apply for benefits as i don't want my current monthly income (which i will not have starting mid july) to factor into my eligibility money is tight even with my current job but i have a small amount of savings i can use to get by if it would be beneficial to wait to apply

"why were my food benefits randomly changed to cash benefits (or) i just found out my benefits were changed to cash it seems in the website (or) and it says they have been deposited as cash now and i did not get any food benefits thankfully i had some food balance left but i am confused at why this happened

pua and snap [georgia] i applied for snap like two days ago but i have a few questions about my eligibility i’m  and live with my mom but i buy my own food on the application i put myself down as my own household because i read online that if i buy/prepare my own food then i’m able to put myself down as that did i do that correctly also i’m on the pua program and received $ a week which stopped at the beginning of december for me i was also getting the fpuc and lwa last year until the programs ended if that matters anyway i didn’t get any more pua payments until today so when i did my snap application i put down the amount i had in my bank account which was under the max they allow now i have more money in there so i’m wondering if that affects my eligibility another thing when they asked me how much i make on unemployment i only put $ a month because that’s how much i get on pua i read online that the new fpuc doesn’t count so i didn’t add it did i do that right also will being accepted for snap affect my unemployment benefits thanks in advance

"ebt card deactivated hi folks

my parents are located in massachusetts and their card was recently deactivated pending their recertification they did recertify and dta said they were sending them a new ebt card

there are still unused funds on that old ebt card and after calling dta and various mass offices they've received three separate answers about what happens to the fund on the old card

) the old card will be deactivated in  days from now so they need to use up the funds within the next  days

) the old card's fund will be transferred to the new card so nothing needs to be done 

) the old card can be used indefinitely until all the funds have been used up 

as you can see these various responses aren't really giving a clear answer so i wanted to clarify with anyone here who might be able to provide more insight

thanks a bunch"

"follow up - regarding food stamp fraud investigation and recertification process new york question 

original post is here:  [

during this process i filled out the recertification process online as soon as all of this started and i realized that i should have told them about the gift money i received i submitted a change report with the additional income i called them to verify this change 

i faxed a letter to them about a week ago telling them i no longer need the snap benefits i asked the case worker to close the recertification

i followed up with a phone call

today online the recertification status says ""completed"" instead of closed is this what it should say 

my benefits are still available on my card and i will not be using them but they are there

any ideas on why the status doesn't say closed and what does completed mean

we went in person and explained our issue to the hra worker she wrote an e-mail out to them explaining we were at the shelter and don’t need cash assistance just an open pa case and told us to upload the referral so they can see it as well so from that point on we’ve been waiting to see if they’ve approved or rejected our application it’s been over a month since we did the application (/) and haven’t gotten any updates yet they sent a notice asking for me to upload proof of income which i did right away but i’m scared they’re just going to say i make too much and reject it again

"how does what you spend effect whether or not you qualify *in texas didn't know if that mattered*
so we finally qualified for food stamps for august and september but went over the household income limit in october by $ this was after they changed my husbands work schedule involuntarily to overnight because no one volunteered and it's temporary we don't have a lot of extra money for groceries and i've thankfully been able to stretch what was left of our food stamps hopefully until next year 
i reapplied again and showed that my husbands pay has changed again back down but i'm so nervous we won't qualify because we do have a portion of our pay going out to mental health and physical health that i'm unsure if it's deemed “necessary”
so i guess that is my question is the fact that my husband and i have to go to chiropractic care looked down upon or like it's an actual medical need
or the fact that we are in marriage counseling after our store closed because of covid and our daughter was born
i'm also in individual counseling to sort out starting anxiety/adhd/ocd medication 
are these things that will be looked at and deemed unnecessary and like we do have money does that make sense or do they only look at the fine line of whether or not we go over the income limit"

i am just wondering if it is normal for things to take this long it seems as if my case has not even been looked at since i had the phone interview the woman i originally spoke to on the phone seemed to sound like everything would be approved pretty quickly once all the documents were uploaded but that obviously hasn't been the case i do have a friend who told me she applied back in march or april and hers were not approved for  months this all just seems a bit excessive and i am not sure if i need to call and check on my case or just keep waiting i am a stay at home mom of a  &amp;  year old boy one with cerebral palsy and my husband does not have a very high paying job money is very tight at the moment and i've just been hoping &amp; praying for these food assistance benefits to finally be approved"

"college student snap [tx]
i’m eligible for snap due to being a full time student ( credit hours) and working + hours a week but i’m worried i didn’t fill out my application correctly and i could get in trouble i had a hard time distinguishing between my life at my parents house vs my life at my dorm and i’m afraid it made my information inconsistent i said my address was my parent’s house because it’s my permanent address and i send everything there but then reported my housing payments to be that of my dorm i also provided information as if i’m the head of the household and i live alone despite that not being true for either my parent’s house or my dorm i figured if the snap was only going to be used by me then only my information is necessary any insight would be really helpful i just don’t want to accidentally break the law"

food stamp renewal i’m nervous i recently has a renewal interview and i told them that the father of my  year old wasn’t in the home which is partially true we had an incident where he was court order to leave the home and he stayed with his mom i then applied for stamps and was granted them almost a year later and things cleared up he recently used my address for his new job because he comes and goes to see his son and sometime he stays but we’re arent together and we don’t eat together they said i could be investigated for fraud of i’m lying he does help me pay a bill from time to time but sometimes my friends helps as well what could happen
"previous name on extra checking account need reported we've had fss for some time now but it's redetermination time and i wonder about an account my husband's mother set up in his name as a minor a long ago his name is changed now and isn't the same first or last i do not believe i reported the account in our last report but am uncertain as that was long ago
the account shows up in our bank account information and we can access it the addition of the checking account does not put us over the allotted resource limit i just don't want to get called out on it i'm not sure how to report it either since his name is different our names as they currently appear are on a separate checking and savings

if it matters mum adds $ biweekly to the account in question (her name is on it jointly) i suppose i report that family contribution"
"underpayment of food stamps okay so this is kind of confusing but i'll explain the best i can

october my husband and i were both working and his hours dropped the beginning of october i called them the end of october and reported the change in hours they upped from our food stamps from $ to $ for november and gave me back pay the rd of november for underpaying us in october 
the next week after i called them to let them know his hours had been cut my husband's job fired him it was november the nd so we were without his income the whole month of november i wasn't able to call and let them know of the change until the very beginning of december they upped my food stamps from $ to $
i asked them shouldn't i be getting back pay for november since we only had my income the whole month of november the guy on the phone said because we called in december and not november there was nothing he could do for us is there any other way to try and get the back pay or is what he said actually true i live in missouri if that matters "
" questions from florida i posted these a bit late to the party in a thread from last week on r/povertyfinance:

**question **

households where at least one member receives disability are tested only at a net income limit rather than a gross income limit when *applying for or renewing* snap which in my case is $ in fl i renew every  months

in my biannually approval letter however it states that:

&gt; the only change you must report **during your certification period** is when your household’s monthly gross income is more than your income limit of $ 

bolded emphasis is mine now is this just a universal form letter's technical omission of the net-only test for my circumstances or am i allowed to earn up to the gross limit instead of the net limit while in between renewals

**question **

some others have mentioned gift cards like visa/mastercard gcs and it seems clear those should be counted as cash oftentimes especially during holiday seasons entry into or invitations to attend charity events relies along the same income guidelines so many snap recipients participate

it's become really common the last several years or so for grocery store gift cards to be included as part of these events sometimes for a couple hundred dollars what kind of technical impact might gifts like that have what about the meal/food giveaways that are also common during holidays

i realize the casual answer might be to shrug it off but i'm just curious where the boundaries are anyway or if there's an 'official' opinion

**question **

if a recipient pre-pays certain bills like utilities and rent etc almost in a way giving themselves a line of 'credit' specifically with that account/landlord would that have any impact on snap eligibility this was brought up as a way of handling the resource limit in a legal/exempt way 

since it's hard to get a liquid emergency fund that covers -months expenses with the resource limits being what they are this was mentioned as a way to achieve a certain version of it with the thought being that an emergency fund would likely be used to cover those exact expenses like rent/utilities during a time of crisis 

if the living expense bills like that were prepaid to a -month projection and then the recipient also gets to the $k resource cap it's possible that may be stable enough to transition off of the program in a sustainable way 

thanks :)"

"case workers: what part of the snap process have you seen be hardest for clients what's improved it first a huge thank you to all eligibility staff and case workers on here who take the time to help people struggling with the process  


this may be a bit of an out-there question but i've spent the last  years working to make the process of applying for and keeping snap benefits easier for clients and i'm curious about your experiences with this  


from your experience:

  
\- what parts of the process are most difficult for clients what leads otherwise eligible applicants to not make it through  


\- what changes in your state county or office have made the process better for your clients in your experience (for example policy changes training it systems business process changes lobby improivements)"

"college student - pandemic exemption hi all

starting in january  there was federal legislation that expanded snap benefits to college students during the public health emergency it made students who were eligible for work study and who had an expected family contribution (efc) of  eligible to receive food stamps

i applied back in may and was approved i'm currently a non-ohio resident going to school in ohio for graduate school i was approved for work study and have an efc of  due to being a grad student

however i've had some recent worries about my eligibility i uploaded all the documents required such as my bank account my personal ids information about my car and rent payments student loans roommate information so on and so forth i had a phone interview where they asked me a few questions and then approved me

i've found some inconsistent information about asset testing-- i found the federal limits for assets regarding bank accounts and assets such as cars and those financial limits which i am above however i believe i've found information that states ohio doesn't do asset testing when considering eligibility for food stamps but nothing concrete i did find information about income levels which i am well below as i was unemployed and i am currently earning \~$/month from work study (which is not counted as regular income i believe)

essentially i'm worried that i was approved mistakenly because of this special exception and that it will be found and i'll have to pay the money back as a grad student you can imagine that i don't really have much excess money to do so if anyone who is more familiar with the snap program could address my concerns i would be incredibly grateful

tldr: ohio grad student who is a non-resident of ohio approved for food stamps income level is well below poverty line but has assets above the federal limit not sure if my residency status or assets disqualify me and i was misapproved and will owe money back

thank you"

"nyc snap questions hi

i just got my letter in the mail to apply for nyc's snap benefits and i have some questions

**residence**:  
i'm currently (legally) subletting someone else's room in brooklyn and am not on the lease but still pay rent to my roommate via venmo and she then pays then landlord  would screenshots of these venmo payments count as proof of residence  or would i **need** the landlord's letter as solid proof (he's a bit hard to get ahold of hence why i ask) 

i live with  other people but am not sure if listing them on my documentation would help or hurt my case in terms of how much $$$ i qualify for

&amp;#xb;

**income**:

i'm still receiving unemployment benefits from wi  if i state this in my unearned income will it deny my eligibility since the income from unemployment is coming from wi  or are the chances low that they would notice this  if the latter is the case i was planning on just putting down the money i make from freelancing and skipping the unearned income all together if that's an easier option  (i never switched to nyc unemployment because it took soooo long for my pua to come through in wi and i'm worried that because it's a pua it won't transfer over smoothly here  plus those benefits run out in march anyway so)

"calfresh/calworks (ca) overpayment + tax garnishment hey all this is long but would love help my question is mostly whether i need to lawyer up for this or what i should do based on the misinformation &amp; administrative errors that have persistently happened in response to my overpayment case for overpayment cases how long are you responsible for making payments for especially when the error was their fault

my overpayment from  was due to administrative error resulting in $ overpayment total in calfresh+calworks in alameda county (in the bay area this still wasn't even covering our bills)

the judgment in  was $/month payments when i appealed the case the first time i received a letter from the state of california that said that - at least for calfresh - the debt would be forgiven after  months of payments i set up autopayments &amp; set them to automatically stop and in total made about  payments

i stopped receiving information/statements/bills from them around the same time it was mid-pandemic there was a lot going on and honestly the combination of the two things just made it slip my mind until the end of the year i just assumed based on the information sent to me when i started making payments that the account was settled and didn't follow up with them right away

i finally called to make sure it was good before filing taxes they told me no it hadn't been forgiven and that i was on the tax intercept list due to my lapse in payments i now live in wisconsin so they can only garnish for calfresh when i told them about the letter they said that i just needed to submit it and then yes it would be forgiven i never received more information i called again and they said they reviewed my case and that my debt would only have been forgiven after  months if i had been a food stamp recipient again which i hadn't

the letter i received from the state said nothing about needing to be a food stamp recipient again just simply said that after  payments that my debt would be forgiven

i've tried to talk to them and they just keep saying that it was my decision not to call and follow-up and make sure that everything was squared away and thus i'm responsible they haven't been at all helpful

additionally i wouldn't normally get a tax refund at all but this year it's going to be huge because i got full % custody of my daughter last year i really need that money - which i should have gotten through my paycheck but just never changed my withholdings - because i'm fully financially responsible for her now

i've filed an appeal but not sure what else i can do here i'm not even really clear if i'm still supposed to be making payments or not

any insight thoughts advice"

i figure if we get disqualified we could live partly off of our savings until it's gone then i can apply again

also our son is autistic and i tried to get social security disability back in  right before covid started and even with our old flooded out cars and nothing in savings we didn't qualify i know i need to try again but it's kinda discouraging to continually get disqualified for help"
texas - child tax credit &amp; applying i have to reapply for snap this month right now i'm not working due to dealing with some legal issues &amp; health concerns my only money coming in is the child tax credit payments how do i handle that on the application i think those are exempt as income right
account locked florida ebt i can't access my account or change my password to get into it it says my account is locked and that i need to call to unlock it i've tried calling but it says their offices are closed for the holiday but i just got a call back from them and have been on hold am i gonna be waiting forever cause no one's working today
"(ny) repeatedly falsely accused of not providing evidence lost money on mail fees and fair hearing was a bust my snap application loaded with every source of my income and my assets and hand-typed letters as statements was rejected and i was accused of not providing several things which i did i call them to find out what the problem is and they assure me on the phone and the next things i'm to send are the last things i send in more evidence and they reject it again accusing me of ""not verifying any aspect of snap eligibility""

i demand a fair hearing i prepare and wait the judge says ""you've been meticulous"" and recommends i resubmit with his letter/decision which can arrive in  weeks it has been  weeks or more and i have received nothing it has been /+ weeks since my initial application snap's false accusations and baiting someone into spending money on evidence shipments could easily kill someone impoverished and could have killed me if my disabilities had struck me before i worked and saved something to repel death

this terrible experience aside i'd love to see posts or comments from others who have experienced the same

i also have a question - if i decide to reapply should i move - this time keeping my shipping costs as low as possible or hand-delivering it my next possible county appears to demand the ssn and income of roommates these roommates are complete strangers to me and are uncooperative for any aspect of living as is and - rightfully so - will never provide such invasively personal information of course some sources say you're still eligible if there is no food sharing but the form demands the ssn and income column be filled and only gives an exception for people without an ssn to begin with am i stonewalled from snap once i have these roommates  


edit: they will not even pick up the phone to speak to me and their voicemailbox is full probably from other people they do not give benefits to"
it seems like they discontinued my benefits i got an eligibility paper in the mail and didn't turn it in on time i was told i had a month to turn it in on the phone i called today and my account doesn't even show up anymore another thing is when i submitted my food stamps at first i bought food for myself and still am but on the eligibility thing it asks about anyone in the house and their income which shouldn't matter since its just for me i'm just pissed off that this has happened what do i do to fix all of this i can't lie and say my roommates don't work and i already don't have my benefits anymore  i live in ca
"[idaho] question about special rules with dac + medicaid and if they affect snap benefits  hey fellow redditors i'm looking for help figuring this out i'm not a lawyer and can't quite understand the legalities in the rules and regulations of snap at a federal level vs state i moved to idaho from oregon and they are giving me the most difficult time getting things sorted 

i  get disabled adult child benefits and qualify for medicaid under(c) that rule basically only counts the maximum ssi as income and disregards the remaining amount there's more nuance to the calculation but this is the best way to put it and i was told that rule also applied to snap that's what the supervisor in oregon told me and he did all the footwork he verified it through the system and explained to me what it does with the medicaid and food benefits

fast forward to idaho and now i'm being told that's not the case i sent a copy of my statement which includes my claim number on top of that they aren't getting the correct information from  ssa and are requesting that i get the verification for them i don't  think they provided the ssa with my correct information (ie using my ssn instead of the claim number under which i get benefits) and asked them  to clarify if they did and they said ssa found no proof of me being a dac the state office pretty much told me to get the proof myself when i asked about the food stamps if they would be adjusted the same way as medicaid when i provided the proof they said they won't so i called ssa and they confirmed i'm a dac and meet the qualification for (c) and are mailing me a copy of the statement that  verifies it and then i went down a massive rabbit hole of reading all the rules and regulations of snap

yet i  can't find anything that would confirm or deny it at least not in words that's easy to understand does anyone know if snap does in fact exclude income the same way it is excluded for medicaid under the special rules if it does then what do i say or provide to the state department that would back up my case if it doesn't then did oregon perhaps wrongly issue me more food benefits than i was entitled to would they try to come back for repayment if they did 

apologies for the long post

tldr;  does snap apply the same rules as medicaid does when excluding income  as per (c); and if they do is it by state or is it federal what do i say or provide to the state department that would back up my case if it doesn't then did oregon  wrongly issue me more food benefits than i was entitled to would they try to come back for repayment if they did"

"overissuance hey everyone

so i’m in a bit of a pickle i recently received a letter in the mail saying i owe $ to calfresh which is interesting because i have never applied for or had food-stamps in my life after calling and digging around i discovered that it is because my mother who passed way in  named me on there back in  (when i was  and she was living with me) i had no knowledge of this and never signed or received any sort of benefits in my name apparently she had a hearing in june of  which she obviously missed because she died in may of  the lady i spoke to at calfresh basically told me “i know this sounds messed up but they don’t care that your mother is deceased you were a part of the household so you are legally liable for the overissuance” &amp; that basically all i can do is hope that the judge overseeing my hearing on the th understands the situation and doesn’t make me pay it this has all been so incredibly frustrating and stressful does anyone have any advice or has ever dealt with something like this"

how would this work texas hypothetical question say someone's bank account is frozen temporarily for non-child support reasons they were self employed but obviously because the bank's frozen they aren't getting any of the funds if they work is it still counted as they're getting income for snap or would snap recognize they aren't actually getting the funds

"food stamps and homeschooling (nc) yesterday i had my recertification interview forgot to ask my caseworker so i figured i'd ask here i'm sure they're swamped with everything going on in regards to the shut down and this question is very low-priority in comparison

just as a background we have been thinking about possibly homeschooling my son when the time comes (he's only two so this is still pretty far in the future) one of the questions during the interview and on the recertification paperwork asked (paraphrasing here): ""do you operate a homeschool at least  hours per week""

this made me curious and i couldn't find anything about it online i was wondering if you're allowed to homeschool when you are receiving food stamps and if so does it change anything in regards to requirements or anything else hopefully by then we we'll be doing better financially and won't need food stamps but i wanted to ask partly due to curiosity and partly for future reference

"confused about first time using ebt card hi all

i recently applied for snap (new jersey) for the hell of it to see if i would be able to be accepted i was but for only $ a month i’m not complaining help with groceries is always beneficial no matter the amount 

here’s where i’m confused i went to the store and my total came out to $ i thought hey i’ll just use the card for $ and pay the $ with my cash but instead the entire transaction was approved and the card paid for the whole thing and on my receipt the remaining balance was $ meaning my original allotted balance was $ where on earth did this come from did someone mess up when they were making my account when i try to login or call to check my remaining balance i get an error or the site is down 

this is my first time using any of this so i’m hesitant to keep using the card in fear of them coming after me to pay back the balance should i keep using it"
"i’m scared i unintentionally committed fraud on my mothers behalf i cannot admit how scared i am as i am tying this i feel so ashamed and stupid my mother() and i(/f) live in nyc in june  my mother stopped going to work and exhausted her short term disability until december  in a panic i contacted community centers asking for suggestions to bring in some income for my mother they suggested that i apply for unemployment and food stamps for my mom my mother was quickly approved for unemployment meanwhile i didn’t hear anything back from hra about the food stamps and quickly forgot about it in that same month my mother decided to apply for early retirement through social security 

my mother was recently diagnosed with dementia in dec  and social security officially recognized it in june  her first disability payment was on july  with a large lump sum payment to cover the months she was receiving retirement income 

what fuels my fear and current anxiety is the fact that i just submitted a case change request and now realize that i don’t see the unemployment income listed in the form 

another piece of information that i hope is helpful is that between january  when i submitted the food stamp application and august  i didn’t know that my mothers food stamp application was approved she never received a phone call or a letter in the mail saying it was approved so i was paying for groceries for those months i honestly forgot all about putting in that food stamps application until my mothers bank account was running low and i decided to check the portal i called the hotline and was told to go to the office to get a new card and have been using it ever since the balance on the card was over $ 

now i’m scared and have no idea where to even begin to fix that error of my ways i’ve called the hotline several times and the line kicks you off after you’ve been on hold for  minutes my mother has quite a bit of money in her savings and i could also pay so i would rather have things dealt with soon does anyone have any suggestions 

tl;dr: i applied for food stamps for my mother and forgot i submitted the application she started receiving retirement and unemployment then once her money went dry i realized her food stamps were approved the only issue is her unemployment income isn’t listed in the food stamps file now i’m very very very scared of the consequences any help is appreciated"

also my fs ended in june even though i did my renewal in may for june they ended up denying me august st because of a bonus i had gotten in may i reapplied august nd and they got back to me october th with my approval i got $ back fs for august $ back fs for september and my normal $ for october since i got some back fs should i also get the max for those months as well 

sorry this is so long
thanks in advance for the help"

"retroactive ssdi payment and medicaid in pennsylvania i apologize for asking about this here but i know many of the caseworkers handle both and i tried in /r/medicaid and nobody responded

&amp;nbsp;

it is my understanding that phe will keep this from being an issue for the moment but i would like to get it permanently resolved ahead of time

i had to wait three years for my ssdi benefits to start and during that time i amassed a very significant retroactive amount my understanding is that this payment is exempt from the asset test for a period of six months however with the size of this payment there is absolutely no way that it will be exhausted in that period

i am on medicare now so personally i would be fine without medicaid however my children very much need the coverage

short of gifting it to one of my children to buy a house is there any way that i can keep medicaid despite this windfall

are there any asset tests for chip"

"request for bank statements from alameda county california hi there i am in alameda county in california i was enrolled in graduate school full time for the past  years during that time my family ( adults  children) received snap benefits i graduated and started my first job in october and we reported the new income and our benefits ended (which was expected)

however last week we received a letter stating that the state can match “income lump sum payments resources or interest and dividend payments of all welfare recipients” and is requesting bank statements or authorization for the state to access the information on that account for the year  on a few savings accounts we have at a bank that is not our every day bank the letter indicates we did not report these accounts on our application i have no recollection of being asked to report accounts on our application but i guess it’s possible i forgot to report them all we use them for is saving for long term/emergency situations and until the money was gone funds saved for my tuition we don’t receive income there other than a few cents or a couple of dollars worth of interest sometimes (depending on rate and balance in account)

all that to say i am uncomfortable with the request and don’t understand why it is being requested the letter is unclear is it suggesting the system thinks we were receiving unreported income into these accounts am i wrong in my understanding that california does not count savings when assessing eligibility for snap we definitely held onto funds through my graduate school program in order to pay tuition but we always qualified for snap from an income perspective 

i have left multiple messages for the individual who sent the letter but they have not responded yet to my request for clarity on what the letter is asking for i feel really anxious about it or that we somehow misunderstood our eligibility and could be assessed as ineligible for benefits we were given more than  years ago 

thanks in advance"
 and still living with my parents i have my own job that goes under the requirements but was wondering if i would qualify since they make over the requirements i live in idaho

"benefits canceled without warning (in mi) tldr version - benefits disappeared without warning representatives only say ""we're behind"" when i call them i've been without benefits for well over a month

so i'm in mi and have been receiving food stamps for some time i had my  month review then received a letter stating that i needed to send in proofs of self-employment income the problem is i don't have self-employment income i did however over  years ago i have talked to representatives numerous times about the fact that my account still shows that i'm still self employed and have tried to remove it from the website myself to no avail so i went on the mibridges website and tried removing it again stating again that i haven't had self employment income for years i also changed jobs at the same time so i reported that as well i did this well within the timeframe on the notice this was back in october

fast forward to november and the date that my card gets filled comes and goes and it's not being refilled so i hop on mibridges again and my food benefits are just completely gone so i called the number spoke to someone and she told me she'd get it taken care of the next day 

 weeks went by and still nothing so i called again it's been over a month by this time thanksgiving had come and gone and i had nothing for november the person i spoke to this time would not tell me anything other than they're behind i asked why they were canceled why i never even received a cancellation notice how much longer it was going to be as it's already been a month and she would tell me nothing except ""we're behind and doing our best"" food stamp applications aren't supposed to take longer than  days that's after the initial application for me this is just a renewal i don't know why it's taking so long and they will tell me nothing 

to add i'm in the up in mi in a small area and we don't have a local office anymore haven't for years you call downstate and talk to whoever answers the phone so i don't have an actual caseworker 

it's now december and i had to apply for state emergency relief for heat and electricity i'm guessing they're gonna have a huge influx of people applying for ser because they're cutting off people's food stamps with no warning at all and have no answers when you call them which is just gonna make more work for them rinse and repeat

anyhoo i'm rambling now does anyone have any advice or is anyone else experiencing this this is the worst possible time for this it's almost christmas"

"americorps eligibility for snap benefits is really confusing so i tried to apply for food stamps as an americorps member this time around and i was denied the confusion is one whether or not the stipend received as an americorps would count as income the lady cited colorado law which states ""earned income includes government payments from agricultural stabilization and conservation service and wages of americorps volunteers in service to america (vista) workers vista payments are excluded if the client was receiving snap benefits when he or she joined vista if the client was not receiving snap benefits when he or she joined vista the vista payments shall count as earned income""

however i tried to explain to her that there are different rules for americorps vista members and americorps state and national members but she said they are all grouped into the same category in their system and would abide by the same rules

i did run into another article though

[

here it states that """"the ncsa states that allowances earnings and payments to participants in americorps programs “shall not be considered income for the purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of income transfer and in-kind aid furnished under any federal or federally-assisted program based on need other than as provided in the social security act”  usc § (d)""""

in this article they are separating the two americorps programs (vista and state/national) and saying there are different rules on whether to count the stipend as income when applying for food benefits

when i applied she said that she even grouped me under ncsa and said i still didn't qualify

so can someone set the record straight does it matter if americorps members are from vista or state/national programs if they apply and do they have to be receiving benefits beforehand as a state/national member to receive food stamps there seems to be conflicting information and a discrepancy between federal and state laws and then which one would override the other"

"[florida] i’ve never had this problem before calling dcf so i had to call dcf to do my interview for food stamps less than a month ago and everything was fine and everything went through fine i had to still upload my paystubs for everyone on the food stamps which took a while and because of that they put my account on hold i’ve been trying to call them for  and a half hours now and all i get after i put my case number and social and birthday into the call pad is the automated voice saying that all of the people are unavailable and to call again later or press  to hear the automated message for  minutes all over again and to input my info again is there a number i can call that’ll just put me on hold because i know if i hang up like the message tells me to i’ll never get a hold of someone

update: my aunt in law who helped me through the application process was able to get through and merged the call with me i’ve been on hold for  hours going on but i’d much rather be on hold then have to call over and over again and input the same information

update : the call dropped after  hours and  minutes so here i am having trying to call them and actually speak to a human but when i called them when they opened on the dot apparently they were all busy again i’ve tried calling this help line at least  times in the past  hours and haven’t spoken to a human yet it’s actually insane"
"[florida] in the middle of applying for benefits and my “account is no longer active” alright i applied for food stamps about ten days ago i called to complete a telephone interview case worker explains i would have to verify check stubs to my account when prompted one day later i attempt to log into my account to upload check stubs it says 

“your account is no longer active” 

then i do what the site suggests opening a new account with the same case number 

says i can’t open an account with this case number since it’s already linked to an account 

this seems like an error however calling the phone line does nothing the lines never get me through and i work in the early morning hours does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve this problem 

thanks for any time and effort"
how long should i expect the extra food stamps to keep going i'm in michigan and we've been getting the extra amount each month halfway through it about how long should i expect that to continue i'd love it if it never stops because i've gotten used to eating every day but i doubt that'll happen

"how do i go about calling to change information on my application hello everyone i’m posting here because i need some help figuring out how to go about calling and reporting that my girlfriend who i applied with is no longer sharing food with me at this point we’re pretty much broken up but trying to figure out a way to move on in our own lives at the moment we still live together and are no longer sharing food we split the bills evenly so i know i’ll still qualify and maybe for more than we were receiving together however i’m nervous that if i were to call and report this it would not be taken seriously or i wouldn’t know how to effectively explain my situation

during my phone interview the gentleman asking me questions was being very personal and asking questions i didn’t think were even appropriate he argued with me about my girlfriends choice in schooling and told me that according to his resources she was making close to a hundred thousand dollars per year(she works part time at starbucks) i told him this wasn’t true and he basically asked me if i knew for sure she wasn’t lying about her income there were other even more personal things he tried to bring up but i asked if they were necessary for my application and he finally continued to the normal stuff like telling me i would need to provide paystubs/etc 

i guess what i’m most nervous about is when i call will i be automatically handed back over to this same guy i really need the food stamps even the $ is beneficial for buying a large bag of rice that can hold me over from paychecks i’m just seeking some guidance 

thank you"
"need help  living with parents parents refuse to sign with me i'm currently unemployed and living rent free at my home until i'm able to support myself

"question about resource limits vs overpaying bills in r/povertyfinance a post was made for general advice purposes about overpaying bills and the buffer it can give when emergencies come up i'd talked about this with other recipients before and the post reminded me that this might be a useful way for benefits recipients to build up a mock emergency fund

some of the challenges of following sensible financial planning steps hit a real roadblock when it comes to the resource limits recipients still need to stabilize themselves like anyone else and not being able to save up - months net income/projected expenses (whether it's supposed to be income or expense changes depending on who you ask) as an emergency fund *before* graduating off of benefits keeps people yo-yoing on and off of them as their situation fluctuates

in trying to find a practical way to allow people to create this kind of emergency fund situation that doesn't lose them their benefits *and* isn't breaking any rules is it possible for them to pay ahead on their bills to build up a - month buffer on each without running afoul of snap policies

while i realize this would be logistically difficult for a recipient to do in the first place reach that - month prepaid goal on a number of bills (such as rent utilities insurance etc) it's still a potential outcome of incrementally increasing payments to get to that point of credit or a good use of any tax return funds if they aren't earmarked for other expenses 

there are other pitfalls to the idea that they would need to consider too (like whether or not they could get that excess back if they moved/closed the account what have you) the questions i'm just trying to answer at the moment is if this would negatively impact their ability to receive snap benefits

if there's not a policy preventing this do you think it would be seen as problematic even so

i then proceeded to speak with a calfresh representative through the helpline and they said that the account is still active and has a balance along with everything being correct on their end with no issues they told me to contact the county office tomorrow and get another card issued to me

has this ever happened to anyone else  i find it weird that a card can just be canceled randomly without notice if everything is correct and active i'm also afraid that maybe someone has my card number and was the one to cancel it but that doesn't really make sense to me either

edit: so i went down to the human services building and they said there's been an increase in ebt fraud so they've been cancelling ebt cards and sending out new ones without notice i was able to get a replacement right then and there instead of waiting for it in the mail i'll leave this up in case anyone else faces the same problem as me in the future"

i just spent some time researching possible penalties and processes involving snap fraud investigation teams court cases etc as a full time student and mom i have zero time to go through something as stressful as this i can't imagine having to find an attorney and go through the motions of it all i'm considering just looking for work and canceling any and all assistance from the state it has been a rocky road dealing with false renewal notices when i already renewed and issues locating my caseworker etc id rather just end it all now

if i am accused of fraud will cancelling all assistance prevent me from having to deal with any further issues"
"missing ebt funds i never got my february funds early and now today the th of february they're still not there when i called and checked the hotline for my balance there was a pending balance to go through on the th of march i'm on hold now but i have an infant on her last tub of formula and i don't get paid until friday the food bank doesn't give infant formula and she's almost out i have no idea what to do we won't make it until friday and i feel so screwed

update: so after spending over an hour on hold with the dhs in my area comes to my attention that they made a mistake with their early funding due to the shutdown they won't admit to their mistake and are holding fast and will not fund for february's ebt

i did not receive an early payment in january for february but they are saying that i did when i absolutely know i did not and i even told them to check my payment history and spending history for my ebt card and they still don't believe me

i was given a phone number for a place that can help downtrodden families in poverty but there's a waiting list and they're going to give me a call back as soon as they can and it's been a few hours since then oh but i was able to beg for a few dollars at work so i'm going to see what i can do to feed my daughter for the next few nights"
"need some advice on snap eligibility i'm living in maryland

my girlfriend is currently receiving snap benefits as well as medicare and is undergoing methadone treatment which is allowing her to receive benefits without work limitations

we're now expecting a child and are now living together but seeing as how i'm able bodied but unemployed currently (i trade stocks at home which i don't believe is legally considered a professional job) and receiving medicaid state insurance myself would the change in household cause us to lose benefits all together

we do plan to be married in the near future as well"
"[texas] bank account asset limit question it seems like the asset limit is extremely strict compared to other states in many states they do not even care about how much money you have in the bank account as long as your income is low income

i only make $ a month but i have $ from an accident settlement recently i would like to keep this money around for potential medical bills 

i would like to go on food stamps but am wondering how i can deal with the money since this state's limit is around $ i believe

my question is will snap find out about the $ if i simply just put it in a different bank account and not mention it 

is there a way for snap texas to find out how many bank accounts i have and is it easy for them to get a subpoena to look at my other bank records cashing out isn't really an option since i do not believe it is safe 

i do not want to spend down the money since i am not in good health and i am afraid that i will need to pay a lot of medical expenses"
does ebt backpay in ny our expenses rose a bit and im hoping we will get more in food stamps when renewal rolls around would we get backpay because we renewed right before moving our rent went from  to  i cant keep living on $ a month for food because our bills and rent are so high on one income i cant work and im a stay at home mom they have not backpayed us before for similar circumstance so probably just wishful thinking
income verification for household members i rent a room in ar in a house of a family friend he also lives here and also rents rooms out to other people here i prepare my meals separately from them i recently stopped working due to a health issue and he stopped charging me rent temporarily which has been reported to my case and is beside the point i have already reported the names of each person living in the house it is being requested that i report income for each person living in the house they do live here but i am the only one in my personal household do i have to report income for each one of them to keep receiving benefits for myself there is one member specifically that i do not believe has filed taxes i don’t think they want their income listed and probably won’t comply i’m also not sure what would happen if i listed something that couldn’t be verified through whatever process dhs might use for that will this cancel me out help
"(ohio)- snap benefits question: increase in benefits i sent a email to my case manager's assistant last week (around october th) that i currently get snap ebt benefits; have been getting them for awhile however; i have been helping pay (splitting bills) with my roommate now akaelectric internet garbage etc) she sent me a email back saying ""thanks for letting her know she would forward the email to the case worker to review""  
my question is; i called the ebt card and it still has the same amount of money 'set' to be placed on the card soon so no 'increase yet' i would think they likely will need ""documentation"" of the split bills (that i now pay) which affects my overall income  
anyways one week later; and still no mail from them (nor email) if they need any additional information   


\*\*\*\*                                                                                                                                                              \*\*\*\*

how long does it generally take to 'increase' someone's benefit amount when they are getting $xx vs a increase to say $xxxis it within a month"
"calfresh overissuance but have not spent ebt funds los angeles california my parents applied for calfresh this past fall because they were laid off they used/spent the food stamp money they received for only a month (october) because they each found a job again a week after they started work they went in person to tell their case worker that they no longer needed food stamp assistance they took their paystubs and the caseworker told them to email her a copy of one paystub they forgot (i did that for them later that day) after two weeks they hadn't received notice that their assistance would stop so my mom called the case worker had an attitude and said she didn't know about any mail or emails because she hadn't checked her mail in a month and told my mom they would receive a letter when it's done two weeks pass nothing so my mom calls again and someone else tells her she can't connect her to her case worker because she's on vacation and no one else can look into my parents' case until she gets back my mom got tired of trying and didn't go back in person because no one ever helps and it's frustrating

now in february after i figured out how to set up their online account i can see that they kept receiving money from calfresh it's about to k now i submitted the semi-annual report (sar ) for them on feb  with the completed form and uploaded their paystubs (however it says ""incomplete //"" now under case status information)
i'm worried this will probably be considered overissuance even though my parents alerted the office they no longer wanted assistance they also stopped touching the money once they found their jobs 

q: will they have to pay back the money or can we expect that all the money on their ebt/calfresh account will be taken instead (and they won't have to pay out of their pocket) 
thank you for your time for reading this"
"confusion about verifying work hours hello this is a bit complex but i'll try to explain it as best as i can

i'm applying for snap benefits for the first time (i live and work in ma) i work  part time jobs and my hours have changed recently so in addition to sending  weeks of pay stubs the person i spoke to during my interview wants me to get a letter from each employer staying my wage my anticipated weekly hours and my start date

job information as it's necessary:

i started job a in mid-late december  at the time it was my only job so i was being scheduled around  hours a week 

i started job b january   i had to change my hours at job a to allow me to be able to schedule  jobs job b has me working around - hours a week depending on the week 

starting january  job a has been scheduling me for respectively  hr/wk then  hr/wk then  hr/wk and they only give us our schedule a half week in advance 

so during my interview i told her i work about  hours a week at job a and about  hours a week at job b i explained that i've had scheduling changes so my  weeks past pay stubs (which i dont even have  weeks worth from job b) won't accurately reflect my current / near future work she asked me to get letters from someone higher up than me stating these changes so they can verify them and to give an estimate as to what my anticipated weekly hours will be 

my supervisor at job a wrote me my letter and gave it to me today but in it she says i work  hours a week and will continue to this is a small business and my scheduling has been really wonky since i started my second job and i don't think they're going to give me that many hours i'm not sure what to do it was already an uncomfortable conversation for me to have with her in the first place and i know the owner of the store doesn't like that i have a second job i feel really uncomfortable about going to her and asking her to be more accurate in the letter 

should i just sent in what i have and send in my most recent pay stubs is there any other way than asking her to rewrite the letter to deal with this i'm sorry if this is a question that can't be answered 

an additional question i have is what is the best way to go about keeping my information updated when i don't have the same exact hours every week and i'm planning on returning to my old job in may (it's on a farm so i have to find different jobs in the winters) so i want to make sure i stay on top of keeping my information accurate"
food stamp fraud investigation ok so i’m being investigated for food stamp fraud and the investigator has “ gotten all the information she needs” and she says she’s ready for a “meeting” really freaking out about this i have zero criminal background and work a regular - job with  kids me and my fiancé are really freaking out and wondering should we get a an attorney we don’t make a lot of money so can’t even afford one either
texas snap - i'm in tears; help for  week i've been trying to get food stamps knowing my tax return was running out  for  weeks i've been answering the same question - how do you make money  i answer the same thing - i receive no income no child support or ssi for my deaf -month old (hopefully she's approved soon)  how do i become one of the fortunate that gets approved asap
"question regarding ssi &amp; snap so recently i was approved for ssi and i already had snap since november of last year however i looked at the resource limits for snap and it made me question if that rl applies or the ssi one is the only meaningfully considered rl the snap limit seems to be (about) k assets for a single individual household before you're ineligible while ssi has the k limit however it also says in snap's site that ssi isn't actually counted as a resource so would that mean that (theoretically) one can have up to just below the ssi limit and still retain snap or would the k limit still apply even if all of the money is accrued through ssi

as an aside i assume that able accounts do *not* count in any fashion

az des hung up on me after being on the phone for two and a half hours i was hung up on randomly as my application for nutritional assistance was being reviewed should i be expecting a call back or do i need to spend the rest of my day on hold again is there any other way to find out if my documents have been approved or if / when i can expect to receive ebt

if you could order groceries online for delivery from a local market or farmer's market would that be better than amazon or walmart because so far only the online retail giants accept food stamps for online purchase and delivery
"applying for food stamps: should i apply as married or not hi 

so me and my wife arent legally married i know that's a confusing sentence but we got married in our religious ceremony and are living together but haven't gotten around to getting legally married yet

&amp;#xb;

we were recently told to apply for food stamps/snap but were not sure how to go about it ( we live in nyc btw)

&amp;#xb;

she has no income and is a student in a master's program but she has over k in savings

i on the other hand make $/hour for  hours a week but have no savings

&amp;#xb;

i think at best one only of us qualifies

is there a benefit to applying as married or are we better of applying as single people"
was i approved for snap where is my ebtcard i haven’t received an approval letter with my amount for each month or an ebt card but i did get a letter today outlining the rules of the program so i called the toll free number and it said my application status was open and how much was deposited onto my card… but i still don’t have a card did things maybe just get sent to me out of order i’ve never had to apply for any type of government assistance before so i’m not sure how the whole process works just wondering if i should be expecting a card to show up soon or if i need to try and call dss
when/if i need to report income change tn i work as a student worker at a local university i work - hours a week during the semesters and get paid on the th of every month i started getting food stamps in october however i work full time during the summer basically when classes end the first week of may my hours will ramp up and increase to a steady  throughout june july and august so the paychecks i get on june july august and probably september th will be full time hour checks i know this is going to put me over the limit most likely i just want to know the easiest way to report this change and when or do i even need to since it’s only for - months i will also go back to  hours a week when classes start back at the end of august so i’d need to get the assistance back thanks

ebt in ny is frustrating for the first time in my life i had to go on food stamps  i moved to nyc and have had a difficult time finding a job  then the pandemic happened  i was volunteering but those places closed as well  since i am over  i not considered abawd (able bodies adults without dependents) i recertified everything seemed fine  waiting for the interview was worse  no one called  i get a paper saying my benefits would be cancelled if i didn't have the interview before the   i called and called  i tried a different # and someone answered  said she couldn't do the interview but put me in saying if i didnt hear by thursday to go to the office  which i did  had my interview they said my case closed on april  but the letter was dated the   i was confused  he put me back in then i get notification on the app that i owe a few more documents  work search (which is usually not for those over ) proof i am not abawd (my birth certificate and id say otherwise  and household composition which i had already submitted  i don't know what is going on but others have issues as well considering how many people were at the office  is this normal  i am looking for work  they sent me a form for work search but it is for children's services which doesn't apply to me

am i eligible

i believe i’m eligible; i make $ an hour but i live on my own with $ rent per month i pay all my bills gas etc on my own and i’m struggling to keep afloat i’m already behind on my evergy bill by like $

what do they look at when i provide bank statements 

i have adhd and clinical depression and… my spending habits aren’t amazing i try to be pretty responsible with my money but once rent phone bill gas is paid i usually use the rest of my money for food (i don’t cook very often because i can’t keep track of groceries due to time blindness and object permanence issues and i work a lot so i end up not having much time anyway) and that is usually pretty costly since i end up buying food that’s pre-made rather than cooking i am just wondering if they look at what we spend our money on vs how much we have to pay in bills i already struggle with feeling bad for spending money on things i like periodically but i don’t know how much they expect people to set aside for that stuff

if i apply and after reviewing my bank statements current circumstances etc they believe me to be ineligible is that illegal can i get put in jail for applying despite being unknowingly ineligible 

ultimately having food stamps would help me so much with catching up on bills since most of the time i’m spending my money on food anyway and i am desperately behind on everything even college tuition

i also put that i lived at my dorm when they asked for home address i figured home address meant the address you lived at % of the time…so i probably got qualified because they thought i was independent (i’m not i’m still dependent on my dads taxes and i live with him during summer)

"can i still apply for food stamps or an ebt card if i'm a single adult living in the same household as someone who already has an ebt card (ks) i live in kansas
ok so i live with my father but he doesn't support me i'm employed and pay my own way he's unemployed and has custody of my two younger sisters for the past two years we had no food stamps because he wouldn't let me apply for the family as head of household and he wouldn't fill out the paperwork because he was ""too busy"" 
i finally had to fill out the entire paperwork myself and just let him sign his name and whatnot he and my two younger sisters are the only ones on the paperwork i'm saying this to give you an idea of why i'm asking this question
 the problem is my father happens to have a girlfriend and she lives all the way in missouri so every week he goes up to kansas city missouri to visit her and ""work"" and stuff he usually comes back with a little money and a bunch of junk that he scraps or sells off 

  but he never leaves the ebt card behind and his trips have become longer and longer to the point where the past  weeks he's been at home maybe  days i never know how long it will last because last march he was gone for a full month this past week and a half i've had to pay over $ for food and necessities when i make just over $ a month before taxes and i have bills to pay 
he's never around long enough for me to communicate and if i bring up that he's taking the card with him or ask if he would leave it i expect he'll say something about how we have food and we aren't going to go hungry so we can wait for him to get back but my little sisters shouldn't have to eat cans of nearly expired green beans for dinner because he doesn't get groceries and it's coming out of my pocket

i am  single employed but making below minimum wage can i apply for food stamps even if i'm living in the same house as another person with food stamps i don't expect i'd get much as i'd be the only one on the paperwork and that's fine i'm not trying to cheat anyone i just need help"

the person i spoke to said they didnt get deposited because i have to do an interview
which is scheduled for dec  


at the end of july after weeks of fighting to reinstate my benefits that had been wrongfully suspended in may hhs agreed that the suspension was an error but i had to go through the application process anyways after completing that and having an interview my benafits were reinstated but for only half the amount i had been getting 
just grateful for anything
* done *


august i moved into a apartment after being homeless so i had to submit a change 
i submitted the change then i had to send lease bills income hit several bumps in the road but completed that
* done *


november received a notice to renew my snap and then another notice to renew my medicaid

"california - scared of calfresh overissuance i started getting calfresh junior year of college and it helped me tremendously regarding my finance

however i graduated may of last year/ and got an internship for the summer during then i earned over the irt and reported my income a few months late - right when my internship was ending no notice came like i expected so i assumed that my calfresh is okay and is continuing since i was unemployed from oct to dec

then in december i was hired for my full time job that i have now and i reported it right before my work started and because my job hadn’t start yet the worker told me to upload my paystubs online whenever they are available so that’s what i’ve been doing for the past few months and uploading my paystubs whenever they become available (every two weeks)

recently they have sent me a “semi annual reporting changes for your cash aid au and food stamp household” so i also reported it online along with all of the available paystubs stating that i’m currently earning over irt

however the county still has yet to respond to any of my update and income reports and i’m extremely anxious and scared that this would count as overissuance in the future

so my questions are:
) is there any chance that they would find that it’s my fault if they think that my case could be count as an overissuance
) what are some advices for the best course of actions right now

thank you so much

=================

tl;dr - i have been at least trying to report my income diligently but the county has not done anything or sent me any notice in regards to my updates i’m very anxious that in the future when the county finally updates my case they’d count my situation as overissuance because right now my financial situation is still not that good at the moment and i won’t be able to repay the overissuance"

"work requirement does self employed count edited to add: i'm in tennessee

i can't work outside my home but i do make money barely enough to survive bit it's something i got a letter stating that i am losing my food stamps march  because i am ""able bodied"" and i was told it's also because my son lives on the property and is not  yet (he doesn't live with me he has his own place)

i thought my income would keep me on food stamps plus a letter from my old gp saying i have a seizure disorder i guess not though 

so do self employed people just have to give up on food stamps or is there some trick i don't know"

"important - the rd stimulus bill renews maximum snap benefits for your family size if you qualify at all if you have hesitated to apply because you think you'll only get a few bucks now's the time to give it another shot

a friend of mine with  kids was only getting $ a month for the time being she has been getting $ a month() **she got some back-dated snap at this maximum level and she'll be getting over $ in snap through september **

note that it's higher than snap maximum benefit charts you may have seen because there is also a temporary % short-term increase to all snap benefits that is now extended through at least september and (as per the bill) should remain in place ""for as long as needed based on economic conditions""

tl;dr  **maximum snap for all those who qualify + % extra = big big help over the next  months** go apply"

"snap challenge (project for graduate class) **introduction**

i recently was given an assignment in my nutrition policies environment and obesity class called the snap challenge which gave me a view of the struggles that low-income americans go through to obtain adequate food for themselves and their families this challenge helped raise awareness of hunger in my community and it was very humbling knowing i can go to the grocery store whenever i want to buy anything i need below is a description of my experience and also a few tips/strategies i used to make my experience a little easier here is the link if anyone else is interested in trying this yourself: [

**my experience**

when i was preparing for the snap challenge i shopped at fry’s and was fortunate enough to be able to use their online website/app to help me prepare my list before going to the store this was extremely helpful since i was able to verify that the foods i was buying were eligible for snap/ebt and what aisle they would be located which helped decrease the amount of time i spent in the store i was able to purchase  items for $ which allowed me to maximize the amount of grocery items with the money i had available i have attached a copy of my grocery list to this post to help provide resources for anyone interested

**tip:** when using some grocery apps like the one provided by fry's food shoppers can see if certain grocery items are eligible for snap/ebt before going into the store to buy which can help decrease the stress of not being able to purchase an item when you get to the checkout

 **grocery list:**

 zatarain’s jambalaya mix ($)

 zatarain’s andouille smoked sausage ($)

 jiffy corn muffin mix ($)

 kroger grade aa medium eggs-  dozen ($)

 kroger % reduced fat milk-  pint ($)

 kroger fruit &amp; cream instant oatmeal packets-  ct ($)

 la banderita soft taco flour tortillas ($)

 chicken ramen-  ct ($)

 beef ramen-  ct ($)

**total: $**

**tip:** buying a premixed rice box allowed me to save on money i would have needed to spend on spices since all the different spices needed for the zatarian's meal was included in the box

below are a few recipes that others can use if they decide to purchase some of the same items as i have to help them prepare if they are wanted to take on the snap challenge

 **recipes:**

** zatarain’s jambalaya w/sausage and cornbread**

\-zatarain’s jambalaya mix

\-/ zatarain’s andouille smoked sausage

\-jiffy corn muffin mix ( egg / cup milk)

** sausage and egg burrito**

\-/ zatarain’s andouille smoked sausage

\- eggs

\-tortilla

** oatmeal**

\- packets kroger fruit &amp; cream instant oatmeal

\-/ cup % milk

in order to maximize the amount of food i had bought and the timeframe i was given i decided to cook a meal that i would be able to eat on two separate occasions for two different days this was the primary focus of my shopping trip and took up most of the available funds for the  days i was not able to incorporate as many fruits and vegetables as i normally do because i wanted to ensure that i had a larger meal that i could stretch out over a couple days and something that would be filling an example of my  day food log is shown below:

**friday march th **

**lunch**

*  chicken ramen

**dinner**

* zatarain’s jambalaya w/ andouille sausage
* jiffy cornbread

**saturday march th **

**brunch**

*  strawberry &amp; cream instant oatmeal
*  sausage and egg burrito

**dinner**

* leftover zatarain’s jambalaya
* leftover cornbread 

**sunday march th **

**breakfast**

*  banana &amp; cream instant oatmeal

**lunch**

*  beef ramen
* cornbread

**dinner**

*  sausage and egg burrito
*  blueberry &amp; cream oatmeal

**biggest snap challenges**

the most difficult thing about the snap challenge for me was having to plan so strategically to make the $ last for all the items i needed to purchase i had to be flexible with the choices of ingredients i wanted to use based on what was priced the best i changed my primary meal about  times before deciding to settle on the jambalaya and cornbread while i was shopping on the app i remember thinking how difficult this would be if i did not have internet/computer access i also would get even more frustrated having to plan as much as i did each week just to make sure my family was fed i decided to wake up later than i usually do on saturday so i would only have to eat two meals instead of three since i was running out of stuff to eat that i purchased specifically for the challenge during the challenge i was thinking about how often i would have to make large enough meals that i could have leftovers to eat throughout the week this would be very difficult for somebody who doesn't like to keep eating the same thing i feel like i was not able to make % of the decisions regarding what i wanted to eat this weekend it was dependent on what was on sale and what was eligible for snap/ebt"
"the new child tax credit payments &amp; assistance programs so i realize this probably isn't even ironed out yet but any guesses as to how the new monthly child tax credit payments are going to affect things like snap medicaid etc 

&amp;#xb;

i know usually tax refunds don't count as income because they're a one time payment thing but this is a monthly payment from july to december unless parents elect to receive it as a part of their usual tax refund was talking with a friend of mine who has several kids &amp; works &amp; she's worried that especially in larger families the payments could be high enough to push a family off the benefits cliff for at least some programs she asked me to look into it and try to find out in time to decline monthly payments &amp; opt for it all in the tax refund if it's going to put her into a worse situation by getting the monthly payments texas specifically but it's going to be a question for every state honestly"
"i reported an increase in income but they still paid out benefits hi all

my husband was out of work until his wc claim was approved (for lost wages) in the meantime i applied for snap benefits and was approved i was told if he got approved to report the income when he finally got approved i reported the income on / and i noticed that they loaded my card with the monthly benefit but when i checked my account it stated that my benefits were discontinued

my friend thinks that we may be able to use them but i do not want to get into trouble i'm in ohio btw

eta: we were behind on our bills and used his back wages to catch up so while we ""need"" them i still don't want to use them and get in trouble or commit fraud

"is ebt on the “honor system” my pregnant wife and i were approved this month for an ebt card—for something like $ a month—in arizona we expected to pay something like $ with the ebt card and then like $ with our own credit card at the grocery store self-checkout; we didn’t think the ebt card would cover the entire balance because a few items (eg artisan bread orange juice egg noddles) didn’t have the little orange “wic” symbol on the mylar—on the price tag—but it covered the entire balance

so then does an ebt card cover the entire balance are the recipients just supposed to be on “the honor system” (ie don’t use it for alcohol cigarettes etc)

i unfortunately can’t find any answers elsewhere online thank you"

"reporting income change- will i lose my benefits hi all i have been unemployed since march th due to covid i live in florida and applied on april nd i was approved april th and have been waiting ever since to receive my card in the mail i was finally able to get through on the phone yesterday (i thought the card may have been lost in the mail or never sent but since they said it could take up to  days i kept waiting and decided not to order a new one) and it turns out that the card was supposedly delivered weeks ago but was returned as ""undeliverable"" not sure why because they do have the right address the new one will hopefully arrive in the next  days anyway i have now been approved for unemployment and started getting payments from what i understand i have to report this change in income by may th and i believe it will result in me losing my benefits (the extra $/week puts me well over the income limit for snap) 

my question is- if i don't get the card in time to use my benefits from april ($) and possibly may will the money disappear from the card or will i just lose the benefits that were supposed to be put on the card for the months after i was approved for $ through august i'm upset because it turns out i should have had the card this whole time and they never notified me that it was returned (not sure if it was the postal service or my apartment building that messed up)- i really could've used the benefits for april before i finally got approved for unemployment and it would still be helpful since my first unemployment payment was used to catch up on bills thanks"

"partially damage ebt card my ebt card has been partially damage it's gone through slightly above average wear and tear the magnetic strip is obviously the only page that matters my card will still swipe at some stores but won't at the store i shop at most the store saw that my card wasn't working so the manager came over and said they have a policy where if the card won't scan that their is nothing they can do however they can take a physical imprint of one card and then manually enter it this was working for a while of time however when i went to that same store yesterday they refused to do it i asked to talk to the manager explained how my family and i spent 's a month because it was our primary store and that another manage was doing it manually for us this manager (claiming she's the big boss said their was no one working there that was higher ranked minus us calling corporate) said that this was never a policy and that they could never take imprints and enter it manually i find this hard to believe because if this was never a policy why would they have the equipment to do this and how would the one manager had known that it was able to be done either way we wasted an hour of our time and are now without food completely so my question is : if the card still works at some stores but not others is it possible for me to put in for a replacement without having my current card deactivated that way i could try it at a few other stores to get what i need to get by for the next week i know they deactivate it if you had it stolen or lost but i still have the card it is just worn out can i request a new one without this current one being deactivated or do they have to deactivate it no matter what i can't find a damn number for ohio that results in me talking to a live person every number i've found on google said it was for ebt but when i call it's for arizona or cali and they won't help me since i'm not in that state nor could they produce me with a number for live support in ohio the arizona lady said if i keep going through the menus for the lost/damaged card section that i'd eventually make it to a live person this has not happened i even tried the old tricks such as hitting wrong buttons delaying and not saying anything verbally saying help or operator and none of this worked on some phone lines if you keep saying the wrong answer or nothing at all they will say something a long the lines of ""we could not understand your answer please wait while we find you the next available operator"" none of that anyone know the answer to my question or what to do thanks in advance"
"rejected for cash assistance because i have too much income probably the wrong place for this but i don’t know of any other sub to post it to but i was rejected for cash assistance on the basis that i have too much unearned income 

i receive $/month in unemployment but my rent is $ 

i receive $/month in food stamps but that can only buy food 

and so that essentially leaves with me $ of real cash that i can spend for an entire month which doesn’t even come close to covering other basic essentials in my life like transportation being able to get to job interviews toiletries new socks or even paying my internet bill and or phone bill so that i can continue to apply for jobs

"denied for nj snap because of households i live in nj i am  years old and i am a full-time college student my school sent me an email a while back saying that i was eligible to receive food stamps but i've been denied i live with my mom and my grandfather who both receive food stamps and have for years i applied as a separate household because i do buy prepare and cook my food separately from them however i was denied because anyone under  who still lives with their parents has to be part of their household 

does this mean that i can reapply listing them as part of my household or just my parent as part of my household 

also will this application with them listed as part of my household let them know that i am applying or interfere with their food stamps and how much they receive

any advice you can give me as how to be accepted to receive food stamps would be helpful thank you"

"(oklahoma) what is the rationale behind who can and cannot be considered a separate household (per policy :--(b) in my state) i am actually a new caseworker so please let me know if this is not allowed i am curious about when this policy originated and how to explain the reasoning behind it to others for instance why can't a -year-old be a separate household from their parents even if they purchase and prepare food separately or why must two unmarried parents be on the same case due to having a child in common even if only one parent is primarily purchasing and preparing meals for the child

"single mom/daughter— what texas welfare/food stamps assistance should i apply for her father could be moving out soon and with all expenses alone i will need help making ends meet i would meet the low income requirements and i would definitely seek child support of course which wouldn’t be a substantial amount

"please help mentally disabled and don’t know how to respond to missing information form a roomate helps with rent ect (also want to get off snap food stamps) hi i am female diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder major depressive disorder have a valvular heart condition and bouts of insomnia i’m in my mid s in texas

in late  i was let go from my job because my employers didn’t think i was performing to their expectations  have been let go from  previous jobs for the same reason(not fast enough anxiety caused difficulty communicating fatigue affecting performance)

i am blessed however to have a dear and older friend who already had taken me in to live with them since the end of   i owe her my life also because she helped me leave a particular unhealthy environment

in late  my friend and roommate helped me get on food stamps  (she had previously helped me wih membership to a local charity based medical care)

my primary doctor diagnosed me with the prior above mentioned conditions and provided a form establishing medical disability and recommending not working

  the snap office has me as disabled and not abwad because of this doctors note
(a medical release from working)

i am not however on any sort of ssi
i had been applying for ssi disability since  though
(i was actually denied recently after the hearing and now waiting to hear back from disability lawyer on the another appeal type process)

anyways when my friend helped me get on food stamps she came with me to the food stamp office and gave the counselor a letter explaining that i would owe  a month in rent

in my roomates letter she states that if i can’t pay the  then she will cover it yet i will still owe it back at a later date
(it was appearing that i would recieve ssi disability and she intended that upon recieving it i would pay back the rent that had accumulated)

well she recently moved to another area of town and said i could still roommate with her in the new place

so after moving i called the food stamp office to simply report the change of address  they ask what i am paying a month

i proceed to explain there is a statement on file from my roomate that states i will owe  a month she will cover it if needed also that i am not working right now have a doctor medical release for disability and letter states that i will owe the total amount of rent at a later date
i assured her that the roommate statement letter and my medical info is there in the computer and at their food stamp office

so i recently received a letter from food stamp called a “missing information form a”
 they want to know the source and amount of the “gift” the  i believe is what they are referring to

yet the roomate statement letter already provided this “source” and has been on file since late   

during previous renewals they simply take the letter see that i am medically disabled and renew for  a month in food stamps and leave it at that

it is now past due from march  when they wanted a response and i still haven’t responded to the missing information form a

i already have daily heart palpatations shortness of breath and almost sleepless nights  this request for missing info is causing triple the symptoms little sleep i simply don’t know how to respond  i don’t want to appear dishonest or say something impropper
  my heart condition can’t handle this right now 
 i had already called ambulance for what i thought was a heart attack recently (having both anxiety and an actual valvular heart condition)

so i am considering going into the food stamp office this friday march th with my roomate to hand the same letter back to a food counselor in person

the lady on the phone could not see this information right  on the phone the way i explained it she thought it was missing information
i get that she was just going through her routine

is going in this friday to speak in person and rehand the same roommate letter rent statement sufficient
also will they accept this late response

also i have decided that i do not want food stamps anymore 
it is just something i want to let go of now  
it simply is not worth the  a month  i admit i didn’t fully understand the letter my roommate wrote up for me  

i now just want my food from local churches from family and likely growing it
i also want to try to work again and pursue interests that will enliven me again

my food stamps actually expire on 
april th  i also have not used the food card since feb  or so

my main questions are
what occurs if i don’t respond to this missing information form a at all
(request for source and amount of any gifts “source of  gift”)
then just let the whole food stamp expire without going in to renew it on april th

will that be it

or will food stamp then come back months later and say “ok you didn’t give us the info now you have to pay all of it back”

i have no job no income literally nothing  i already eat one meal a day  everyday is immensely challenging with my health as it is  i couldn’t even fathom being asked to pay all that back or getting into some kind of funk over this

could they come at me and say i was being fraud for not saying anything or for the way the roommate letter is formulated   and if they did want the assitance back could they take me away for not even being able to pay it back
i would literally run into woods and never be seen again

or would they just discontinue the benefits and forget about the missing information

could they say that my non-response was dishonest and try to say i was being a some sort of fraud  or say that the roommate letter of owing back rent at a later date was an attempt at fraud

or is going in and bringing the same old roomate statement sufficient
she is the one who covers the  of rent if i can’t cover it  since being let go from my job in  i have not been able to cover it at all

i have the impression i’m making more of this than it actually is

did the phone lady i reported my change of address to simply misunderstand me perhaps she did not have access on her computer to the roommate letter and information on my medical disability

again the missing information form said the due date to provide the information was march  its march th and i still haven’t responded
i will be potentially going in to the office in person this friday march th with my roomate to rehand the form
is a late response like this still accepted

i really just want to let this expire and forget about it  please let me know how i can provide them what they need re-clarify or how to simply let this food stamp expire i am ok with it

the computer also still shows me as disabled and not abwad as well

please if you any of you here can provide me the best choice of options  i would immensely grateful

please help  
much love and respect


ps
(i am not any cunning sort of person i have no intention of taking
i am perfectly ok with allowing it to expire with no food stamps
i do owe this friend my life as she helped me leave a particular enviroment  i don’t get any impression that she was attempting to take either  

now i just want let go of food stamps start over go back to church work anywhere i can and try to push myself back into society again)

"food stamps question could i get food stamps if i am a grad student the program does not allow me to work as stated in the school book or i could be kicked out if they find out

\-i am a single person in nys "
"i give away free government benefits all day long and all i get in return is entitlement lies and the occasional truly needy individual or family 
this is one of the most interesting positions i have ever been in due to the inherent hypocrisy that has been systematically engrained through entitlement and taking advantage of well intentioned programs i have worked for the state for  years and my position consists of giving out free tangible and extremely coveted products to people who a lot of the time feel entitled to these products regardless of circumstance or personal responsibility it is essentially a customer service position but instead of selling something i am giving things away for free it is also common practice for a person to consistently complain (using this word lightly) about receiving free food cash and health insurance due to it not being enough 

do you know how difficult it is to obtain health insurance if you are not disabled have a child in your home or have almost zero income it is impossible unless you can afford a monthly premium and a high deductible; which most people cannot this leads to an entirely different discussion which i will explore if inquired about my main point is how do you remain content and avoid burnout when the majority of people you certify for benefits do not work do not seek employment and have a general apathy towards a contribution to society now you also have a generation raised to believe that teenage pregnancy (resulting in lack of education) housing assistance disability payments free food medical assistance etc are all the norm; which in turn they will most likely pass on to their children

it begs the question how do you prevent a system that is negatively incentivized toward working if a client of mine begins to work their rent immediately increases all government assistance decreases and they lose medical insurance it perplexes me on a daily basis and i am curious to know what you all think about this topic

this is my first post on reddit so constructive criticism is encouraged

thank you"
"[nys] p-ebt confusion hopefully someone can help me up until last november my family was on food stamps and medicaid my husband started a better paying job so the food stamps were cut off we are still on medicaid i have a less than $ balance on my ebt card verified when i call so the card is still active both my kids got free lunch at school last school year so i believe we are supposed to get p-ebt benefits because we used to get snap and are still on medicaid i assumed it would just post to my ebt card so i kept checking all summer i never got a letter about it though i keep checking the balance over the phone and about  weeks ago the message after entering the last  of my card number/pin changed to ""a card with a dob of january  is considered a p-ebt card"" and goes on to explain how to set up a pin but my card has my birthday on it so i don't know if it's a general message (though i only started getting that message  weeks ago and i've been checking all summer) and i'm never given the chance to enter the whole card number only the last  digits of the card # and my pin (the dob message comes after) i know they said benefits and letters are going out into september but it seems like since i have an open ebt card and medicaid it should have been earlier in the summeram i mistaken i can't even figure out who to call or contact to find out everything says wait until you get a letter what if i don't get one i could really use the $ for food with both kids home all day every day now help please"

"one time cash refund for medicare my mother is getting a  time cash refund for her medicare payments that they have been taking out of her social security check all along she is no longer going to have to pay for it each month too how will this affect her food stamps not having to pay for medicare will bring her expenses down a little and may make them go down slightly but what about the lump sum is there an asset limit my aunt is telling my mother that ""the welfare will take it if they find out about it"" i'm pretty sure they wouldn't and it may not affect her food stamps at all because it's not regular income but i want to confirm it before my mother starts to worry

we are in ny (not nyc) my mother is elderly and very low income less than $ a month for a  person household

this is so confusing some sites say there is an asset limit but this one  says 

""what if i have savings

most households applying for snap no longer have to pass a savings/resource test in order to get snap benefits this means that the household's assets (stocks savings and retirement accounts etc) are not considered when determining eligibility"""

michigan bridge card questions at the beginning of the pandemic my work shut down and everything was uncertain so i applied for food stamp benefits because i didn’t know what to expect they determined i would get $/month which is low but everything worked out for me financially and i thankfully didn’t really need the assistance i happened to check my balance a few months back and discovered i had $ in food benefits i thought it was surprising because that came to more than $/mo i figured when i had time i’d go and buy a bunch of canned foods and donate them well i checked my balance again today and now it’s at $ how is this possible when i’ve never used my card that amount isn’t even divisible by  i just genuinely don’t understand how this was figured

"ebt card funds/benefits removed after activation making a post in aid of a family member will give as much information that i know of since i do not understand how any of this works nor know all the specifics about my family member's circumstances

family member residing in new jersey has two kids and has had a families first ebt card for months not knowing english and not being very savvy with these things they had not activated the card for probably months (i dunno when they received it) i recently helped them activate the card after figuring out that their p-ebt (pandemic-ebt) was probably put into that card instead of being delivered by mail we called the number present on the card itself and we had also spoken to a representative or whatever from that number that helped guide us this was two days ago

two days ago the card was finally activated and on the next day (yesterday as of this post) when trying to use the card for food there weren't any funds present family member then went to some office which i assume is related to ebt to figure out what happened and was told that yesterday at :am (just a few hours after having activated the card) all funds were removed from the card due to the card being inactive/never used initially upon activation there were around $ in the card (the phone number on the card has an automated system that tells you the balance) but the people at that office said that over $ was removed from the card due to inactivity

something fishy is going on here why were the funds removed coincidentally only a few hours after the card was activated and how come the balance spiked up by around a thousand within the same time frame keep in mind that only recently the state of nj gave out p-ebt aid to parents of which i would have expected at the very least those funds remain in the card

----

what i need help with is who can my family member contact or go to in order to sort this issue where can i find more information about this card as well as information regarding the expiration of funds from the card is there something legally fishy going on here thank you

i was wondering what i should do as far as reporting this or if i should just do nothing and continue to use the benefits until they expire in \~ months (someone who's been on snap benefits suggested this but idk if this is the most reliable info) even the report form on the snap website was super confusing

"cancelling food stamps quick question 

i've been on food stamps for about  months and no longer need them i was told to put a written request to have them discontinued

my question if i request them to be discontinued effective december   and had a $ load authorization to my ebt card on december   will they ask for that money back

won't spend it but just curious what would happen if i did wasn't sure if money previously deposited in the month is safe to touch or if that's a no-no

indiana snap hey guys so my renewal date is coming up for october nothing really has changed except that i moved to a place where rent is higher that before but i just couldn’t stay in the roach infested apartment but that’s already reported my question is when you renew do you need bank statements or just the bank balance because i had my mom let me borrow money to pay for my move out costs which obviously would reflect in the statements apart from my income would i have to let them know that or would they just automatically assume it’s extra income i’m just worried they’ll cancel out my food stamps because i get laid off temporarily for winter also i now have a  honda that i bought wrecked (salvage title) so i didn’t pay much for it and obviously it’s not worth as much nor do i owe anything on it i’m not gonna lie i was only able to afford it with my taxes could i get my food stamps taken away for having such a newer car apart from my old  daily driver

"if you have food stamps download fetch rewards i haven't paid a penny for my neccessities in months its an app that gives you money back for every receipt you scan and extra points if you buy the brand's and offers the money is redeemable by $ $ $ $ and $ gift cards and there are loads to choose from 

if you buy their offers with food stamps youd essentially be getting free money back since its not coming out of your own pocket they also have offers for household and personal products 

whenever someone uses your code you get  -  points so if you have your family or friends sign up you can easily make some money

ive had this app since july and got $ as of  weeks ago
its really helped me save my real money because ive been using gift cards to buy my neccessities or occassionally spoil myself

also my friend buys and returns things sometimes just to get the free points but i dont take it that far lol 

if you use this code you'll get  points ($) when you sign up and scan a receipt - qw

there are other similar apps such as ibotta but i dont think theyre as good as fetch ive earned $ since july on ibotta theres lots of extra rules too but i guess its still money

the  others i know are receipt pal and coinout but theyre slow you can have all these apps at the same time and download the same reciept on all of them

i hope this helps someone

when would be the right time for her to report that she has income coming in does she report it when she stops earning the extra $ an hour or does she report it once the whole pandemic is over she doesn't want to lose food stamps and she is worried that she might lose them for not reporting properly can someone provide some advice on what she should do please"

"question about illinois snap (cook county) i live in cook county in illinois and have some questions about snap

i am  years old and live with my mother i have no job and no expenses i live with my mother for free

my mother has received snap benefits for  years on behalf of herself and me this was due to me being a child originally

i somehow was removed from the household filing group due to a confirmed error at the office instead of adding me back the case worker said that he recommends i file a new application listing only me as being apart of the household and state that we purchase and prepare food separately from each other it would help me stay in control of my own life since i'm no longer a child and over  (my benefits would no longer be stopped or changed by her case) and he said it'd probably earn me more each month since i have no job or income or bills to be paid (basically $ for everything)

i questioned if this would be okay to do since i don't want to get in trouble for filing an application listing me as the only household member and stating zero income and zero expenses even when my mother receives benefits at the same address and she pays bills and he said ""you're  and have no income and pay no expenses and since your currently not even in the system as receiving snap a new application filed as yourself should pass without any problem just list yourself note that you prepare food separately and you're good to go at the interview just state you live with other family members but buy and make your own food this happens all the time""

is he correct i've had many issues in the past with caseworkers telling me straight up false information or these seemingly frequent ""case errors"" it just feels weird filing an application and saying ""no income no expenses just me in the household"" since how can somebody live in a household with no income and no expenses they can easily see my mother lives with me and i feel like that would get me in trouble for fraud

final question i was also told that ""abawd work requirements don't apply to you cook county in illinois is exempt from everything related to that"" does anyone know if this is also true i couldn't find anything about this online thanks"

i believe they should give us the benefits back though correct they were never used and were incorrectly issued which was their fault not ours i contacted someone about it in june and a supervisor was supposed to contact me back but did not

also i am disabled but i'm not on disability insurance or registered for disabled parking or anything i've been on snap in texas and ca; texas did not accept that i was disabled but ca has so info on states that have a more liberal take on who counts as disabled in terms of snap eligibility would help too "

if so while i can normally expect to only be given/work \~-hrs/week during the last pay period i worked approximately hrs/week &amp; that's the only pay period i can expect to work as much using that paycheck i believe it would put me outside the income limits (minimum wage $/hr) since they use those  paychecks to calculate your monthly income according to the clasp infogram ft college students working at least  hours and making less than $/yr who recieve snap have their expected financial contribution for fafsa automatically set to  and recieve more finaid so i'm looking forward to being able to send in my application and update my fafsa &amp; have my finaid adjusted if that's true

additionally i pay for most things myself (tuition clothes toiletries food transportation school supplies &amp; books etc) although i also live with my parents and do not pay rent (i've been for the housing lotteries for the past year or two--nyc rent and all) when it asks what kind of household i live in--am i expected to put room or home am i expected to put in the application that i recieve rent assistance from family members even though i do not pay rent because i live in their home for free or would that be unnecessary/overcomplicate and null my application i'm just afraid of filling it out wrong and unnecessarily complicating or lengthening the process

&amp;#xb;

thank you so much for reading all this and for any assistance or advice you may be able to provide  i greatly appreciate it"
"was told that i need to get new info from my boss but i'm worried about several things as i look for another job i've been working as a dog walker i'm technically an independent contractor/self employed even though i have a boss who assigns me my clients and makes my schedule 

there arent really any business expenses aside from the gas it takes to get from house to house but in order to receive food stamps i need to provide a letter from my boss saying that they dont cover the cost of my business expenses and they need to write what my bi-weekly average pay is (because my pay stubs weren't a good enough indicator for some reason) 


i'm worried about my boss being upset or seeing this as being criticized by me

i'm also worried that my boss will see that i'm in need of more money and then continue trying to get me to do a higher quantity of the lower-paying walks (some of these are really not cost-effective where i live + minutes of driving to walk a dog for  minutes for  dollars) and if i were to turn down the additional work my boss would suspect that i'm looking for a different job and let me go 


is there any way around this i'm pretty sure i should still qualify for snap even if my boss were covering my expenses"
"i need help please how do i fix this so basically i am out of work and had a child last year i got on food stamps and it has been a life saver but now i am doing my yearly review and all of a sudden they said i had to add my boyfriend now to the card because he is the father this has ruined everything for me this card is for me and my daughter only and we are broke as shit and now they are making me send in his taxes because he is self employed and he makes  dollars over the limit and i just got done speaking with an employee and they said i will not get my snap anymore because of fucking  dollars like i can't feed us with  dollars a month and i am so heart broken i need this money so bad and they are going to make us suffer because  dollars how can i fix this before i have to turn in the papers is there a way to get them to let me not have my boyfriend on the card  he buys his own food so it makes no sense to me why they are doing this

"new report: barriers to eating healthy on snap a new united states department of agriculture (udsa) study identifies the barriers that snap participants face when trying to achieve a healthy diet through a nationally representative survey of snap participants the study is available [here]( but i'm including the top level talking points:

 overall  percent of snap participants
reported facing some type of barrier to
achieving a healthy diet throughout the month 

 the most common barrier overall reported by
 percent of snap participants was the
affordability of foods that are part of a healthy
diet

 other environmental barriers reported by
nearly  percent of participants were lack of
transportation to a grocery store or the distance to
a grocery store 

 the most common individual or household barrier
reported by  percent of participants was lack of
time to prepare meals from scratch that are part of a healthy diet

 the prevalence of most barriers did not vary
by household composition income sources
education level urbanicity or region

 two barriers – affordability and lack of
cooking equipment or storage – were
associated with household food insecurity
participants facing an affordability barrier were
 times more likely to experience low or very
low household food security participants
reporting lack of equipment or storage were 
times more likely to experience low or very low
household food security"

"pennsylvania - adult children and disability as per the sub this question is about snap however it will be impacting my medicaid as well so any relevant info you can share would be appreciated

background:

* i am disabled and have been waiting years on my ssdi case but expect it to finally be awarded in the next few months
* i have one child who will be turning  in the next few weeks has graduated and works near minimum wage
* i have one child who moved out years ago but has fallen on hard times and needs a bed which i can provide  he also works at just over minimum wage
* i receive child support for my younger children
* added all together assuming i get the disability we will be making about $ more than the annual snap limit

questions:

* how will my disability play into the calculations
* is there any way other than refusing to house my older kid(s) to keep receiving benefits when i am awarded disability
* when awarded my disability i should receive a very significant retroactive payment most of which i owe to friends and family who have supported us while i have been fighting for ssdi how can i handle this without invoking the wrath of pennsylvania"

"access card snap balance shot up to $ i think this is an error not sure what to do i'm in pa and the other day my balance  which is usually a little over $ was $ i don't get nearly that much i called the number and it said the deposits came from lowe's two separate big deposits

so i'm guessing this is some type of mistake and not related to any of the covid relief bills that were passed and how the heck would i get a deposit from lowe's on my access card

i tried calling the department of human services in my state and they don't even let you wait on hold it just says ""all agents are busy"" and then it hangs up on you i'm not going to call  times a day dialing over and over until they have an agent free to talk so i'm not sure what to do

if it's an error obviously if i spent the money they are going to take it back from me at some point down the line when they get wind of it so i don't plan to spend it but i also don't know how much money of that is actually mine if it was an error so i don't know what to spend and what not to i'm trying to just keep it under my usual allotment

any advice welcome

&amp;#xb;

my state is pa

thanks

edit: maybe they were saying 'dohs(department of human services) and not lowe's that would make a lot more sense for anyone who's called the number to check your balance are they saying dohs phonetically maybe"

"friend applying for snap gets paid weekly with a job that follows public school calendar (continued from title) meaning that their monthly income is highly variable with zero income during winter break spring break summer etc 

because of this they're unsure how to fill out their snap application i assumed that when they got interviewed their income could be annualized ( weeks of income meant to cover  months) in which case their average monthly income would meet eligibility requirements however when i spoke to a snap intake worker in my friend's state i was told that they give no consideration to future income during the application process and that my friend's application would be considered on the basis of the average of their past two months of pay stubs if my friend's application were judged this way they would not be eligible as it would not reflect things like summer break a two month period out of the year where they receive no income 

the intake worker's statements seem to conflict with snap information supplied by dhs could the worker have been mistaken or could methods of income calculation including any consideration of *prospective* income vary from state-to-state"

so what do i do do i listen to them or listen to the snap application i don't want to incur any penalties for this"
"rule change - no politics greetings everyone 

the overwhelming majority in the discussion was supportive of banning political discussion on this sub while the mod team is not going to take a heavy hand on this this should not be construed as censorship or taking sides 

program policy policy changes and discussion of impact are totally fine  as are expressions of concern  worry  or frustration calling out or generalizing one group or another on a particular side of an issue  or perceptions of an ideology's support or lack thereof are not okay

"applying question alot of things on application and stuff was very confusing

""household""  was one of those a person said 

&gt; required household members are people with common children spouses children under 

on 

i don't rememebr on application anywhere or on ""household"" part where it even said anything like this

and none of the ppl working at snap even knew how to answer what was a 'household' and this info said by that person wasn't seen anywhere - and nobody told me it either literally nobody (do not think this would be that much different anywhere else)

&amp;nbsp;

only ""people with common children spouses children"" are required to put as 'households' 

i didn't even know that even you don't share food or anything then you don't have to put any roommates or anything even if you had  roommates for example that means there's   'households'  in a house building or place for example

top most important - rules probably not that different in different states i'd guess 
it's really bad that there isnt national rules across all places (that maybe other countries have more of) this whole different things in different states when there's so many states is terrible 

i don't know where the usa ranks for 'welfare' or what are the best rankings for 'welfare' topic but the entire experience was horrid the whole thing was incredibly confusing and a nightmare basically do not think it was worth all the trouble and time wasted


&amp;nbsp;

while this whole nightmare is behind me i still don't know and am wondering what in the world counts as a ""household""  so anyone with a 'private entrance' would count as a ""household"" if the only thing that is required  for 'household' is this

&gt; required household members are people with common children spouses children under 

then that makes it a whole lot easier and simplier this whole thing was a pain and totally not worth the immense and excessive cost and burden maybe i'm just in one of the worst places around all these snap people that didn't even know what a household was or any of the other questions when calling the 'snap number' that only had 'customer service ppl) that didn't know anything at all -- but pretty sure i'd guesss that there aren't really other places that would be better in any signifcianat way"

"fyi for hungry pennsylvanians: snap income limit increased from a [pa department of human services press release](

&gt;	effective october  pennsylvania will increase the income threshold for all applicants to  percent of the federal poverty income guidelines (fpig) with this change more than  additional pennsylvanians in more than  households will be newly eligible for snap and will receive on average $ a month

pa families with at least one elderly (+) or disabled household member were already subject to a % fpig income limit but for everyone else the income limit is increasing from % fpig to % fpig

this change is **in addition** to the annual cost-of-living (ie inflation) update to income limits and benefit amounts which will also go into effect on october 

tl;dr: if you live in pa and were recently denied due to being a bit over the gross income limit it might make sense to reapply starting october "

unfortunately ky's dcbs isn't very good at communicating changes like this 

you can log on to kynect to check the new date for your recertification  if it's anytime soon it's probably been pushed back six months  kynect - what use to be benefind - will show you login to kynect and then once logged in click 'benefits' on the left side and scroll down to see: 

you can verify this yourself and hear this recording by calling () - and pressing  

i did find references to some other states' public assistance departments announcing the same: that recertifications for cases were pushed back six months again due to the pandemic i think the usda recently reached out and offered this due to the surge in covid- activity happening again

our address is the same on all of our records i don’t want to do anything illegal but i also don’t think the state should be telling me to go around asking people for their ssns 

do they count as a member of my household if we don’t share food am i misinterpreting the application

my pantry and fridge are full i will be able to sleep so well tonight knowing that i no longer have to worry about feeding myself

my question is should i wait until my next review is due is a couple hundred difference something ill get in trouble for not reporting i dont want to have to update it every month if it drops back down again "

the california ebt website was revamped and relaunched at the end of april  since someone asked about this and i do it at least once a day i thought i'd share the registration process this is only for ca 


your first step is to go to *benefitscalcom* find the link that says *create new account* keep in mind this is not the start a new application tab  the create new account hyperlink should be right underneath the log in button

set up an email address and password answer the security questions (keep in mind it only likes one-worded answers so if you answer 'what's your favorite color' just write blue not aqua blue)

you'll receive a verification code via email most of the time it doesn't work (known glitch) if this is the case use the one sent via text message that works % of the time

once you're logged in find a link that says *link a case* you can use the last four or your social or your case number the case number will be case sensitive so make sure all the letters are caps if there is a zero in your case number can almost guarantee it will but the number  and *not* the letter o it should say ""congrats your case has been linked""

from there you can explore the site check your transactions and allotments and complete your paperwork when it's due it's very useful

good luck"

she doesn't think she can get food stamps because she makes about $ a month right now which is above all of different amounts that we can find online for a  person household 

but my big question is if her rent is $ would they be looking at the $ or the leftover $ 

obviously $ would make her eligible but probably not the $ 

i tried to get her to apply anyway just to see what happens but she ""doesn't want to go through the whole process for nothing"" hoping i can get some info that will convince her to apply because she's struggling big time and i hate seeing her like this

"homeless in need of food stamps - paradox not sure if i am interpreting the eligibility requirements correctly - seems to me after reviewing the rules that a homeless person (ergo no shelter deduction amount) who is working full time at state minimum wage ($/hr) qualifies only as follows:

gross monthly income = $

standard deduction = $

earnings deduction (% of $) = $

meaning % of the remainder = $

thus qualifying for $ - $ = $ per month

am i interpreting correctly  any suggestions"

"a few questions about re-certifying next month hi all so long story short: single mom of a  year old currently receiving $ a month in snap also receiving medicaid and wic ex-husband left us in january and pays a measly $/month in child support i was working in retail from october  until june  made $/an hour and barely worked more than  hours a week current state receiving snap benefits is virginia 

when my husband left us i applied for snap medicaid and wic to help make ends meet only started to receive $ a month in snap because my case worker told me that the child support my ex pays is considered income 

in june when i was laid off i notified my case worker and she made sure my termination was correct and all of that got bumped up to $/month in snap still receiving the $ in child support applied for unemployment but got denied applied for other jobs with no luck really  currently have a friend living with me to help make ends meet because right now my monthly income is $ from the child support and that's about it i receive no other help from family or friends 

in august i went back to school at my local community college and am a full time student i received the full pell grant refund of $ for the entire - school year the pell grant was split between the semesters pell grant covered my tuition classes cost and books i received an $ refund from my school for the leftover pell grant in october i don't know if i will receive another refund next semester for the pell grant and i won't know about that until march


problem : my ex husband is still receiving mail at my address will i get in trouble for food stamp fraud if he keeps receiving mail here i currently do not know his new address and have told my case worker that 

: will i have to report the pell grant refund to my case worker for my re-certification next month as income 

: my friend who lives with me is not on my food stamp case as she buys her own groceries but she is helping me make sure there is a roof over mine and my child's head she watches my child while i'm in class on tuesdays and thursday evenings is it right for me to assume my case worker will have to speak with her too 

and lastly will i be required to find a job or risk losing my snap benefits i really dislike being unemployed right now but it's either focus on school full time or work and have to pay who knows how much in daycare cost i am looking into a workstudy program at my school but i won't be eligible for that until after january should i mention that to my case worker as well even though it's not set in stone yet 

my re-certification interview is over the phone on the rd of december so i'm just trying to prepare myself for anything my case worker might ask i have a new case worker different from the one i interviewed with face-to-face with back in january guess i'm just nervous and don't want to risk losing any benefits for me or my kiddo thanks all"

"housing co-op with food service count as more than half of meals hi i live in california go to college and live in a [student housing cooperative]( the co-ops are off-campus housing (ie not university dorms) and the houses (as opposed to the apartments) also provide food service more specifically residents of the house provide most of the labor and this includes  cooked meal a day ( meals a week); the rest of the food (including leftovers from meals raw produce and other ingredients) are available for residents to use to cook meals for themselves my question is whether this qualifies as less than half of meals being provided by a meal plan

my question is connected to a provision in calfresh making that a requirement for eligibility as described in [this memo from  to all ca counties](

&gt;students who live in dormitories and receive more than half their meals from a meal plan are not eligible for benefits however if a student purchases a meal plan that provides them with fewer than half of their meals (ie ten meals per week) they may be eligible for calfresh benefits as long as they also satisfy one of the student exemptions (mpp section -) as well as meet all other eligibility requirements

i can't tell whether this includes my situation less than half the food i eat is prepared as meals (like they are in dining halls) but a majority of my food does come from the food that my room-and-board helps pay for

on a related note where can i access calfresh and/or snap policy directly i feel like that might help answer my question but i haven't been able to find it i also realize this specific situation may not be laid out in policy -- but then would it just be up to the discretion of the administrator reviewing my application"

"benifits if i move and rent goes up hello  i have been on ebt and i get rent assistance  with a housing authority for a few years  i have the chance to move to better area 

but the thought occured i have no idea how my ebt benifits would change if i do this  i would be moving across state lines ( arkansas to missouri ) and the rent would increase 

 i tried to find a site online to see how the ebt benifits would change if my rent increased xyz dollars  but i didn't find it i am single currently i have no dependents    is it safe to  assume it is more complicated than the ebt just raises  the same amount as the rent increased

"calfresh // renewal application hi guys i hope you are all doing well i had a couple questions because i'm a little confused 

so i got a series of letters in the mail a couple months ago saying i had to renew my benefits / which was fine 

the first letter let me know that my benefits were ending soon and that i needed to renew them and that a separate letter regarding my phone appointment information will be sent soon 

the second letter let me know that i had to make a new application (which i did) and submit it in april 

the third letter i received finally gave me my phone interview information 

but at this point i had already submitted an application on the benefits website is it okay that i did that also is it okay that a submitted a *new* application instead of a *renewal* application i wasn't aware there were two different kinds because the letter i received stated to just make a new application should i try to fix it or just wait for my phone interview appointment 

any and all help is appreciated thank you"

"should i file for a fair trial case we live in nm

long story short: i'm a full-time medical student and for obvious reasons cannot work however i don't receive financial aid since i am on a full-ride scholarship my wife is the only one working full-time and is bringing in \~$ per month this is with a $ rent with \~$ in utilities and electricity each month (i also applied for liheap) leaving us with about another $ for the month

up until this month we were receiving full benefits of \~$ per month now we were dropped to \~$ per month and this is apparently since i don't meet the requirements for benefits and my wife is the only one who does i asked what changed and it seems it was because no one had really looked at our case file until recently and finally noticed that i wasn't working nor ""looking for work"" or receiving financial aid

we have some money saved up but we're afraid it won't last all that long using it for groceries (which we would spend \~ per month) obviously we're going to talk about a budget now but this is such a drastic change therefore do any of you think it would be rational to file for a fair trial to at least receive a little more snap benefits"

my question here is how can a case still be pending after receiving a denial notice and the automatic system stating there are no active or pending cases can new cases not be approved over the phone because everyone i have spoken to has stated there is nothing they can do and all i can do is wait to be approved i have been trying to get approved for benefits for  months now and even though i did not send the correct thing the first time i applied it was not my fault that the woman i spoke to did not tell me the correct thing to upload i went through the entire process of applying and uploading documents again it has been over  days and i am told my application is still pending even though the online portal states that i was denied according to the case worker i spoke to literally all i can do is keep waiting until i miraculously receive an approval for a denied application is it just me or are the correct procedures not being followed for assisting individuals here in kentucky any help or information would be greatly appreciated"

snap sent me another letter at the end of december saying the cost of living increase may affect my snap benefits but it didn't say by how much it said i could check using the ebtedge app and clicking on the ""benefits tab"" but i downloaded the app and there's no tab like that in mine i've clicked on basically every link in the app and nowhere does it say how much i will be getting in january or even if i'm getting anything at all i can see my past benefit transactions but nothing for the future so now i'm scared that means that i've lost my benefits entirely because of the col increase but wouldn't they send a letter specifically saying i'm no longer eligible

"i need help with general snap application/eligibity questions and alabama specific recently impoverished completely clueless hello i am trying to apply for snap in alabama but before committing to the process i have some important questions about my specific situation

 i live in my vehicle at an address where there is a household with my relatives who are letting me park and live near the property so theirs is technically my mailing address but they are not my household nor is mine theirs will there be any issue using this address in my application if i'm applying to snap just for myself and will there be any issues from the fact that i dont' technically live at the address but am using it to receive mail and packages despite that i don't live in that house i did live inside the house previously last year while i was working and tax and census information had me living there but this situation has changed to me now living in my vehicle on the property with permission and using the mailing address
 is it possible or feasible to complete my registration entirely online i am at high risk for covid- though i cannot show anything medical or official to prove it and my state's population is not taking it seriously putting me at even greater risk from going out for things like a snap in-person interview or presenting proof of my identity in person alabama's website application form does show an option for ""request a phone interview"" but it gives no details as to what that entails or the extent of it can i expect that it will be possible for me to complete all registration steps remotely mailing emailing or whatever proof or pictures of my identification even
 i have a small amount of money in my bank account a couple thousand dollars but that is basically already spoken for in ongoing personal payments and purchases i will need to make to live sustainably in my vehicle which is why i am applying for snap so i will actually have access to food to live on and not have to sell my vehicle (quickly) and live under a bridge just to be able to eat is having this little bit of money going to count against my application for snap so am i \*forced\* to expedite spending it on other living necessities ahead of time before applying or i might be denied
 is any of this stuff that i can or even should ask when calling my specific local resource for snap benefits i feel like i should find out for sure about a lot of this before even making contact so i don't waste time because i don't have a lot of time left to get this going before i start to go hungry

&amp;#xb;

edit: additional information about my circumstances that i have no idea if it will impact my application- i quit my job near the end of last year due to health reasons which due to lack of money and no insurance were left untreated all the way into the current crisis i was unable to visit a doctor so there is no proof or paper trail of this that i can provide so i have not had an income since the end of last year other than tax returns and the covid stimulus and still will not for the foreseeable future as my health is still poor (persistent lung infection) and the nature of it puts me at high risk in a state that is still being reckless about the spreading of covid-

&amp;#xb;

any information or pointing me in the right direction will help thank you"

"[california]- where to buy sprouting seeds as the title implies looking to buy sprouting seeds- broccoli red clover radish alfalfa etc with snap small-ish quantities - lb bags etc  broccoli is the main one i'm interested in  
amazon carries them amazon accepts snap but they can only sell snap eligible items themselves  (""sold by amazon"")- items sold by rd party vendors are not available using ebt card as payment method no sprouting seeds available sold by amazon  
i've been googling and searching to no avail  
i prefer mail order but i'd drive in the northern la area  
could conceivably be a commercial nursery supply that sells seeds in bulk to farmers but they have to accept snap

"fl – income from sales of securities (stocks) cryptocurrencies and dividend i sold some stocks and cryptocurrencies on robinhood on late january and february  robinhood provides a confirmation of the transaction which show how much i sold at which price and the total i made but don’t specify how much i paid for the stock when i bought it  the difference between which i paid when i bought and the selling price is my real gain i have the following questions:

- does the dcf will assume the total sell price is my gain or i have the chance to specify the buying and selling price so the real realized gain is what is accounted for

- i read that i’m supposed to inform the income  days after i receive it in the letter the dcf send me said that i just have to inform the agency about any income that go over the threshold but i did (and probably will do) many transactions on different days due to market fluctuation should i inform the dcf of every transaction one by one in batches every  days or i wait till the next revision given that all are small transactions and i don’t get over the threshold  my main concern is that i don’t know how much profit i’ll do since i sell if i have and opportunity so i don’t want to find myself in a position that i make a big gain at the end of the month that position me above the threshold but haven't informed of transactions at the beginning of the month because i thought i wouldn't have such gains at the end

- about dividends  all my dividends are in a dividend re-investment program (drips) so the money get reinvested without my intervention but for irs purpose i have to inform them anyway it works the same for the dcf even if the dividends are quantities that globally amount to less than  dollars a month and i don’t get access to them

thank you very much for reading my questions  all advice is appreciated"
"ebt deposit after change submitted i submitted a change that would indicate our family no longer qualifies for food stamps it was submitted on time according to the guidelines it's been over a month since submission and the status continues to be ""sent"" that says to me they haven't even looked at it yet then we got february's amount deposited to our account  can they take that amount back once they finally look at the change i sent in because we shouldn't have received it but i did send them the information according to the rules there was a previous balance on the card that we did qualify for and i understand that should be ours to spend regardless it just seems bizarre to me that they wouldn't have updated our case in time to stop receiving benefits

i'm a bit super scared cause i've been on snaps for awhile and every time filled in the forms properly the only issue that i could even think of is that the envelope got ripped very slightly in the corner and i taped it up a little even then tho they would still have the files on hand

is or has anyone else been in this situation where its been halted or closed due to them just not checking at all covid really has impacted a lot and just genuinely skiddish now ahaha"

"ebt randomly not working on certain items i recently found out that i was still getting ebt because of covid relief which i am grateful for 

however the last few times i've went to the grocery store i've had random items being excluded

the other day i went to kroger and grabbed some of their think protein/nutrition bars i know some of the workout bars are excluded but for some reason it accepted one of the bars and not the other both were the same exact bar but different flavors so why would one be excluded and the other not

also went to walmart yesterday to grab some frozen vegetables threw in a single pack of kit kats to curb my sweet tooth and those didn't get approved either

it's strange because i've bought things like the protein bar and candy bars before (i'm not one of those people that loads up on little debbies and doritoes with my foodstamps)

"forgot to report new job/income i recently got a letter in the mail for my six month report form seems pretty painless until i remembered that shortly after graduating undergrad last month i started a new full-time position since it's full-time and more money than the part-time positions i had during college it will put me over the income limit to qualify for snap however i started that role on may th it's june rd some of the requirements for snap is that you have to report new changes for jobs/income within  days i've read in past posts that it isn't quite a big deal and that you usually have to pay back the overpayments i'm fine with that i plan on calling my local office tomorrow to explain that i forgot to report my new job and hope that i don't get banned from the program it completely escaped my mind that you have such a short period of time to update them 

my question is - what will happen to my current balance if i am banned i've been receiving additional benefits during the pandemic so it's quite a hefty amount i know that i won't qualify to continue receiving benefits due to being over the income limit but it helps to have some kind of money already set aside for groceries i just graduated so i'm not really that financially well-off"

"question about gross income test for households with disabled members my household has received snap benefits for several years; at the bottom of every letter is the same boilerplate info:

&gt; for food assistance benefits the only change you must report during your certification period is when your household’s
monthly gross income is more than your income limit of $ 

however being a home with disabled members who receive ssi it's my understanding that we're exempt from a gross income limit test 

from the [usdagov site](

&gt; most snap households must meet both the gross and net income limits or they are not eligible for snap and cannot receive benefits  **however a household with an elderly or disabled person only has to meet the net income test**

from my state's policy manual in the [calculation of benefits section]( (pdf link):

&gt;  budgets and tests (fs)

&gt; assistance groups must meet the gross income standards to be eligible for food stamps with the following exceptions:

&gt;  **assistance groups that contain an elderly or disabled member and are not categorically eligible must meet the net income limits**; and 

&gt; standard filing units (sfus) that are broad-based categorically eligible must meet the % gross income limits

i've been working with a targeted case manager to plan a safe transition off of benefits as i increase my income (which is happening at a snail's pace but at least is starting to trend upwards at last) so this came up in that conversation we felt i should clarify whether or not i needed to report gross income that went above the amount in my notification letter even if my household still qualified by net income limit standards when we're in between recertification applications

so i called dcf and the representative insisted that there's no such thing as not using the gross income test for any household no matter what disability has no bearing on gross income tests i asked to be put on a list for a supervisor to call since frankly i frequently get wrong info from entry-level reps the supervisor repeated the same information however i should have pulled up the policy manual while i was on the phone but i was flustered at the time by the attitude the supervisor was giving--which was that i was crazy to think such a rule existed even when i read it out from the usda site i asked him to tell me where i would find the info in the state's policy manual since he insisted those were the only rules that mattered and he said i'd have to google it 

i asked if there was another number i should call another office i should consult about policy itself rather than specifically my case and he just said ""tallahassee"" (being that i'm in florida) and gave me a general line to the dcf office there the directory operator that answered the general questions line had no clue where to transfer me to in order to get an answer she sent me to client relations where i left a voicemail and am now currently waiting on a call back

i just need a little help if anyone can perhaps provide more context or understanding about how to properly navigate this question or what type of person within dcf might be best suited to answer it i'm just trying to make sure i follow the rules while i try to improve our circumstances without any surprises cropping up at least as best as i can"

"why did the cashier give me cash back when i used food stamps to pay disclaimer: this happened in missouri &amp; i do not have cash assistance on my ebt card (even after this situation i called my ebt card and there was $ in cash assistance and i never applied for cash assistance nor received it so then i called fsss and spoke to someone to see if there was a mix up and she proceeded to tell me that there is no way i am receiving cash assistance (so plz don't say that in the comments haha i am % sure that is not the reason this happened lolll)

&amp;#xb;

today at the grocery store i told the cashier my budget was $ and that i could not go over that amount because i didn't have any other method of payment so before scanning anything he entered into his computer a prepaid amount of $ 

(ie; when you go to a store and tell the cashier you want to pay $ in cash so the cashier enters the $ first then charges the rest on your credit card)

&amp;#xb;

at the end of checking out my balance ended up being $ something neither him nor i caught on so i swiped my ebt card for the prepaid amount of $ after the card was approved his register popped open and in cash he handed me $  since i only had $ in food but was charged $ on my stamp card i assuming the cash back was a reimbursement from the card being over charged

&amp;#xb;

what do you all think i feel like if that was the case people would go around telling cashiers to charge a certain amount to their card just to cheat the system so sad that this is even a possibility i know so many people that should be eligible for snap but have been denied due to being married or some other odd reason while there are people out there illegally selling snap or maybe even doing things like what happened me today but instead of accidentally they're doing it intentionally 

&amp;#xb;

what do you all think"

"will i owe back benefits sorry florida thought i put it in the title

i posted a few weeks ago about having to recertify by mid july but my husband started work in the beginning of july he wasn't paid until after the deadline for me recertification (actually i don't think he was even paid until after the deadline to send in employment verification) he was working a short  week job out of state there was a  week ""state employee"" pay delay and then another  week delay bc it was a bi weekly paying job idk it was a mess he ended that job and i wasn't able to get anything to send in to verify that employment (i could send them in not bc i finally have them but i couldn't by the date they wanted them by) either way that little amount will disqualify us so i said whatever i'll just reapply in september i got a notice from florida dcf that we are ineligible for benefits for july august and september but we had already gotten the benefits for july in the beginning of the month well before the recertify date am i going to have to pay those back since they're retroactively saying we are ineligible for july we're back to having no job and i just got all confused with how to report the out of state income there were only  paychecks from that job i'm sure i explained everything poorly but i'm hoping i don't owe july's benefits back if anyone could help i've tried to call but we all know how that goes


oh and i called i guess the district office or something and the guy i spoke to said to not report until we have a paycheck in hand just recertify and then send in the stubs when they ask for them but that we would be good for july since the recert wasn't until halfway through the month 
thanks sorry"

"question about ""irs standard mileage rates"" in regards to medical travel for snap/calfresh  long story short a recent revision to the calfresh policies guide is incorrect and is detrimental to calculating medical milage for excess expenses the guide is listing that the rate for medical transportation costs by private vehicle be calculated by using ""irs standard mileage rates"" and they go on to use an example scenario but they calculate using the ""irs medical/moving rates""  this guide is tops the list when doing a google or duck duck go search on ""elderly and disabled medical expenses"" (or something like that)

this new and revised guide cites acl - for its new revisions however this actual acl indicates in no uncertain or vague terms indicates that the state will use the irs business mileage

i am very interested in this because i travel between  and  times a year to get medical treatment and each trip is  miles i also drive  miles a month just for general medical 

i have had no problems in the past with medical mileage being used at business rates but i am in the middle of arbitration for a hearing scheduled for miscalculated benefits if this “revised” guide is either discovered or used then i have no doubt that my local calfresh office will jump on it currently medical mileage is $ and business mileage is $ this is a big difference when determining a budget that includes  miles a year minimum

who do i report this mistakes to i have made quite sure that i am not misreading anything or using old/outdated information i don’t want to have anyone else deal with this in the future and i want it cleared up so that some random worker won’t come along and change my deductions/expenses  have included links to upddated guide and the corrosponding acl's

"bank account balance question i'm attempting to help an impoverished family determine eligibility / apply for food stamps in michigan they are a couple with two minor children making under $k/yr they own a house and have a mortgage payment but live a frugal lifestyle and try to keep upwards of $k in order to have some reserve for utilities bills etc 

it looks like michigan requires a total bank account balance under $ if no one in the home is over  or has a disability 

can anyone explain how this works can they just allow their account to run under $k before applying or do they need to actually maintain under that limit for the duration of benefits for a somewhat fiscally responsible family with low income it seems to be that keeping such a low balance would risk overdraft fees when there are mortgage and bills on autopay"

when i called in to tell them my husband was home from the hospital in december the girl put me on hold and came back and congratulated me on the birth of my daughter and said she had added her to the account   so i had to start over and tell her what the real situation was when they failed to add him back in after that i called and waited on hold for an hour and was told i needed to submit a new application for a family of  with current information keep in mind it has been less than  days since we were originally approved and that application was a family of three not to mentioned literally nothing else has changed

before i call in and wait on hold for an hour again can anyone tell me if this is normal procedure one of the letters said he can't get snap because he ""doesn't live in the home"" he has always lived in the home he was just in the hospital for an extended period of time and even after being told he's home and providing someone to verify that for them they never added him to the case i'm really at my wit's end with most things right now and mistakes like this are way more than just a minor inconvenience"

"approved for snap  days ago still not ebt card - not sure if my medicaid card from  would still work forgot to put this in title - i am in ny

~~i saw benefits cards don't expire so i'm not sure if i'm supposed to be using this one since it was for medicaid or still be waiting for a new one to arrive should i call and see what's up or does it take this long for a new card to arrive the website says no more than  days but i have no idea if it's delayed because of covid~~

update: i called the ebt hotline and was able to change my pin in less than  minutes as it's an automated system leaving this up in case anyone else gets confused also it is open on sundays because it's a robot and worked right away to make me a connectebt account"

north carolina family of five with baby on way this month approved for $ with prorated first month of $ and the max amoun possible is $ my husband only brings home $ a week assets $ or so total (not over) rent  utilities  gas  car insurance  (i don't remember if that was included so don't mind me) phone  the case worker only asked for proof of rent for deductions but then my dad said deductions shouldn't even matter since our income is way low didn't ask for proof of utilities etc so why didn't we qualify for maximum benefits

"will my abawd status change if i get disability kind of a weird question i've been on food stamps in ohio since august  at the time i applied i had an authorized representative fill out the application for me she was a medicaid rep at the psych clinic i visit

anyway after the application i received a letter with an interview appt when i called for the interview i was told the representative had already completed the interview for me didn't think anything of it

i was approved for food stamps and on the income it said i had no income  when i applied i was in the middle of getting back on ssdi (long story my benefits got suspended) so i thought everything was okay but it was weird because i got a letter asking for verification of income which i didn't have so i just uploaded a letter from social security saying my benefits had been suspended and that i wasn't receiving any income

five months later i decided to look up my case on their website and in the employment section they have me listed as self-employed as a freelance writer since  which i was in  what's funny is no one mentioned anything about employment or told me i had to report income i honestly didn't even know they had me down as employed because the medicaid rep did the interview for me this makes me wonder what she told the food stamp office because they must have asked her how i'm employed if i'm receiving no income which she should have told them i'm not because i explicitly told her when she was filling out my application i wasn't employed and was in the middle of applying for ssdi

this had me worried but the good news is that my ssdi was approved and i got a letter stating my food stamps had been reduced due to a rise in income so the office definitely knows i'm on ssdi now 

my question though is does this change my status for work i probably should just call and ask but this whole situation has me nervous i can get in trouble i had the medicaid rep removed as my authorized rep last week because honestly i'd rather be the one talking to the food stamp office since the rep clearly didn't report my situation correctly  

i guess all of this is complicated because of covid as well i called the office and asked what the work requirements are because of the suspended work requirements in effect the lady on the phone didn't even know and gave me the number to the local specialist office which didn't answer 

anyway sorry for the long post i'm just curious if i'm considered exempt from the work requirement now that i'm on ssdi

"nevada- re-applying for snap hey guys i have a question (and concern) about re-applying for food stamps in nevada 

just some info on the situation: earlier this year i applied for snap and i got approved i work part time so it helped me out a ton once the pandemic hit i got unemployment for a couple months and because of that my snap benefits were terminated luckily at the time i didn’t have to panic because the unemployment payments were enough however i’ve been back at work for a few months now and i need to get back on food stamps 

i just figured out how to “link my account” or whatever and i’m about to fill out the application my question is i’m just wondering if i’m allowed to re-apply like it isn’t illegal or against any rules or something like that i’m genuinely applying because i need to i live with roommates but i’m the only one applying no one i live with is receiving unemployment/snap benefits (nor any government type benefits) i don’t know if that affects the situation i called multiple different numbers but i can’t get through to a human to ask questions and i’m not sure if i can just file a completely new claim or do i do that by doing a new application that’s what i’d ideally like to do 

thanks for any info/advice to anyone who can offer it"

"posted about food stamps not refilling but now i have an update update:i posted earlier here about food stamps not refilling (found [here]( and i finally sort of found out what happened

i was unable to get through to anyone about my stamps by calling (always busy etc run around between card and number and no email provided to contact for help) so i sent a digital application for food stamps (never did this before but it was something made possible through their new mibridges site) with a message at the end (they allow comments at the end) with my current situation and asking them to email me

i got an email back about an hour later (wow that was pretty fast) basically saying i was denied because i share my stamps with others (i do not nor did i ever put that on my renewal application) that my case worker tried to contact me by phone (i haven't received calls outside of family for the past few months but i do have issue with my phone not receiving some calls) and that i should have received a denial letter (i also did not receive this but i did receive a letter saying i was approved for renewal i should have saved all this to a folder i'm really dumb for not doing that but i can't even find the information for these letters through their digital site for the denial or approval so i don't really know what is up with that)

who makes the boxes  
who decides what goes in the boxes  
what about fresh fruits and veggies  
what if you don’t receive your box one month  
what if you’re homeless  
what if you don’t have a place to receive mail  
what if you have allergies  
is the value of the box the same as the value of the snap  
what’s the overhead cost  
do folks receiving government assistance deserve to get to choose their own food  
does the box change based on family composition  
will companies be able to lobby to change the contents of the boxes  
will the government accept free food from companies  
what happens during hurricanes snowstorms  
what happens if shipping costs go up

"approved over a month ago but still haven't received an ebt card i was approved well over a month ago for calfresh ebt when i called ebt card services they said the county has a hold on the card i called the worker assigned to me and he said there is nothing he can do i then called the county directly and they transferred me to a supervisor who i left a message with yesterday morning

should i continue to wait for a call-back from the supervisor how long should i wait is there anything i can do besides going directly down to the county in person i have severe social anxiety just being around people can give me panic attacks

update: i have yet to solve this issue but here are more steps i have taken i contacted my social worker again he gave me my ebt card number so i can enter it into ebt card services phone number for lost cards it reports that it is 'unable to access account at this time' i re-called ebt card services and did not enter any numbers to get to a person the person said the card is labeled 'to be printed' and cannot be changed to lost saying 'unable to change' i have left another message with my worker detailing this and am waiting to hear back

update : my worker was able to sort it out by contacting card services directly himself i'm not sure what was going on exactly but everything is now ok and a card is being sent my way i am not able to articulate myself well enough to people and some miscommunication occurred when i first contacted my worker i guess"

well now that they got their card back they recently received a letter in the mail stating to call for a phone interview about benefit renewal or something along those lines even though they already renewed their benefits last month online they had until the end of this evening to call but they didn't get the letter until this afternoon and the letter was addressed days ago they had an hour to call and the entire time they were stuck on hold for over an hour the letter stated that if they did not call their benefits might be cancelled so far they said it hasn't been cancelled as they can tell but i am wondering if my friend could get in trouble for this 

my friend genuinely wanted to help someone out since they did not have food my friend did not get anything in return so it wasn't trafficking i am just worried for my friend and hoping that they don't get in trouble if anything it should be the person who took advantage of my friend's card but it's not my place to put my two cents in

"ebt snap benefits - cash back rebates does anyone know if the cash back rebate apps like ibotta fetch couponscom coinout and others actually work 

like can you just buy the specific food items that these apps tell you to with your ebt food card and then you get a small bit of real cash back somehow 

is the exchange rate or point system even worth trying it 

has anyone done this is this not considered fraud or scamming 

i suppose there wouldn’t be a way to really tell if someone was guilty of fraud if you’re just purchasing food items for you to actually eat 

i’m curious because i already spend all of it on food a month and if there is a way to help me financially while i’m using the food stamps for what they are intended for then that would make my life easier

also i drink a lot of soda and always have cans leftover does anyone recycle them for money is that considered fraud 

thanks a bunch"

"do pre-tax benefits qualify my family for snap-in nj  so my dad was able to do this career training program while on unemployment

**sorry for the long post**

before we were on medicaid snap and other gov benefits so we just trying to budget the loss of benefits and understand what it like to be on a salary again the job pays lower as an entry but like some other jobs pays more after you do couple of years

i don't want to sound like we are trying to take advantage but more money would help finances alot till the ""entry"" phase is after

i found out about pre tax payments such as health insurance fsa and others(ks) that lower gross income if i doing my math right this would lower gross income to that would qualify for snap

info:

family of 

my dad new yearly salary will about $-(if over time pay to the max sometimes )

if i count the $- monthly so $- yearly ( dad looking to picking higher insurance premiums plan due to to family having chronic health problems but my dad need to read which one better though lol) and the fsa of say $ yearly (co pay numbers hurt alot though still; we are not going to be used to paying alot for health insurance ) 

that would make gross income drop due to pretax payments if i read the reddit threads right lol \*\*$--\*\*ish

this is not including k pretax but read that it counts sometimes but it around(% auto for now so $ a year) but not going to count that for now i guess my mom works part time and makes around $- a year

so i guess yearly gross income (taxable) would be around **-** a year

i see **nj** max income limit for family of  is $ so if i am right does that mean my family would qualify for snap still or when they mean by gross income do they include the pretax things as well

just trying to understand how pre tax benefits lowering gross income also means the lowered gross income counts for social programs this is pretty new and my dad confused on what counts or not

kinda hurts knowing how if you try to move on you might lost alot of benefits discouraging better job moves if health costs were lower maybe this lost of benefits would hurt less :( 

thanks for the help though "

"louisiana snap income eligibility tl;dr- when an applicant submits a change in income that is just under or over the max limit do they take into consideration the monthly expenses other than bills or do they not really care and will disqualify said applicant 


i'm already receiving benefits for my son and i but i want to add his dad to my account because we run out of our foodstmaps before the next month

a little context to my situation- i applied in  as just me and my son and reported no income and no bills being paid (living for free at the time) then hurricane ida destroyed our home and were now living in a fema trailer (temporarily as we're told by fema)- none of the current new info has been updated with snap as i'm afraid i'll be cut off completely and i really do need it

 the max monthly gross income is $ and the max net monthly income is $ 
i don't work and haven't updated my info and told them we are paying bills now (we weren't before) and i'm worried that if i add him we won't qualify anymore 
he makes roughly k a month (bi weekly pay)-- just over the net income eligibility and just under the max gross pay 
my question is do the caseworkers look at *just* the income or do they also consider the bills we have to pay and that we only get paid every two weeks we pay utilities car insurance phone bills wifi credit card bill gas personal care and its still tight with our foodstamps should i wait until our temporary living situation with fema has settled before adding him (we may be having to pay rent or a big loan back in the near future) or try now and possibly be cut off completely i don't think it's worth the risk if they really don't care about what our pockets look like after we pay all of the necessary shit anyways thank you for reading if you made it this far"

"politics and programs good afternoon  morning  evening  or whatever time zone you're currently in and salutations from your friendly neighborhood mod team

we've had a few incidents crop up - last night most recently - of discussions devolving into political mudslinging /u/songofstorms and i talked this morning  and my thought is that  particularly with the already-early tones of the oncoming political season /r/foodstamps is a place that needs to be kept free of that sort of thing 

i strongly suspect that as we get closer to november even mentioning candidate names regardless which one  is going to end up descending into partisan vitriol i don't think anyone comes off looking good as a result of that  regardless of where your political leanings lie or how morally right you may or may not be

i'm suggesting  therefore  that as a sub we adopt a strict non-politics rule this is going to be a little difficult - it is after all a government program but i'm confident we can discuss program specifics or changes without dragging fault or finger-pointing into it i had thought to go ahead and just do it  but i think it's always best to get consensus

i also dumpster dive a couple of nearby grocery stores  one provides me with more meat than i can eat  (that included a rib eye steak and a whole ham i'm still eating off of a couple of weeks ago)  the other provides me with far more fresh fruits and vegetables than i can eat  i usually pick out ten pounds of oranges and a bunch of lemons and limes to squeeze on my  mixmaster model  mixer with the citrus squeezer attachment i have

i just found out today that i am under food stamp fraud investigation i am self employed and they said because i didn't make enough money to pay my bills that i was being investigated 

i did receive some christmas money last year that helped me from being homeless also i reapplied this year and was approved in late january 

in late april i received a large gift from a friend which was a godsend i called in today to tell my office that i didn't know if that the gift counted as income and i thought that in new york assets weren't counted i'm very confused she then asked me if the fraud investigator had contacted me and i said no i asked her why i was under investigation and she said that issue with me not making enough money to pay my bills 

i told her about the gift money and that i didn't think i qualified anymore and that i thought i could pay for my own food at this point she then pushed for the name of the gift recipient which i gave her 

am i in trouble i was completely honest and disclosed all income i did not think that gifts were income so i just reported that today then i received a phone call from the investigator who wants to come to my home i do not know what to do i have been completely honest i am a self employed person who bases my income on an annual basis as everything is different from month to month can you please advise on how i should proceed

so i have my own personal food stamps but they go onto my mothers card since she is living with me (we both live with a friend) and i was wondering if there is any way i could prove that she is taking the funds specifically for me and using them for herself

- record her refusing the let me use/take the card when needed

- print off card documents relating to financials

ps we live in north carolina

i used to have my own card until she moved in and they had to put my funds back on her card for some reason

if i can’t prove this i guess i will cancel my benefits because i won’t let her continue to let me starve and steal from me and the government"

"(california) do i have to report income change if i've found unpredictable freelance work if so how hi 

i've been on calfresh benefits for a while now and i've recently started doing background acting work it's totally unpredictable how much i'll make from this work in a given month; sometimes there are lots of gigs sometimes none at all and usually a booked gig isn't a sure thing until the day-of 

so far i haven't made enough from this work to cross the threshold for reporting income but now i've been booked for a longer-term gig which goes from mid-july to mid-august and should lift me over that threshold across both months (again however they're constantly telling me that these dates are tentative and could easily change)

does this sound like a situation where i need to report an income change if so how could i offer a monthly estimate for something so unpredictable

thanks"

"food research and action center (frac): federal nutrition programs update // frac federal nutrition programs update

october   
 
the news in brief: a senate floor vote on the fy  budget resolution is expected the week of october  

action needed: urge senators to vote no on the fy  budget resolution ask members of congress to oppose any structural changes or cuts to snap and other safety net programs whether through the budget resolution tax bill farm bill or other legislative measure

budget background: although the senate’s fy  budget resolution does not include “reconciliation” instructions that would require cutting federal programs it sets up a process for consideration of tax cuts tilted to the wealthy (increasing the deficit by $ trillion over  years) which will ultimately be paid for by cuts to safety net programs in the future it also paves the way for a conference committee to work out differences with a house-passed fy  budget resolution that directs the agriculture committee to cut program spending by at least $ billion over ten years and assumes $ billion in ten-year snap cuts for additional information and updates go to frac’s legislative action center and budget statement"

"do i qualify for food stamps in md based on the way my boyfriend and i split expenses i recently lost one of my sources of income due to coronavirus and i'm trying to apply for food stamps in maryland previously i was doing freelance work (which i can still do) and a part-time job as a physical therapy aide (where i'm still technically employed but my hours are cut to zero until the quarantine is over) i started looking into applying for food stamps but i'm not sure how to answer the questions about rent due to the way my boyfriend and i have chosen to share expenses 

basically he pays all our rent and i pay for all our groceries i also contribute time to buy groceries and cook we worked out this arrangement for a couple reasons i have a physical disability (although i haven't applied for ssdi) and can only work part-time so i make much less money than he does and we felt we should split our expenses in a way that reflects our incomes on the other hand he has a white-collar job and works long hours and doesn't have time for grocery shopping and cooking we also felt this would be simpler than having to venmo money back and forth all the time for every bill and grocery purchase 

therefore for the past  months or so i have no documented rent payments (although my name is on our lease) however i'm still contributing a significant portion of our shared expenses maybe -% (less now that my income has dropped)

does this automatically disqualify me from receiving food stamps i understand that they are not supposed to be used for food that he eats but the maximum amount i could get would be less than half of what we currently spend on groceries so basically the food stamps would only be going toward what i eat 

i was wondering if i could start paying him something for rent each month and he could pay me a similar amount for groceries but i'm not sure if that would be considered suspicious

thanks for any advice you can give me"

cal fresh cal grant question so i recently received an email as an incoming transfer student to the uc system from the calfresh website and it says i may be eligible for cal fresh food benefits because i received the cal grant i know that if i am eligible i can receive an ebt card that would basically pay for grocery’s each month but if i were to get a job off campus would that effect anything i do plan to get a job to help pay for expenses such as my rent for college and car but i’m not sure if i would need to report that to them and if it would affect my eligibility

"ny mother refused to accept food stamps leeches of my dad so i'm legally a child of my mother she's a bastard screams throws stuff doesn't work just vacuums and wash clothes oh and goes to the casino

she claims that food stamps are only for the disabled and she's a ""independent worker"" meaning my dad works overtime doing manual labor and pays rent bills and food 

meanwhile my dad's savings are being drained cause of this leech

he doesn't qualify for snap since he puts in  hour weeks at /hr

so i applied for food stamps (tx) in early september after i lost my job and i had my phone interview about  weeks which determined i was eligible as long as i send in proof of income from my new job and i was also eligible for emergency benefitsthe rep told me my emergency benefits would be available within  days and she told me to just continue to call the number on my card to check if the benefits are availablenothing i work monday-friday and can only call on my min lunch break of course i never get through to anyone because the hold times are usually  hours i’ve also locked myself out of the app so i can’t check there

"how to get snap with no address &amp; no phone (in iowa) about  / months ago i applied online for snap based on reading several articles that claimed that homeless people can receive this benefit

i'm homeless living in an old van and have no phone

whoever designed the online application (that's used in iowa) did not allow for this scenario :(
nor did it occur to them to provide an email address field

for my mailing address i provided ""general delivery"" in the closest town with both a post office &amp; grocery store
i explained my situation in the comments including my lack of a phone and i provided an email address stating that email is the ""best"" way to reach me
i go into town about once every  to  weeks for supplies/etc and only go to the po if i'm expecting a delivery (only food related packages ordered online)

apparently that extra info was missed or was not passed along to the case worker
they mailed a letter with a phone interview date however they did not email me
they mispelled both parts of my name

by the time i received that letter their deadline to schedule an interview had passed and there was a nd letter that said i'd been denied because i failed to schedule an interview (ie i received both letters at the same time)
the nd letter had the correct spelling of my name

the letters did include the email address of the case worker so after lots more research i emailed her  days ago explained my situation and asked her to check the original full application to confirm that i did provide contact info
i also explicitly stated that i viewed this as an understandable accident caused by serious design defects (outside their control) and limited staff time due to both the pandemic and the derecho (a massive wind storm which caused major damage &amp; disruption here this summer)

 days ago i received an email from the case worker asking for my ss# or case number
i sent the case number and asked a _bunch_ of followup questions
i haven't heard anything since

it's too cold to winter here (last week's lowest low inside the van was f) so i need to migrate south soon


**** perhaps some/one of you experts could answer my followup questions ****

additional questions/issues:

 does iowa do ""broad-based categorical eligibility""

 is an ira an ""excluded retirement account""
i have had zero income for more than  years i'm down to my last accessible pension savings which is an ira i withdrew at the very end of last year (at the time it was about k$)
i do have one other personal retirement account (about k$) however there is currently no way to access it so i did not include it in my application (i did plan to mention it in the followup - the online application had no separate section for retirement vs other assets)

 my van needs some major repairs (about -k$) which i can document would/could that be taken into consideration against my assets

 is it possible to pick up the ebt card at one of their offices
i'm anxious to get it as soon as possible since prices on dehydrated &amp; freeze dried foods are likely to inflate as the pandemic surges
i have no fridge so it's difficult getting adequate protein and fruits &amp; vegetables when limited to conventional products

 can they mail me the ebt card out of state
note that i am _not_ changing my residency i'll be back in april or sooner depending on the weather
given the situation ""on the road"" i literally do not know where i'll be this winter and expect to do a slow drift between multiple states (quarantining in my van on federal ""public lands"" only doing a supply run _after_  days quarantine and _never_ mixing/socializing)

 is there some way to accelerate this due to the inadvertent mistakes

 how complicated is it to get a ""free"" phone


note that the online info about # and # are in pdf files which i can not access :(
i did scan one of them and it contains moderately risky tags
** perhaps one of you professionals could ask that the info be extracted into a safe file format **

thanks in advance for any answers &amp; help

"do i qualify i live in the state of tn  i turn  in december food stamps would definitely help me out but i’m unsure if i qualify or not i live with my boyfriend at his moms house and i have for a year and a half now we don’t pay any house or utility bills the only bill i have is my car insurance they rarely ever make dinner at home i’d say we eat dinner here with them maybe  to  times a month we have a mini fridge and a microwave in our own room we keep frozen items in a freezer in the basement so no one uses them this is why i’m confused if i qualify the website says  and younger do not qualify because they are considered a household with their parents but they are not my parents
the “household” consist of:
me 
boyfriend  
his mom 
his step dad 
step dads son that only comes every other weekend 
step dads yr old that just moved in 

i’m very confused so any help would be appreciated 

edit- also i have two banking accounts i use one as a savings account (i have no card for it though) and the other is where my work direct deposits my check into and this is the account i spend out of the “savings account” has over k in it and my spending account has around  i try to keep most of my money in the “savings” but around k of the k is left over scholarship money that my school had to give me and i put it all into savings"
"can i (f unemployed) get a good card if i live in the household with someone who also has a food card this is in kansas if that matters 
the title says most of it i live with my father and younger sisters my father usually also has a food card but because he sold our previous home he was ineligible for the past year while he lived off the proceeds until he bought our new house in august buying the new house used up almost all of the remaining proceeds from the sale of the previous house we've been living off what little he had left and what little he's been making from working but it's very little after paying bills he used to have a good card but has not reapplied yet even though he has the paperwork filled out he works long hours in a city  hours from home so he will often stay over for a night or several days up in the city because my sisters are doing online school during quarantine this isn't such a big deal i can't work because i take care of them full time and nothing nearby is willing to work around the schedule of taking then to school and having to picky hem up and care for them after (when they would normally be going)  because he is often gone at work and we don't have the food card i sometimes have to scrape the bottom of the barrel so to speak to make sure my sisters are well taken care of before anyone starts witch hunting i make sure they never go without they have a proper meal even if it means i go hungry or i have to spend my meager savings to make sure

my father fully intends to get his food card back soon but never before has let me use it and it doesn't do much good for my sisters and i if he's  hours away for several days at a time and we don't have groceries here i want to see about getting my own card but i don't know if i would be eligible and i've heard that you are only allowed one card per household 
my father normally claims me as a dependent but of course this would not be the case if i were to get my own card

so is it possible for me to get my own card and would it even be worth doing anyway i think for my father's card he gets close to $ on his card but ofc for a single adult it would be vastly less if it is possible and it would take a big chunk out of his card but give me very little i wouldn't consider it worth it"

"uncooperative snap household member edit:  thank you all for all the help  while i don't actually know his finances i do know his issues with anxiety and i'm pretty sure he's just afraid the government is going to dig through all his info and find any reason to go after him for afaik he's never done anything that would warrant such a thing; i don't think he's the type to lie but he is the type to get overwhelmed

i'm going to show him the comment u/evilash made; it also just made me remember something similar happening to me where they pulled old info from a childhood c/o and little retirement account i drained during my time between the cracks that they ended up not doing anything with  so i'm hoping those two things will help assuage his fears

i'll be calling mdhhs on monday to see what they end up saying regardless; i suppose if it comes to it i'll have to sign up at the local pantry (they want your tax/income info/ssn/id # just like dhhs so they've got their own paperwork nightmare going on) or we'll end up at the food truck again whenever it comes lol

in mi

i’m in a relatively new relationship and moved in with my bf in march as things were shutting down  since we started sharing food i reported him as part of my household as i thought i was supposed to  he provided proof of odds and ends income he made his only source and we were approved

now snap sent us this re-applying packet and it’s talking about unemployment and some retirement account of his from   he told me he has nothing to show for “proof” for unemployment since he didn’t keep any documentation from  and had used up all the money to make ends meet  but  he also is unwilling to share anything about further finances

so now i don’t know what to do  not only is snap asking about things that don’t seem relevant on first glance my bf is being uncooperative  but we share food; i can’t really stop him from eating it either  seems like lying about is the only option he’s leaving me with which is obviously not an option (legally and imo)

whatshould i do  i apparently have until /

if more info is needed just ask  thank you"

"fl - authorized ebt user form i remember awhile back one of the snap experts on here mentioned something about an authorized user

i tried to look for the florida equivalent of the authorized ebt user form however the closest thing i have found is an authorized representative form that form only mentions speaking on behalf of the snap recipient and not adding an additional authorized user

the information i was able to find does not apply to my relative's situation it mentions group home assistance group alfs and similar situations

does florida have such a form i have provided some misc details below just in case i kept it vague due to identity reasons 

misc details:
i have a relative that's bedbound and recieves snap they sometimes have me or another trusted person go grocery shopping for them my relative is fully capable of managing their affairs it's just they had an injury that made them bedbound once their recieve the 'right' services/medical equipment they'd go to the store themselves however that's not the case and we're still in a pandemic so even if they had the services/medical equipment needed it would be hard for them to go outside with a mask on due underlying conditions and their age 

they have ordered from amazon but their ebt stopped working in stores plus half the stuff that arrived was expired or was close to expiration they used walmart delivery however the delivery drivers started 'stealing' their groceries and used the excuse ""i couldn't find the residence"" or they marked it delivered and drove off with it since then they send me with a detailed list to the store or another trusted person"
"can i accumulate  i get $ a month and just got the two $ payments my benefits ends in  months is it possible for me to save like $ every month and have around $ accumulated balance by the time my benefits are done

i am afraid they would decrease my monthly payments so either i stock up on non perishable foods or i accumulate my money i shop in bulk so i don’t spend the entire amount  is there certain threshold you have to spend every month

i believe my balance would last a year though before it is expired 

anyone got experience in this i live in florida also"
"food stamp recipients: this is a reminder that your temporarily increased benefits should not be used to pay back a previous snap overpayment claim the usda/fns that oversees the food stamp program [released guidance on may  ]( that clearly states that your increased emergency benefits should **not** be used to pay back an overpayment claim for non-emergency benefits 

&gt; can state agencies use ea to offset a snap overpayment claim 
&gt; response: no over-issuances of snap benefits cannot be collected from ea

that means if your state is taking part or all of your increased emergency benefits (this is apart from your 'normal' benefit allotment) they are in violation of federal guidance let us know if this is happening to you 

eg normally you would be approved for $ in snap but with the emergency increase you're receiving the maximum $ per month you had a previous overpayment claim against you and the state is taking over $ per month from you (even as much as the full $) 

this is wrong because $ was your normal allotment and now they are dipping into your emergency allotments by taking more than $/month"
"questions about florida snap benefits involving members of households thank you for this resource i've already learned some by going over posts

so when i was living in alabama i applied only as myself as a household when i was living with my then roommate i made my own money paid my own side of bills cooked my own food and subsequently got my own benefit

here in florida they seem to say that everyone you live with is counted as members of your household and they don't make distinctions like they did in alabama

my mom and me (i'm ) live together pay our own bills split rent cook our food etc i'm wondering how i just have me on ebt because she makes too much for both of us to apply (moreover she doesn't need ebt but i do)

can yall help me figure this out"

how do cases work i live in utah im curious as to how the process works like who decides if you are approved and how much benefits you receive do you have a specific caseworker or is it a variety of eligibility specialists and the supervisor is who reviews the information who decides what verifications are needed
food stamp investigation ive recently got on food stamps on april  and i live with my son and my boyfriend well when i first received benefits it was for only medicaid for my son and when i applied for food stamps i didn’t know it was needed to add my boyfriend onto my case we’re not married i recently left my job the beginning of may  because i’m a full time nursing student and i didn’t think about reporting that i no longer had a job because life is crazy and i forgot my review came up in august and so i updated all of my information and i ended up getting a call from workforce during the conversation i mentioned that my boyfriend is now the sole provider for my son and i so i can focus on school the workforce employee got so mad at me for not reporting that he’d been living with me all along and the next thing i know i have an investigator at my door asking me all of these questions i asked if i was in trouble or something because i was so taken back and have never had workforce physically come to my apartment before he said i’m not in trouble and that they sometimes do in person interviews he gave me his card and showed me that he is with workforce and told me i needed to email him all of my boyfriends paystubs and previous job information i’m so taken back by all of this and i had zero intention of being dishonest or whatever they’re insinuating what will happen i’ve been freaking out about the whole thing and everything i read on the internet says i could receive a huge fine or even jail time

"mistake during my initial application hello there

i have been having a great deal of anxiety about a mistake i made during my initial application for snap (wisconsin) when i first applied i was taking  credits over the summer at a university i was under the impression from google that anything under  credits was considered less than half time so that is what i filled out during my application and i submitted my transcript that showed three credits with it i applied at the end of june and got benefits for july to november

near the end of november i got my six month report form and filled it out after sending it in i got back a summary sheet and it said that i was enrolled less than half time however i enrolled full time in september of  i talked to a case worker the monday after i looked over my summary sheet and cleared up the confusion regarding my current enrollment status (september to now) we talked about how i wasn't aware i had to report changes in enrollment status and that i wouldn't have to worry about it being fraud as i wasn't aware i had to report it and corrected the mistake she was very reassuring that all i would have to worry about was paying back the benefits i got

however here is the part where i am getting very anxious and i would like some advice/input while i was submitting my enrollment verification for the fall semester(as part of my phone call with first case worker) i saw that my enrollment status for the summer term was actually half time i was not aware that the school considered half time status differently during the summer and moved the cutoff from  to  credits

i called back two days later and talked to a different case worker to explain this second mistake i had discovered i tried to make sure she understood that it was a misunderstanding on my part aka that i initially thought anything under  credits was less than half time enrollment and that i didn't know the school had a different enrollment cut off for summer semesters i tried to ask her if this was a mistake that i would have to worry about going to jail for but she said she wasn't sure and couldn't give me an exact answer she seemed new but now i am worried that they don't believe that what i did was an honest mistake should i be worried about them accusing me of fraud or will they process my mistake correctly as an honest mistake

i tried to do everything in my power to correct the mistakes when i found them out but now i am having constant anxiety that they will convict me of fraud and i lose my entire future

the total benefits i got was around $ with the extra covid benefits and i left about $ on my ebt card that i didn't use i understand i will have to pay it back but the fraud accusation is what scares me the most"

california ebt emergency allotment not received hello i am wondering if anyone else is having issue with their california ebt emergency allotment i believe we were supposed to get it today but i woke up and the benefits had not been added that has never happened before i always get the emergency allotment on the date they say it should be available  anyone else having this issue today anyone have any info or experience on this
"renewal of ebt in oregon i wondered has anyone recently had to renew snap benefits because i did my application online (end of october when it was due) and i submitted my needed documents they asked for as well i haven't received a letter or anything but should of had a deposit for snap on the th of november if it were approved (had nothing) so i thought maybe i should check the online website for my account i just checked it and next to my snap benefits it says denied but all my submitted documents say pending still it's confusing as heck 

does anyone have a similar experience and its just because they're behind in checking/looking at information and applications i tried looking for an email of some kind to send out an email for now since i can't call yet

i have even called my local office and left a voice mail and that was like the first week of november and they never called me 

it's now december and i'm still not hearing anything 😞 

thanks for any insight"

"[florida] food stamps nightmare unjust/unfair sanction and denial i have been fighting for two months to only be denied it started with a letter that was sent to my old address i had missed an interview for orientation at the workforce center first i am both homeless and disabled have been since my husband died during covid i received a good cause notice and couldn't get through on the phone for week and a half so i faxed a letter stating the good cause  days before it was due and submitted it online so they received it then i submitted a change request to update my address and employment status  a whole part time at  a week (before tax) all i have found in  month of submitting my resume and applications 

the site notified me i needed to recertify so i did that too my account changes to technical verification then i started receiving notices they wanted employment verification i spent weeks trying to get through on the phone and submitted the form my employer filled out i just started the job so at the time i had only one pay stub because i get paid bi-monthly and submitted that i got through to them  times in a month in a half all the while the reps telling me ""i see you submitted everything on time your account looks fine"" and ""you should be sanctioned i noted your homeless 

my address also reverted back to my old one during the month so i submitted another change

during last month i missed a phone call for the phone interview because i was working i called back every day for a week and she never returned my calls the rd and last time i got through the rep said she could complete my phone interview i affirmed the homeless situation and disabilities during the interview and asked it to be noted because of the pending sanction ""everything looks fine"" she says i would like to note that all my applications state that i am homeless as well the day before i get my deposit they send me a letter denied dec and jan my original application ended in dec now suddenly it ends in jan of course the deposit date has passed so i can forget getting anything this month

the reason (unbeleavble):  you are receiving the same type of assistance from another program no household members are eligible for this program you did not complete the work requirements listed below for the food assistance program - first non-compliance we did not receive proof of earned income necessary to determine eligibilty 

i called again took all day to get the call back that agent told me it because i didn't submit proof of income for october i said that is because i don't have proof it was a $ cash transfer for contract services i have no pay stubs or any way to prove it she tells me to write a letter and sign it and submit it online that my account needs to be triggered for reevaluation she tells me i have to call again and submit a request and of course can't get through

but what she is telling me doesn't coincide with the denial letter i feel like they are screwing people intentionally like they must be out of money i have never had these problems before 

what did i do wrong i don't honestly know what to do i have done everything asked of me i have been unfairly sanctioned and denied will the local legislation office help if i contacted them they got my unemployment fixed fast please does anyone know who i can contact or what i can do

also anyone else being unfairly sanctioned or denied"

"ebt tips i have a few tips for ebt food stamps users i just recently found out that the starbucks in my local safeway works with my ebt food benefits i’m not sure if this works at every safeway but give it a try if you feel embarrassed if you are declined just grab a bag of chips ask them to scan that to pay for it there so if your drink doesn’t get covered at least they’ll just think you were trying to use your benefits only for the bag of chips it’s worth a try 
i also use the ‘fetch’ rewards app to scan my receipts for my ebt purchases and any other purchases you can get rewards gift cards after getting up to a certain amount of points 
also if you’re trying to get valentines for your kids ‘usually’ any valentines with food in it (candy usually) is eligible for ebt 
if you can not shop at your store because you don’t have time or physically can’t or whatever your reason then just know with safeway pickup and walmart grocery pickup you can order through the app and use your ebt card i like this better because it will decipher what items are eligible for ebt and what ones are not 
i hope this helps some of you"

still never got the letter and yesterday (feb th ) i got a letter saying i owe them  dollars due to failing to report my new job as a means to recall the funds issued

so after i added him on we were denied and so today i reapplied and i only put myself and my baby and that baby father moved out i got a call not even mins later by this rude case worker not even listening or giving me a chance to explain and he said something about putting baby father on child support which i don’t want to do that and so he says he will send somebody out to investigate and hangs up the phone as i’m trying to explain again 

so now i’m freaking out and not sure what to do i know it was wrong to not put him on there but we are really struggling he makes “ok money” but that’s not good enough our bills are more than his checks a month

"gross income limit for households with elderly/disabled members hello i'm hoping some eligibility workers or policy specialists can help me better understand a pretty specific aspect of snap income eligibility as far as i know it is a federal standard that applies to every state that a household that includes an elderly or disabled household member only needs to meet the net income eligibility standard (not the gross income standard) but in many states ([tn]( [il]( for example) the income tables that are displayed on the snap pages of agency websites include a separate gross income standard for elderly or disabled households 

is there a reason why states display a gross income standard for those households even though it doesn't apply to them am i missing something

thank you in advance for sharing your knowledge"

approved for x amount and then denied for exceeding income limits i had to do a review for food stamps despite doing a quarterly review on my medical recently and sending them all of my income information a couple months ago i got a notice about how they needed verifications and then the next day got a notice about how my benefits were denied because i failed to send in verifications they had asked for literally the day before i had to call eligibility and was told to disregard the denial and all was fine i got a notice about a week ago about how i was approved for almost the same amount  as i had already been getting and now today got a notice saying i was denied because of exceeding income limits and that took effect as of yesterday though i didn’t get the notice until today my income has decreased from what they originally had on there and i found something about their income limits it looks like we might exceed income limits though a few months ago we didn’t i plan on calling legibility in the morning but was wondering did income limits change if so when the way they’ve handled my case the last two years has been screwy and i’ve had to call numerous times over mistakes they’ve made on mycase that caused me to almost lose benefits every time can i request a new caseworker i’m located in utah and have a family of  any help is appreciated thanks

"questions before snap interview tomorrow hi i'm reaching out because i'm a bundle of nerves

i'm  full time college student part time worker and make about $- a month (i live rented with a family member) and pay about $ for rent (starting last month barely turned  a while ago but decided it was time to pay my due) and $ for car insurance (awaiting drivers test)

i have about $ in an account but that's because i get college financial aid ($+$ every semester) and that's supposed to help cover some college expenses otherwise i don't make more than i spend and i'll only be in the deficit at least until i can get a license to drive to a better paying job in which i'll probably be able to live by myself hopefully 

i just need your guy's honest advice on if i'm even close to being eligible it feels like being very good at saving money for over a year has become a little of my downfall as i have enough money for food and rent/insurance for a few months yes but sooner than later i'll run out of the money and be screwed :'( 

i only ask because i want to be honest to the interviewer i don't want to state anything but the truth but i know that i'll probably not get any help in which i'm okay with it it'll just be harder on me for a few months until i can make it further in a better job 

also are there any other specific questions they'll ask about me in the interview like if i go to college where i work what i want to go to college for etc i don't know what else they'd want to know

i just need someone else's advice anything to calm my nerves"

"working for doordash/other courier gigs how to apply (edit - i live in south dakota)

orlando florida not receiving benefits on time (th of the month) is ebt down anyone else experiencing similar issues hello i typically receive my stamps on the th of every month but for some reason i have not got anything today i am kind of worried as i stretch out what i get for the entire month so that it lasts me until the th and so now i am without food until this issue is resolved customer support was unable to help and directed me to a phone number that cannot be called until monday is there any news about an outage or anything of the sort
"just approved for calfresh - i have some questions about using the ebt card i just got approved for calfresh (california version of snap) and am now waiting on my ebt card in the mail  i have a few questions they seem really dumb and obvious but i've been searching around the calfresh site and the wiki here and am finding no answers  forgive me if they're common questions maybe my search-engine skills are especially bad today

 i know i can only buy food and even then there are restrictions (no eaten-in-the-store type foods etc) and the person doing my interview said ""it just won't work if you try to buy toilet paper or something with it""  ok  what happens at the check-out of the grocery store if i accidentally have an item that isn't covered  does the whole payment get rejected and i have to use an alternative payment for everything  or does it notify the check-out person that the amount of the non-food item has to be paid for another way while putting the allowed items on the ebt  something else

  similar to the last question if i'm close to using up my monthly balance and accidentally get a few items that put me over that balance does it reject the whole thing or inform me and the checkout person that i have to pay for the rest with another method  something else

 i'm guessing the answer to this must be yes but does the check-out person at the grocery store see that i'm paying with calfresh/foodstamps  i kind of know some of the checkout people at the store i usually go to and i know it shouldn't matter but i'd rather they didn't know i am on foodstamps 

 i'm guessing the answer to this must be no but if i don't use a lot of my balance one month does any of that remaining amount ""roll over"" to the next month  i assume it entirely resets to the given balance each month i'd be very surprised if it were anything else but i'd like to know for sure 

thanks for any responses"

worried that my snap amount increased too much i live in north carolina i'm disabled and receive ssi in the amount of $ a month i live in my mom's house but i pay rent and pay for all my own groceries i've been receiving snap for about  years and the amount i got was always fairly low i guess because they didn't think i was paying enough rent when i first applied like ten years ago i was paying $ a month in rent of course my ssi payment was lower then too but i don't remember exactly how much it was anyways i remember i only qualified for something like $ a month in snap around  or  years ago my mom asked me to pay more rent which is fair because her electric bills went up so i started paying $ a month in rent when that happened my snap went up to something like $ or thereabouts back in october it shot up to $ a month i understand because they have a new way of figuring out how much money people need for food this year because of the pandemic and everything going up even more my mom asked for $ more a month in rent so now i'm paying $ a month in rent while making $ a month in ssi no other income paying for all my own groceries and my own phone bill just to add i've always reported these changes in rent when i do my redetermination every year this year i reported these changes and submitted my paperwork the caseworker did ask my mom to submit a written letter stating that my rent is $ a month which i don't recall them ever doing before so she submitted the letter based on that i expected my food stamps to go up by at most $ a month since i'm only paying $ more a month and everything else is the same but when i got my letter it said that i will now be receiving $ a month in snap i have been getting the pandemic increase every month so at first i thought they were just counting that as part of my snap benefits but that doesn't make any sense because the actual maximum payment for a household of one is $ not $ i'm worried that they made a mistake and gave me too much and i'll be in trouble if i accept it the only thing different on my paperwork this year is that my sister and her two kids have moved in to my mom's house temporarily but i put on the paperwork that they do not share food with me aren't applying for benefits etc so they shouldn't have been counted as part of my household or anything i just can't figure out why i'm getting that much more in snap from $ a month to $ when my rent only increased by $ does anybody know why it would increase that much or is this an error

"report in writing and haven't heard back from county+ conflicted info from interviewer (ca) hi all hope you guys can clarify something for me

so when i first applied for calfresh i was working a steady  hours a week and get my pay every two weeks however at the time i know that during summer my job would allow me to work up to  hours and i had plan to do so i brought this up during my interview and the person told me so long as i report it on the sar- form i will be fine

however i wasn't % sure this info is correct since most of the other docs i got from the county says i have to report within  days of change therefore when i started my increased work hour in june and got both of my pay stub in early july i mailed in a mid-period status report form with both of my june paystub attached showing that my income did went over the irt but as of right now i have heard nothing back from the county

therefore i just want some suggestion on what i should do i am currently trying to get a hold of my county via phone but every time i've called it's either busy or the line just went dead before the menu to select for language options should i continue trying to get a hold of the county or should i just wait for the sar- form and report the changes then per what my interviewer told me i really don't want to deal with fraud accusations or benefit overpaid accusations thanks

"be aware of scams impacting ebt cardholders hoping this can get pinned for visibility

please be aware of phishing and skimming schemes that have increased significantly in volume across the nation in recent months protect yourself and your card because snap funds are not replaceable in most states due to federal rules

***skimming*** devices placed on atms and points-of-sale (where you swipe your card including grocery and convenience stores) record your ebt card number and personal identification number (pin) that information is then used to create a copy of your card (called a *clone*) which is then used to withdraw cash funds or make snap purchases from your account 

**protect yourself from** ***skimming*** do a quick scan before using any machine take a look to make sure it hasn’t been tampered with  check the keypad or swiping device (called an *overlay*) to see if it's loose if the numbers are hard to press or if anything else looks suspicious **change the pin** **to your card** as often as you can and use a different pin each time

***phishing*** schemes begin with an email phone call or text message to cardholders telling them that their card has been 'blocked' or that there is some other problem with their card the messages provide a phone number or other way in which you are asked to provide your ebt card number pin or other personal information these messages and the phone numbers they ask you to call can look and sound **very similar to ones you receive from your snap agency but they are fake** systems designed to steal your information 

**protect yourself from** ***phishing*** do **not provide your** **pin to anyone ever** including your snap agency or caseworker your snap agency will not (and should not) ever ask your for your pin"
question about work requirements i currently get snap benefits in nyc i'm a freelance illustrator with a part-time job so my income tends to vary month-to-month my periodic report for july is due soon and i've only worked  hours at a paid job (of the  required) that said i earn approx $ per week [according to the snap website]( i don't actually need to work  hrs/mo but just earn x minimum wage per week which as of now is $ i know i'm answering my own question here in a sense but the letter i got for the periodic report makes no mention of it and i'm a little paranoid i might lose my benefits they've been a great help in pursuing my career

"sar run around literally something wrong every time i submit okay i'm not sure where else to turn this might be a long post but i'm begging for help here

got an email and link to submit our sar for california on the th cool i filled it out with all of our information and documents just like i did when signing up the first time the same day hear nothing so i assume it's fine  
got a letter in the mail on the th saying they didn't receive anything and our ebt benefits are being cut off on the st uh what the hell i double check where i uploaded it says it's been uploaded nothing out of the ordinary i give it until the th to see if anything will change in case they're backed up  


i call the office and try to explain my situation get rudely cut off and reassured very quickly that they did receive it okay then why did we get a letter saying we submit strange but i stay on the phone she says our screenshots and documents are incorrect and need to be updated to be better i told her i had no way of knowing this and she just sorta ignores me and gives me a monthly income report to fill out

i submit more screenshots directly from our bank statements and submit the monthly income report exactly how i was told front and back and signed i wait our refill date comes nothing

no i'm beyond confused because we once again didn't get a notification that we did anything wrong i call and they say that yet again we need better information because my boyfriend's screenshots don't have his name but they do they literally as described as ""payroll for \_\_\_\_\_"" on the deposit strange i was told yet again that i needed to sign the monthly income report because i did it wrong i told them i filled it out exactly how i was told on the phone only to be told i did it wrong again and that it needed to be updated

i submit the income report again and both of our full bank statements for june nothing

i call on the th and have my boyfriend speak to them because both workers were incredibly rude to me and ignored my questions they don't give him any information and demand to talk to me i explain our situation again and now they tell us we have to fill out the monthly income report again (no i'm not kidding) and get a statement from my boyfriend's old job that he's no longer working there during june he was working but they made us fill out the sar so many times that he eventually left that job we cannot get ahold of his work so we ask what to do we're told to go down to the dpss office because he can fill out an affidavit in front of a worker declaring he doesn't work there awesome

we go down to the office today and are ignored every time we ask a question and are told we need to get ahold of his work because he can't sign an affidavit himself if he's not self employed we tell him we were told twice we can do this in person and he just shrugged at us i was also told i need to fix some information on the sar report which i cannot do on the website anymore and that i need to fill out the monthly income report again he also told us to submit our bank statements i told him i have and he said he only sees the screenshots which isn't accurate because even i can see the bank statements on my account

the thing is that this person denied that there was a $ ea payment for those who got close to or max benefits  since july i would have been getting the maximum benefit but i was being reported as getting some $  because i was expected to only get the $ maximum after the ea payments she encouraged me to let them wait until the pandemic assistance payments were over before applying the correct benefit ammount  i didn't want to do this but ended up agreeing after being kind of bullied into it  now i find out that i should have been getting $ a month

i submitted a new appeal based on this information  what i want to know is has anyone been able to get retro payments on the ea money  how should i approach this  i have lost $ a month since last july because of this miscalculation but that $ was in federal pandemic aid  however the bottom line is that the department under issued my benefits and let the federal aid cover that amount"

hi are there any case workers from essex county on here ty nj
"mi snap (&amp; medicaid) case worker denying self-employment cost of goods sold expenses that weren't purchased recently accounting : when a business (or person operating as a sole proprietorship) purchases inventory for the purpose of resale it's not an expense  the business is exchanging one asset (ie cash) for another asset (inventory)  the cost of the inventory is only an expense once it is sold

until about  years ago i had self-employment income from reselling products online and submitted monthly michigan dhs- statements with copies of receipts for all expenses including for the actual inventory sold during that period

after about  years without self-employment income i started selling online again  i timely filed my notice of change of income and started submitting monthly dhs- statements before even hearing back from my caseworker  they just sent me a notice saying my ""old"" merchandise expenses can't be used as verification for current expenses

obviously i can't submit old non-inventory expenses but inventory is just different  maybe she doesn't understand the invoices provided are for the actual inventory i just sold but i'm pretty sure she's now thinking i can only deduct inventory expenses if it's purchased in the period the dhs- covers or at least is fairly recent  that's just not how it works  the same caseworker years ago accepted inventory receipts that were years old without a problem  :-(  i understand they're not trained accountants

i'm writing a letter back and i'm struggling to justify my position with a slam-dunk that will hopefully avoid yet another administrative appeal  michigan bem  is for self-employed income and pg  says ""countable income from self-employment equals the total proceeds minus allowable expenses of producing the income allowable expenses include all of the following: identifiable expenses of labor stock raw material seed fertilizer etc""  i can argue that especially because i sell many types of products and few quantities of each that i can easily identify the expense of my stock with an invoice even though it's years old  many of the invoices are for the only time i've purchased that specific item  but the bem doesn't go into further details for timing of expenses for cogs

bem  refers to  cfr (c)()  (well it refers to  cfr  in a typo because that doesn't exist)  this cfr refers to  cfr (b)() which has the language bem  copied pretty much word for word  but neither of these cfr's or any related ones spell out the timing of expenses for cogs  i searched michigan and federal caselaw and found no on-topic cases about these regulations

is there anything else i can include like authoritative sources to try to avoid having to go through an administrative appeal  i mean i can include source authoritative for accounting and taxation about the timing of deducting inventory but i'm hoping for something more on point

note bem  does allow a new business (or perhaps one with a substantial change in business income) to file an estimated schedule c even if not actually filed but that's listed as a medicaid verification source only -- not food stamps  i know i'll have to give an estimated schedule c for medicaid since the dhs- isn't usable for that but i'm just pointing out submitting an estimated schedule c doesn't fix my food stamp issue"

"applying for st time - questions about bank statements and income i recently applied for snap for the first time and i am supposed to submit documents including documentation of the balance in all three of my bank accounts (one checking and two savings) however rather than the current balance the letter soliciting the documentation says i need to show the balance for december   i applied december  so i’m not sure if it’s normal to have to show a balance for a date earlier than when i applied either way it seems like i will have to show bank statements for that month my concern is that they may view some of the transactions in the deposits and other additions section as income i do not have a job and have been living off of savings for several months though i am now starting to look for a job but my statement shows that i received payments from two people one is my roommate who sends me small amounts of money sometimes several times a month to pay me back for her half of certain things i buy for both of us to use (toilet paper laundry detergent etc) the other person is a friend i loaned money to in november and paid me back last month but i’m concerned that the caseworker will think these payments are income also complicating things the friend i leant money to gets snap and i’m wondering if they will see that i sent her the loan (which is on the same statement since it begins in late november) and count that as income for her and lower her benefits

basically my question is: will loans from friends and repayments from a friend or roommate for loans or things i purchased for them be counted as income will i likely be asked for statements from my friend and my roommate after the caseworker looks at my bank statement"

"calfresh overissuance part  los angeles california i previously posted about an overissuance and it can be found here: [

so i took the advice i was given from the previous post and i wrote a letter for my mom to give to her case worker when she went to the calfresh office to request the overissuance be deducted from her ebt card they first said she could not see her case worker then they read the letter and said she could see the case worker (she'd just have to wait) after an hour my mom received a phone call from her case worker (while my mom was in the waiting room()) saying the money could not be deducted but the benefits would be canceled 

my question is: what should we do now i'm thinking of sending a letter straight to the california department of social services because we've tried seven times now to reason with the people in that office but they keep my mom from seeing her case worker and they don't listen to our requests 

they also keep giving my mother bad advice someone at the window told her to spend all the overissued money and it wouldn't be a problem (even though my parent's income is above their irt)

does the above screenshot mean that if we wait  days the money will be taken from calfresh aka it'll be repaid

i'm sorry this is long any advice is appreciated thank you

edit on april  : first we received a letter a couple days back stating my mom’s account would be suspended/expunged due to inactivity on april  
i sent a letter to ca dss last night and my mom received a call in the morning the lady called to confirm everything that happened and told my mom she would open a case and that she would hear back from someone in  to  hours hours later my mom said she received a call from her case worker asking what the claim was about my mom told her about it and the case worker continued to insist that the overissued money could be spent and that she wouldn’t be able to deduct the overissued money and that was the end of that i’m not sure that the lady who called from ca dpss meant that the follow up call was to be from the case worker to resolve the whole thing or that my mom should expect a call from someone else at ca dss if that’s the end of the whole thing then i’m not going to keep insisting that they do something about the case because we keep hearing the same answers 
well if ever in the future we receive some letter about my parents owing that money back we at least have all the paperwork/proof that we attempted many times to resolve these issues but to no avail thank you to everyone who responded and gave me advice i really appreciate it

it looks like the federal government has finally gone all-in for online ebt card use which is amazing and a little scary changes like this don't come along every day and i suspect there will be fallout on it at some point  just as the change from actual paper to ebt was  years ago 

the list of currently participating states is [listed here by fns]( many thanks to u/dakotamidnight for the continual updates 😁

the [faq]( is still being updated for newer posters here *please* refer to it before posting your question - variations on ""where's my ebt card"" have been asked and answered often enough to warrant a specific mention  for instance 

any suggestions for additional topics in the faq should be sent to the mod team  seriously please send us mail we like it

i had a thought i wanted to put out there for community discussion  particularly from those members here with experience using snap (as opposed to program experts) it's sort of half-formed and i wanted to explore it organically

i'm not sure what i'm going to do i earn like $/month i tutor online about  hours/week (i would tutor more but i live with my sister and her daughters scream during the day so i have to tutor early in the morning and late at night when they're sleeping i need to sleep during the day while they're screaming) i'm not sure how i'm going to do these work hours i guess i have to do the work hours on my one day off i'm also concerned they're going to split these hours over several days unless the work site is within walking distance i can't do it this is my first time on food stamps i'm ashamed to be an american right now knowing how little i have and how desperate they are to kick me off food stamps

"psa - a sudden drop in benefit amounts may be due to pandemic supplemental amounts ending - please read note:  previous megathread on pandemic supplemental amounts [here](

---
**edit /** - per fns the authoritative record for what waivers states are asking for is located [here](  the link points to an excel file but i think it's probably safe given where it's hosted

---

question:  *i live in ____ state i just went though redetermination/renewal and now they're saying my amount is ____ which is way less than the _____ that i was getting before  why*

answer:  this is almost certainly due to the reversion to normal or as close to it as things are likely to get at this point  your new benefit amount is very likely the **actual calculated benefit amount** based on your income resources household size and countable expenses

why is this happening

in  the federal government as a part of the covid response massively expanded snap benefits for any state that had declared a state of emergency related to the pandemic which was pretty much every state  that initial burst of funding ended in march and then was extended for several more months  it is important to remember that this is a ***departure from program policy*** as an emergency measure **only** and should not be construed as a change in business

*what's changing and what's staying the same  i heard it's going to be this way until september*

the additional % benefit amount is staying the same through the end of september  other state waivers that allow up-to-max-benefits are likely ending at the end of june  at this time (mid-june) we have no information about what states may continue to receive that waiver for july because it is approved on a month-by-month basis  i would speculate that it will actually end june  because that's when the lion's share of the additional funding goes away and most states don't have the reserves to continue to pump money into the program

*will i receive any kind of notice about this*

no you probably won't  the reason is that the feds classify a change like this as a ""mass change"" which is specifically excluded from having a reduction notice  updates will probably be news releases and social media but they won't send you anything specifically telling you  if you've been surprised by this this is probably the reason - if it helps understand that a widespread notice by mail costs tens of thousands of dollars which is probably the main reason there isn't a notice that goes out  yes it sucks and we know it

pending since // i live in california because i am pregnant my job has cut my hours completely and i now have to rely on state funding to figure things out so i've been trying my best to reapply to calfresh for over a month but the first time i was denied because i made too much and the last time i applied i only had made about $ that month but that's when i was left on pending i received nothing about an interview nothing in the mail no phone calls nothing currently i have made nothing so i decided i would apply again in hopes that they would see the emergent need to have my food stamps reinstated but still nothing what should i do if it's important i do have a covered ca case and i am supposed to pay $ a month for rent which i would have assumed would have played a factor when i applied should i just kind of struggle it out until the baby comes in august and apply for calworks or is there something i could do to expedite the process
"obtuse &amp; inane overpayment collections ca so out of the blue i get an overpayment letter claiming i need to pay back $ i've moved counties and have had various problems as a result so i assume it has to do with that (note you're not supposed to have to re-apply when you change counties mid-certification period as i did your case should just be transferred over) the notice has documentation that is supposed to ""explain"" why the collection is happening but it makes  sense   every field is either  or left blank except for the field about the benefits i received for example all the income fields say i actually made $ ok well i didn't make $ but i did make under the income limit and if i had made $ as they claim then why the fuck would that mean that i was overpaid benefits and that i should be receiving $ in benefits that makes no sense also it says that there are  people in my household obviously that is not the case there is  person in my household me how can you even have a case/household with  people in it lol (here's the documents so you know what i mean:  and the number they provide for scheduling a hearing/requesting an appeal is not even in service  i'm disabled and was registered as such in my old county yet here i keep getting warnings about being able bodied and i've sent multiple emails and requests to call to my worker with no response i've included all my paperwork and proof that i'm disabled in those emails i don't know if because she still hasn't processed that i'm disabled i'm getting these but the warning letters i got still indicated i was at least eligible for benefits for the months they are now trying to collect on 

edit:

here's what i got from the county ombudsman after a lot of back and forth:

the supervisor of the worker assigned your case just contacted me the reason there are zeroes on the budget lines of the notice of action and the reason you have an overissuance of calfresh in c county is because according to the statewide system you are active calfresh in a county according to the supervisor a county should have discontinued your calfresh // but they did not calfresh in a county needs to be discontinued before you will be eligible for calfresh in c county

so then i say:

why did i get this (attached official notice of county transfer on like /) i reported my change when i moved using the official forms and i know that they were slow to transfer it over for some weird reason but i kept mentioning it to them every time i talked to them and they kept saying they would do it and also what am i supposed to do about this overpayment claim where is the overpayment if my case is still in a despite all evidence to the contrary why does that mean i was overpaid i haven't gotten additional food stamps to my knowledge at least that i can access nor do i have the money to pay the claim hence being on food stamps this still explains nothing about the overpayment collection claims what are the next steps i can take

and she says:

if the statewide meds system is correct as ehsd is assuming it to be you collected money on a county ebt card for december and january as of today you are listed as active calfresh in a county your next step is to contact a county worker if there was money put on your ebt card for that county then it is unspent and that is what you can use to pay back c county priority is to get your a county case closed or transferred and in so doing determine what money was paid to you for calfresh for december and january as you will need to pay back c county once a county case is officially closed/transferred you can reapply for calfresh in c you were denied cf in c because you have an open case in a county

and so then i say:

ok well it wasn't overpaid there and i've also done everything in my power to get my case transferred over here like i said i filled out the paper work and then talked to them on top of it many times about changing counties and have gotten acknowledgement that they will transfer my case obviously my medicaid case transferred over so i don't know why it's claiming this hasn't i've done my due diligence on this and i literally don't know what else i can do i'm not a calfresh employee i can't go into the system and fix whatever the problem seems to be i've already called and emailed them about this issue like i said and all i've gotten is acknowledgements they they will or have transfered my case like i said the paper work i got said it was transferred over here anyway i haven't seen any double payments to my card so what am i supposed to do about this threatening letter from c threatening collections if i was overpaid by a county (which there's no evidence of overpayment from any county but for the sake of clarity) then why would i have to pay back c county i do live in c so even if there was a double payment (which there's not) if anything a would collect not c and no one has given me any proof that there was actual over payment

so again what am i supposed to do about this collections letter can it be thrown out or do i have to appeal are you saying to just ignore it until we get the whole which county is handling my case thing sorted out at least

and also it's illegal to make me reapply for benefits just because i've moved counties the law is as long as there's no change in income or other qualifiers i should not have to do that sort of thing till my recertification period

----

any practical advice especially what to do about the collections which she hasn't addressed at all yet would be great 

despite her ""priority"" being that my old case is ""closed or transferred"" which as i say i've already done everything in my power to do my priority is  being able to eat and  not having money stolen/being harassed due to fraudulent collections so advice on that stuff would be great thanks"

"accidental fraud hello i had a few questions regarding food stamps fraud yesterday evening my family located in california (both parents +  dependents) received a letter regarding fraud investigation and now are worried about what it means since both parents are undocumented 

since early  my father who is head of household lost his + years old job and was unemployed for a while he eventually found another job at a cleaners a few months later and was laid off because of covid after a while when he was working he submitted all his paperwork along with my mom however due to health reasons (herniated disks that left him immobile for  months) he stopped working for the remaining of the year  + most of  and was unemployed for quite some time which caused him to stop reporting income from his side 

in their food stamps case the only income being reported is my mother’s i  years old  have graduated college  months ago and recently obtained two part time jobs as i start looking for a full time job while my father recently started working this month i also had a part time during - but because i wasn’t living at home but in college the social worker stated we didn’t need to report it my question is why would our case be investigated is it because there is only one income or because we didn’t report everything we needed to 

my sister who is also a college student and i have received financial aid back due to the pandemic but didn’t reported it because we didn’t know if we had to my family have also gotten money from pawning jewelry along with public assistance like covid grants/money opportunities but also didn’t reported it since we didn’t know if that’s something to report the letter states that they want pay stubs from - of when my father had worked for “uber” but he has never worked for them he has had a few work interviews for work in his field where he worked for a few days but didn’t get hired because of no social security should he have reported it even if it wasn’t a stable income

our food stamps amount have increased since the pandemic ($+) and we’re scared that this might mean we’ll lose our food stamps or even medical since both me and my father are diabetics and have chronic illnesses we are trying to gather the papers needed but because we don’t know what we did wrong we are anxious of what it means and whether we committed accidental fraud or not if we did commit accidental fraud would it affect my parents if they were ever to apply for citizenship"
question about changing my info i been divorced since may of  i do not receive any sort of financial help from my daughter’s father i have met someone else and we found out we were pregnant (i am now  weeks/  months) in sept of last year i updated my medicaid office and let them know i am divorced brought my copy of my declaration of divorce signed by a judge in person to the medicaid office medicaid is an entirely different issue and that’s been almost two weeks ago and they still haven’t updated my information will medicaid’s change of my information change everything else through snap they want my ex husband’s work information and the amount of money he makes but i no longer reside with him and i have sole custody of our daughter i am just not sure what else to do or where else to go from here i live in louisiana
"snap &amp; immigration hi all i am wondering if you can advise me 

background: i am a student and my spouse lives overseas (he is not a us citizen) we filed for his greencard which has been approved and he is finally able to move to the us for the last few months i have been receiving snap benefits as i qualify being a student with no income my spouse has been supporting me by paying my rent and living expenses (while also paying his own rent and living expenses) in the last few months i have accrued over $ in food stamps and have spent a total of $ of them the reason being was i was scared that they would  affect immigration and  i thought maybe i was mistakenly approved as i do have a spouse he technically was not in my household does not have a social security number and does not earn an income in the us 

my question: was i allowed to use that $ is that considered snap fraud as i do have a spouse or am i overthinking it i genuinely needed those benefits to pay for food (i spent about $ a month on groceries to try to keep my costs as low as possible)

i am calling to close my case on sunday when he moves to usa and my household income changes but i am wondering what i should say and if i have done anything wrong

"nyc heap help  

hi due to unemployment/ now reduction of work i qualified for food stamps and medicaid but apparently i got a $ heap benefit added to my ebt card showing as cash assistance on connectebt i dont use oil heat comes with rent 

what do i do with this/how do i use it everything i've googled says this goes directly to utility company (coned)  
only i had previously received one back in august for $ and didnt know what to do with it so jut left it on there then it disappeared a month ago now this shows up

i'm assuming this is a one-time payment even though it says it lasts for the month so if i'm supposed to do something with it like apply it to bills or take it as cash reimbursement i want to do it before it disappears this time again

i have not seen anything on my coned bills that shows a credit for this $ or the previous one i got in august for $"

"tx: inheritance from father; counted as resource i live in texas my father passed away in  i handled everything going through probate selling his house etc i handled making sure my older brother my niece brother's mother my younger sister and our mother all received what my father wanted done i even hired the lawyer to correct or adjust mistakes that had been made (from the mortgage company)

what 'profit' i acquired i dumped into certificate deposits; one to hopefully have a down payment to buy a house in a few years and then two smaller ones for some of my children (i have five children but wasn't able to do cds for all five do to the minimum amount required) 

i called  during that difficult time explaining my situation and asking how i needed to show my actual resources i also called again when i sold his house i was told both times that the inheritance would not be counted

however i did my family's renewal this month and the worker told me she wasn't sure i had been given accurate information perviously that the inheritance might very well be counted as a resource she said she would call me the next day to update me i have not heard back in several days my anxiety is through the roof waiting

"very upset and do not know how to file a complaint as most of us i have been working full time for  years with no assistance i fell on bad times recently and was not working for  months got food stamps the first  months no problem from there my state requires you to either get a part time job or show proof you cannot work

i spent one hour waiting in the food stamp office to get the approval form that my dr needed to sign showing i cannot work got it signed spent another hour waiting again to turn it in

turned it in and given more forms to come back for nd interview turned in everything on // they told me i was approved

i got a job at the very end of december because other expenses than food were just too much

&amp;#xb;

but i was still entitled to january's snap i reported my change(getting full time job) on january th within the legal time frame to report income changes) because you have  days after the start of the next month that the change took place

while i was reporting my change over the phone she said my whole case was thrown out because of my change and that the local office that i had spent  hours in had all the proper paperwork yet the supervisor of that office did not sign off on final approval yet so i would not get any snap at all on my disbursement day which is // (the th of every month) i could not have waited any longer to report my change yet i feel i should have waited since the local office was being very shady and not signing off on things that were complete

i am so embarrased and feel taken advanateg of i don't even earn that much now and was out of work for  months due to hospitalization which is why my doctor signed the form and i am even in process of filing ssi disabiltiy

they should have signed off on everything on // the day after christmas the day i turned in everything and was told verbally i would receive snap on //

when i called to report my change she told me to go in person to complain to the supervisor i don't think this is the best route

&amp;#xb;

tldr: turned in all the proper paperwork and was told in local office i was approved but when i called  to report my change they had never actually approved me just because supervisor did not give final sign off and so for the january disbursement i received nothing

edit: this has nothing to do with the shutdown as i began this process before the shutdown and even if it did they should be able to give me a date that i will receive something but instead my whole case was thrown out"

"georgia - i was sent a self employment work calendar but what do i do with it hi there state is georgia family of  husband is unemployed i get $/month from child support and about $- a month from my little etsy shop 

we just had our phone appointment today after applying for ebt and the case worker told us almost nothing she asked us to verify the people in the household and then asked for the name and number of our landlord we provided the information and she said “great that’s all i need have a good day” 

i assumed this meant we were good to go but i just checked my notices on the website and there’s a self employment work calendar she didn’t explain what to do with it or that we’d even get one do i fill it out for this month or do i fill them out every month from now on i don’t make much i sell stickers on etsy and get like - sales a week totaling about $- a week my husband is currently unemployed as well 

we used our tax return to pay  months of rent and bills so we are caught up until the end of may but we have no more than $ in our account i thought we’d be expedited because of that but she didn’t mention anything about it 

also what do i send in to prove i get child support i first applied for ebt in jan and they kept saying i was sending the wrong verification for cs so they closed my case (i was sending my bank statements from the debit card the child support office sent me) but they wouldn’t tell me what they wanted as proof instead i don’t have any kind of proof other than the payments i get each month no contract or court order in my hands (though it is court ordered i just don’t have the paper since it was  years ago) also the child support was enforced out of state (virginia) if that matters"

"does moving counties/households count toward overpayment hi folks i'm a student that recently graduated college back in may so i moved back to my home county (all in california) i was receiving calfresh benefits since i was living in campus apartments with no income when i moved back i was still receiving benefits but i did not use them and my sar- recertification was scheduled for this month i got a call today from my case worker who asked why my mail was being returned to the sender and that's when i notified them that i had moved back in may and that the old address was no longer valid (please note she did not ask for my current address) the connection was pretty bad but she said that she would close my case and that i could still use the balance the call ended there but i am currently worried because  i know i neglected to report the move and subsequent income change since my parents work (as opposed to my then roommates who also had calfresh) and  the balance is obviously quite large since i hadn't touched it since may so if i use it and the county somehow determines it was an over-issuance will i have to pay all of it back  would anyone recommend just leaving the balance alone in that case

after some new jobs and income changes i reapplied last month and finally after getting our proofs together we got approved about a week ago yay 

i automatically assumed that i would be getting a new card in the mail but during a conversation with my friend she mentioned that its a shame that i threw my card away because they would have just reloaded it 

it never even crossed my mind that i never reported disposing of my card to anyone so now i'm worried that my long-gone card has almost $ on it sitting in a landfill somewhere is this a thing or is it the norm to be sent a new card that is attached to the new case number

"overpayment help - calfresh hi everyone

i signed up for calfresh back in april i had $ in income but was receiving unemployment benefits when i signed up and talked to my caseworker i was told that my unemployment would not count towards my benefits because of this my monthly allotment was $

basically i’m wondering what my options are going forward my caseworker told me to call the county and the county told me to call my caseworker i wouldn’t have signed up for calfresh if i knew that my unemployment benefits would be counted towards my monthly income i filed an appeal but they said i will get a letter in  days with my court date

"calfresh letter of approval and denial - how to adjust current income hello friends 

i just received a notice of calfresh approval *and* denial in the same mailing because i also received a card separately hopefully i was approved 🥹

my questions are about the current income shown and how to adjust it the approval amount is for $/mo and it shows my income as $ and my irt as n/a when i applied i used old pay stubs because i was just laid off so the amount is much higher than my actual income since then my only income has been a small amount from edd so my monthly income is not reflected accurately 

- is it possible to update the income to reflect the actual amount that is well under the amount reported if so what’s the best way to do that does this require an appeal or can i call or submit an update somehow 
- does edd payment count as income
- why is my irt n/a 

apologies for all the questions but i have been digging into so many documents and websites am pretty confused any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated 

thank you kindly 🙏"

my parents (dad  mom ) will be closing their small business soon and not be making any income by the end of this month (also they live alone their children do not live with them)

what was confusing me was that on this website stating that you would need your bank balance of checkings and savings to be under $



but when i looked at the usda website  
and checked their pdf for nj it states that there is no limit on assets 

anyone else have any experience with this

"how are calfresh snap benefits calculated just got a letter saying my benefits are decreasing and the lady on the phone didn't help at all lol even if you are below the income limit is it possible to receive less than the maximum amount 

i get ssi and i was getting $  i just got a letter saying as of // my benefits are going to be lowered to $  

i just got off the phone with them because i was trying to get more information and the woman literally didn't know anything lol  at first she says ""oh everyone got that letter it's just about the emergency allottment ending""  then i was like well the letter says it is because of a change in my income and she says ""oh that's what everyone's letter says"" and then i said ""well it doesn't add up to $"" 

and finally she said oh well did your income change i said my ssi went up from like $ to $ due to changes to my housing and the cola  

then she said ""oh ok that's the reason""  

then i was like well can you look in the computer and tell me exactly what it was and she looked and was like ""there is no recent note in here so i don't know"" 

then i try to ask ""well what income amount makes you eligible for the full $"" and she said ""oh i don't know we just put the numbers in the system we don't give out that information""   

so i am left still wondering whether or not my income increasing was the actual reason for the decrease 

also in march ssi plans to reduce my ssi amount by $ a month and i asked her if calfresh will update my amount automatically and she said no they only do it every  months i'd have to report it or something she was very unclear 

i have looked into it and i think that they have a standard deduction  i also pay $ a month in rent can i get that deducted too 

this reduction to my foodstamps along with the removal of the emergency allotment will seriously affect me 

does anyone have any idea of the scale of income that they use like what is it 

like is it if you make $ or less you get the full $ calfresh 

but if you make $ you get $ calfresh

and if you make $ you get $ calfresh

like that does anyone know what the actual scale is the woman on the phone wouldn't tell me lol i'm so confused

thank you &lt;"

"pa snap - employer refusing to give termination letter not my situation but posting here for a friend who doesn’t have reddit 

he had food stamps two years ago and left the job he had when he was initially approved for them he didn’t update the county that he found a new employer and got cut off which was fine because he could afford to feed himself then with his new job at the time he didn’t think he would be approved anyway 

he is applying again and the county is still asking for the termination letter from when he left that first job two years ago 

his old job has a change of manager and when he checks in again for the letter he explains short-hand that the main reason he left was due to finding better pay over the time-limited brief phone call he had they were confused why he was only an employee for two weeks and why he would need this 

he later explains after getting an email to contact (&amp; able to provide more detail)  that that the reason why he was an employee for only two weeks was because he couldn’t secure training hours with the previous management forcing him to continue his job search which lead him to getting better pay than what the job was offering him 

new manager is now refusing to fill out paperwork and accusing him of wanting them to falsify records because he didn’t say that over the phone so they’re not going to do it

he just tells them they can verify with the previous managers what his hours were and why he left

the question is does it matter if they put he found better wages or if he couldn’t get training hours he left a full two years ago and he is employed full-time elsewhere he would not be receiving unemployment benefits the county just needs notice from the employer that he isn’t an employee of that company anymore the letter they need to sign is dated for  as well 

is there any work around for this if an employer is not cooperating what can he do

thanks"

"food stamps and documentation hello everyone 
i applied to get food stamps &amp; medi-cal when my ui benefits stopped coming in for about a month and a half after being kicked off of covered california when i reported it soon after i received the missing ui payments from the state which was a hefty amount i reported the change in the website they provided- mybenefitscalwin i got a new job too and submitted documentation of my paystubs constantly because i thought i'm making too much to keep receiving benefits

anyways i got a call from access telling me that i need to stop sending in documentation i informed them of all my changes but they just told me to wait until my renewal period i was also told i had no irt cap

it is my renewal period and i talked to other workers (because i am super paranoid of somehow accidentally committing ""fraud"") and they told me to send in the documents again i told them that i already sent it but i will again regardless

soooo now i got home from work and i have a letter denying calfresh (which i'm totes okay with because i hate dealing with paperwork and am again super paranoid) yesterday they told me to submit the paperwork but obviously i'm denied now i want to submit either way because i rather have documentation

buuutt due to having an influx of income before the renewal period will they want me to pay whatever i got back if they do is there any way i can argue against it because i did submitted paperwork prior i also got that phone call to tell me to stop sending in my paystubs i honestly wouldn't have minded paying it back but i do mind that i did report everything and yet i got that phone call and kept receiving benefits thanks"

"if i'm technically not on a lease and stay with a few different people with my child and i say i'm technically homeless is there potential for cps to try and intervene so i'm going through a hard rough patch and food stamps could really help me out 

i however have no home of my own and bounce around at various houses if i put down homeless for my food stamp app are they going to potentially think my child is neglected she eats like a horse and has a ton of toys at every house we stay at and her life is normal despite my struggles i have sacrificed very hard to make it that way

i will just flat out continue to struggle my ass of if this is gonna get me potentially investigated

i'm almost certain this is not the case because homeless on the street and not owning your own home are vastly different and i'm guessing they see both sides of this

"va: how does it work if i def need snap benefits right now but i'm staying with family who doesent help with any of my food or bills so me and my daughter are currently living at family's house and paying all our bills food and rent given to them for our stay


my issue is ik they get a little weird sometimes with stuff like this and i cannot get turned down for these when i need them more than any human around me actually needs them

since i'm paying my own rent and bills can i just leave the family members i live with off the application or how does it work they won't be eating my food and paying my bills and i won't be eating theirs or paying for their food

what do i do to ensure i get these i have less than $ in my account so i'm supposed to be eligible for emergency benefits and cannot fuck this up i need this badly

sorry if i come across as someone trying to be shady i'm def not i just don't know how this stuff works and my family is really weird politically(i got nothing against anyone's views or anything) and don't want their names on any ""food stamps"" so i don't know what to do since this formula for aid is kinda weird in my opinion atleast

thanks in advance everyone and may your struggles one day pass

edit: ig i could say i'm technically homeless i stay with a few other people when it's convenient well im waiting to land a better job how does that work if i'm not on any leases and stay around a couple places (but mainly family)  does that mean i'll have to give out everyones  info or no one's info so confused and so anxious over this i need it so bad and just keep getting the feeling i'm gonna get shot down even though i have a child and make less than i would at a fast food restaurant"

"snap pa issues with my case going on for  months hello all posting from a new account as my other one has some identifying info on it

tldr: caseworkers rejected my application several times due to mistakes on their part over the past  months 

it is a bit of a long explanation so i will try to make it simple

i live with a family member rent-free but am expected to pay for a percentage of utilities and all of my groceries and household item expenses i am currently a graduate student with one year left until i graduate i am really struggling financially with the rising cost of well everything due to my intensive classes/workload i can only work during my school breaks (winter and summer months) 

i originally applied for snap in early may but never got a phone call or piece of mail about the phone interview until  days prior to the due date of my phone interview i called the day before the last possible day indicated on the letter i received and the lovely woman at the office confirmed it would count as my interview and told me i just needed to supply one more pay stub as well as a letter from my family member stating i live rent-free but pay for groceries this was on a monday in mid-may and i submitted all of this requested info on friday morning of the same week later that afternoon on friday i got a letter stating i missed my phone interview and that my application was rejected i immediately called the help line and they informed me it was a mistake between their systems and to disregard the letter 

the following tuesday i got a letter stating i was rejected because my monthly income was too high they misread my pay stubs and read my ytd amount as my monthly income it says in several areas on the pay stub ytd and the amount they deemed as my monthly income i then called again to go over this issue the case worker i spoke with confirmed he could see it was a mistake and was re-submitting my application for review a week after this (we are now into june) i get a letter stating i was rejected for not providing documents by the due date the date of which was the same day i had my phone interview i call again and get an incredibly kind lady who read through every single occasion of contact between myself and the state department have had regarding this she apologizes and says she has no idea why i was denied this time (no notes apparently as to why) and that she was submitting a ticket to get it looked into and that i would hear back in  business days i get a call a week later saying that my application was back under review 

that was two weeks ago it has been almost  months to the day since i applied and have been getting increasingly strapped for cash and trying to stretch the groceries i have been able to get 

i call again today i get a woman who yells at me she tells me i never had my phone interview in may i told her i had it and gave her the date she says there is no record of it i tell her i have been back and forth for two months with this application she tells me it is still pending then she tells me my income is too high and cites the amount previously mentioned that was my ytd amount i inform her of this and she huffs and says that she can see that now then she tells me there is no such thing as review of an application and that i was supposed to submit a new application after i got rejected the first time i asked her why the other  times i have called regarding this no one informed me of this she told my my application was void and that i would have to go into the office or re-apply (but she had just told me  minutes ago that my application was pending) then she said she was submitting a ticket and i would hear back in  business days and then hung up on me i called the helpline again waiting in line for my call for  minutes for the same lady to pick up and then hang up on me again when i gave her my case number again 

has anyone had this experience or have any advice on how to navigate this i am seriously at a loss and am completely unsure on how to proceed i will try calling again in the morning to get someone else but i am just wondering why every other case worker was able to understand my issue and navigate my case but today i got someone who blamed me every second before she fully read the communication logs 

i really just need advice or expertise or any help in any form for guidance please and thank you in advance"

sorry if wrong sub m not rly sure where to post this i am just wondering from someone's personal opinion i guess is it worth it to get married legally  if i wanna keep snap among other  benefits  i have this irrational fear that if something happends to my boyfriend (rn) that i will be left with nothing  no independence  also if we have a kid down the line can they go on his benefits if we r not married legally i don't really care to get married legally if it is better for me however i am curious can we still do a wedding reception/cermomy/engagement without the legalties of it or is it not worth it f
why did i only get approved for $ and could i get more or less this year this time last year i applied for myself with my partner in the household at the time i was working a part time office job and making a little bit of money and he was seasonal farm worker i sent my pay stubs in and we got approved $ and i was just shocked because of how much we struggle every week but apparently still make too much for assistance i’ve been disabled but the past year it’s gotten worse so now i am unable to work and he is now full time i reapplied and they called me asking for his pay stubs even though he’s not the one applying since i have none now i am worried that he is making too much when we have to hunt and gather our own food just to eat

i plan on calling as it’s been  days from the original application but just curious if anyone knows about the average timeline right now

edit for clarity: i’m self employed had a slump in income the last few months which is why i applied the information they asked for was “exact dates” of my income i provided that information (it’s not consistent like weekly or bi weekly i get paid when i make sales some items that’s $ in a day sometimes it’s $ for the day sometimes that’s $ for a week so i submitted bank statements 
 and business statements showing exact dates income deposits)
i was also doing a delivery gig when i applied but since then have lost my car i wrote and signed a letter of explaining that i don’t make that income anymore because of no vehicle but i did provide the last pay statements)"

"disappointed and annoyed: just received a delinquent/collections letter edit: this is los angeles ca 


i'll try to sum this up as best as possible 

lost my job with pandemic applied and was approved for $/month a month later i received a letter stating because of the unemployment $ bonus i now only qualified for $ so they said for the first month i how have to pay back the difference 

it was a joke so i just stopped using it and figured they'd just use the balance i had to cover that 

a month later i receive a letter saying i still need to pay so i called and spoke to my case worker and she they can't do that and i have to fill out a form to indicate i'm asking for my balance to cover that ""back pay"" 

so i did this was last year in june  

today i received a letter saying now my case is delinquent/collections for $ 

i no longer have ebt because it said it would expire and i had to reapply so i didn't since $ wasn't enough and i'd rather leave that to someone else 

**does this mean that balance i left purposely now vanished**

so now my credit score is going to get messed up because of this ordeal 

it's saturday so i can't call my case worker but i'm already preparing myself for her to not even give me the time of day to help and remedy this"

these are almost certainly ending may  we've applied for another month  and whether we get it or not is up to the feds

california hello i'm really stressed about this situation i was told by my school that i qualify for calfresh because i receive cal-grant b i applied shortly after on the th last month using the app(great app by the way) submitted my info and my student info schedule award letter etc did my interview the next day and noticed on mybenifits-calwin i was approved great i really need it

the problem is over a week ago that info disappeared from mybenifits i called and was told i am ineligible as i'm not currently working and doing  units in a community college currently i told the representative that i get cal-grant she told me i could reapply and was shortly hung up on i did reapply i received a letter today saying i am ineligible(again) as i am a student they also sent me a warning for repayment of the ebt awarded to me(i received my card today with this letter so never used it)

i called again today and was told: ""i don't think cal-grant qualifies you for cal-fresh"" she escalated my application to her supervisor and couldn't tell me anything further even about repayment again hung up on shortly after

i'm not sure what to do now googling my situation has found others stating they were approved because of cal-grant a or b but not many the majority of what i found was just others stating you can't be a student which doesn't make sense to me if i put down that i'm not a student i'm suddenly eligible again because i'm not working

they will ask for a heating bill and say they are from liheap and that they ""want to check if your getting the right amount from liheap"" and proceed to ask for more personal info

college student with a question hello i'm a  year old college student in alabama and i wasn't really sure who to ask without potentially messing myself up i'm currently in my senior year and work a job that i plan to keep until i graduate in december although i'm at school year round and typically intern during the summer i'm kinda having a hard time making ends meet since i pay for all my stuff on my own (food gas car repairs cell phone bill etc) i was applying online but my problem comes from the fact that my household contains  people including me (my mother aunt and grandparents) however they don't really send me any money besides the occasional time i'm super broke and maybe need my phone bill paid and they can scratch up some change to help me seeing as how i mostly provide for myself will putting them down on the application mess up my chance to receive snap assistance

"snap reduced from $ a month to $ ( texas) i'll list my earning stats below but the short and simple is i got a better job that pays $/hr compared to $/hr but my rent has also increased by by $ each month i elected to start a new application as opposed to recertifying my old one something i regret now what i make/pay is:

* $ roughly earned each week from my job (after deductions)
* $ paid for rent each month
* $ paid for utilities (my utilities bill does not have a heating/cooling section it's just electricity + water + solid waste the actual amount is four times  since i share the apartment with  other people)
* $ paid for student loans
* plus extra for food

i've been fortunate enough to get extra hours at work sometimes so i make around $ a week but even then i've been struggling that said can anyone chime in with why i got hit with the sudden change"
"family of four i’ve got a question about benefits in wisconsin

my husband works a job based on commission so his hourly salary- - is less than minimum wage and his take-home pay varies pretty widely (we usually budget conservatively at $/week) but lately (the past  months at least) he’s been working a lot of hours (+ hour days six days a week) because a manager quit at his job and he’s filling in and is soon getting a promotion (which may actually end up being a pay cut because he’ll be salaried at -ish/hour but not get a commission)

we have two children two and under and i stay home with them  we reported for august and were denied benefits as of september st we do use wic but since my youngest turned one in september we also only get benefits for the kids  which severely impacts our grocery budget (so we get whole milk cheese some cereal beans and tortillas/bread a small amount of fruit/veggies as well as pediasure for my underweight two year old ) all this is to say that our grocery bill has gone up a lot the past few months

my husband typically makes anywhere from - every two weeks but since the shift in personnel he’s been making several hundred dollars more and we’re saving what we can from that surplus income &amp; hoping to pay off my student loans faster  so we’re not changing anything about our lifestyle in the hopes that once my husbands salary is set (but overtime and commission pay aren’t there anymore) we’ll be able to get by while still saving up for a (modest) house (we currently live in a manufactured home which keeps our living expenses at the bare minimum but we’ll soon have quite high heating bills)

our monthly income as of the denial was listed at /month and we have $ in monthly housing expenses not including utilities (which are every three months and also fall on this month unfortunately)

we’re not in dire need but it does feel a bit like the rug is pulled out from under us

my main question: is it worth re-applying or will i find that now we’re outside of the income limits especially once my husband is settled with his promotion  

if it is worth applying: how much can i expect in benefits do i wait until after my husbands promotion since right now his salary isn’t typical/accurate  

if it’s not worth applying: how does one fill the gaps between needing something like food share and being self-sufficient while continuing to budget and save and pay off debts  i know that in wi medicaid gives you a year to continue getting benefits once you’ve stopped meeting income requirements but we just went from $-ish in foodshare to nothing and since i am really good at stretching the grocery budget we were maybe paying only $ a month for groceries out of pocket beyond foodshare  so suddenly having $+ to make up for in our carefully planned budget (plus less wic benefits and a picky underweight toddler with health problems who needs to be eating healthy nutrient-dense food high in healthy fats) is tough especially when i’d really like to be putting that extra cash into paying off student loans so we can start saving

i didn’t actually get a chance to look at income limits for a family of four by the way so i’m sorry if i look stupid we’ve been making  $ 
or less every two weeks for a long time (- years) and have been making that work and just putting any extra toward student loans so i just instinctively save wherever i can and i hadn’t considered we might tap out the income limits this soon  it’s a great problem to have that things are looking up for us but i also don’t feel secure enough to begin spending more and there’s a very real possibility that a very small increase in income will mean more expenses for us and less left over at the end of the month which will not help us to get out of a paycheck-to-paycheck situation any time soon"

is this correct she said that if we pulled our kids out of school and had them in a daycare we could deduct the expenses but because it was at an actual school that it no longer counts we're in florida if that makes a difference this just seems so wrong we really need the help and i don't want to sacrifice their education to get it i've tried researching it online but i'm not coming up with anything that addresses school specifically please if you happen to know anything let me know"

"two ebt cards mom using ebt card when she's not on the case so i have an infant that has a lot of medical issues and i have three other children i have already had to travel far away for an extended period of time twice for my daughter; once was a two week stay in the icu of a children's hospital in a different state and the other time was in another city five hours away while she had a brain operation

whenever my youngest  has a medical need that requires travel my mother comes to stay with my children and watch them for me however we obviously only have one ebt card for the household (myself and my four children) so both times i've had to leave the ebt card with my children and figure out food for myself without the ebt card my children are all under  years old so they aren't able to go shopping on their own and use the card to pay for their food so my mom has had to do it could i get in trouble for my mom using the card if the food is being purchased for my children the children just aren't old enough to do it for themselves (and to clarify my mom is not connected to our case in any way)

also having two ebt cards would be very helpful for when this happens again so i can leave one card with my children and take the other for myself i called the office to ask about getting two cards and explained the circumstances but they didn't know if it was possible and weren't really willing to help me any further than that does anyone know if this is possible

what you're told to do is report it but what concerns me is that it's not consistent it's not like i got a raise at my job i'll likely make way less next month

if i report that i made more or close to the limit what happens when i make less the following month is it set in stone and i don't get any benefits what my options for someone in my shoes

these benefits are used to help other people in my home that don't qualify as well as me i made too much to access the benefits but i don't make enough to feed everyone and pay my bills it's a horrible feeling"

background: 
 household members are eligible 
 people lives in the house ( isn't eligible due to immigration reason)

my spouse whose getting food stamps also got pua ( and extra  a week) on april that was backdated from march  as soon as we received the letter that it was approved we immediately called dpss to report and told us to just upload the letter on the portal and asked if we have to pay back the released ebt funds since unemployment was backdated and they said no i do not have to 

i didn't hear anything from them no letter or calls i am still receiving ebt every month and i am worried that they might ask me to pay back all the ebt funds later on i read somewhere that they cannot get back the ebt funds once it's released so there's no point of not using it and just pay it back 

however i tried to do my job to report but i'm not so sure on how they compute in order to see how much i'm eligible for or if i am still even eligible for it

"[fl] food stamp interim contact letter so it's that time of year again i've been notified a couple of times by the dcf to submit a renewal for my snap benefits by december which i've completed as of monday as of yesterday i got another notice stating that i need to submit an interim contact letter detailing my expenses and if anything has changed for me financially

&amp;#xb;

everything has pretty much gone unchanged since my last application over a year ago the thing is i contacted the dcf to confirm if i still need to send in the interim contact letter even though i already filled out the financial portion of the renewal on the application

&amp;#xb;

knowing how social services treat snap or even medicaid recipients something tells me they're only giving me answers i want to hear resulting in me losing my benefits

&amp;#xb;

***should i just go ahead and take their word to disregard to notice or play it safe and send in the forms anyway***

from what i see it seems as though the worst-case scenario on one end is that i'll lose my food stamps while on the other sending in the forms it'll just create a larger workload for the case manager"

"nj snap eligibility with retail employment i lost my job in january due to a layoff and immediately moved forward to apply for benefits i'm still waiting on unemployment benefits but i just received my families first card in the mail a few days ago- right after i ran out of food

i also was just offered a job working retail which is making me very nervous for the first three weeks of my employment i'm going to be working a full  hour week (excluding lunch breaks so  paid hours) 

one of the conditions for snap benefits according to a mailing i received  is working at least  hours per week the job i have is a part-time retail job so after the training period my hours may be cut in half i have no guarantee of a  hour work week and my schedule isn't going to be stable enough to be able to commit to additional work 

i have to make a phone call on monday to call out of the mandatory nj workfirst appointment (even though i just did this last month) because i have work i also need to let them know that i have a new job- one where i won't have consistent/guaranteed hours or pay i know i need to provide  pay stubs but that won't be available for a month (payday is every other week and it will be - weeks until i get my first paycheck) 

i'm also concerned about having to repay these benefits either because i'll likely get a payout before i get the paychecks and/or they can process my new income also there's a chance i may get backdated unemployment checks for the month of january where i previously claimed i had no income "

"fed up with the welfare system so am i frustrated with the welfare system so am i
most people i know don’t know my family has been on food stamps since we went back to school it’s not something i’m proud of it’s certainly not something i talk about but i figured we were bettering ourselves so we would never have to be in this situation again and with the state of the economy at the time it seemed like the best opportunity
we’ve talked before about the system and how it’s set up to give people as little information as possible i’ve asked in the past how they calculate how much income figures into decisions they make and what kinds of things subtract from that i was immediately treated like i was trying to cheat the system the real question i should have been asking is why isn’t the system set up so that the best way to “play the game” is to progressively get yourself out of the system
summer this year i know i’ll be going into  credit hours this fall i know money is going to be tight but i also know i really need to graduate this semester so i picked up a job for the summer that claimed to offer flexibility around my class schedule it was also working with adults with disabilities which would be relevant to my field of study (psychology)
my paychecks were modest i was making just a dollar over minimum wage for some shifts minimum wage for others i was bringing home about $ a month tif pretty much had the bills covered with her paychecks this should allow us to get ahead right
wrong
so i’m making $ a month and about % comes out for taxes so i’m making $ a month right nope wrong again they cut our food stamps entirely we had been getting around $ a month in food stamps so now the difference in income from what i’m making now and what we were getting before is about $ nope wrong again we’re on pip a program through the utility companies where we pay % of our income for our bills so the difference is now reduced by another $ so i’m bringing in $ a month to do the job nope the job wants me to use my own car i didn’t have a car so i picked one up we had enough for a small down payment at a buy here pay here and i’m now looking at a $ a month car payment i wanted a car anyway so i don’t want to complain but it now means i’m effectively bringing $ a month into the house in additional income by working hours that keep me away from my family and keep me from improving my own house and there are still more expenses the reason i need a car is i’m expected to drive clients around when they need it aaa says the price to drive a car is  cents a mile for the average driver because i’m driving less than the average driver it’s actually a little more than that but we’ll go with that for now the job only pays  cents per mile reimbursement so i’m losing  cents a mile for every mile they have me drive last month my mileage reimbursement check was for $ this effectively means that i also gave them another $ to drive it is now costing my family $ a month for me to keep this job this doesn’t include meals because i’m not preparing meals with my family i have to eat out a lot i can ocassionally take in leftovers but we have to buy different things with that in mind i’m not sure what the difference is exactly but i would guess i’m spending an extra $ a month in food they also want me to be able to use my own computer no big deal i already had a computer but when the motherboard goes out like it just has i don’t have the option of waiting to find a good deal to replace it what might have been a $ fix when i found a friend with a board laying around is going to cost me $ along with the other handful of expenses that come with having a job buying clothes for it driving to work and back the fact that i’m required to use my personal cell phone for work it all just makes it very difficult to want to keep this job i really feel like the responsible decision would actually be to leave the job
tl’dr: it’s costing me $ a month to not be on welfare anymore

i was wondering if we submitted our latest tax return would that take care of this whole issue and prove our income we are a family of  and our tax return stated our income was less than $ a year my husband is a tipped restaurant worker so our paychecks can vary dramatically but out annual income is still low i am pretty sure we qualify and always have but all of the paperwork is so convoluted that we keep getting denied and i am very confused now about what more i can do to prove our income

will i be denied because of the money in my bank account or will i still be approved because i'm below the income limits i am in washington state if that helps

i'm also applying for disability and am on medicaid trying to keep track of what assets you can have for everything is so confusing"
"base vs overtime pay edit: for anyone who has the same issue our case worker asked us to take a wage verification form to hr and have them fill it out a big part of it was asking for proof of his wages from when he started that job to now thankfully that was only  years for us i assumed they averaged his income or took the base pay because hr explained that his overtime was mandatory since he has to finish cases no matter the end of his shift either way we were approved and we're waiting on the card now

---

sorry i'm new to all of this and i've applied once before for my family and was denied so answer given as to why i suspect it may have had something to do with the variability of my husband's paychecks 

he's a police officer and his base pay is for  hours every two weeks if he works the typical - like he did for a while when he had to have surgery on an injury we absolutely qualify this is his base pay which is about $ every two weeks 

now if he's out on the road and doing patrol he does a minimum of a  hour day but sometimes it can go upwards of - hour days if he gets caught up on a case of course he gets paid for that overtime and our monthly takeaway is larger his overtime checks can range anywhere from $-

when applying for benefits do we enter in his base pay or maybe an average of what overtime pay looks like there's really no knowing what his pay will look like because his overtime all depends on the demands of his job and what he's caught up in

"family of three in oregon - our maximum snap benefits suddenly doubled in june why my family has been receiving maximum snap benefits for our household size (three people) since april (our income vanished in march due to covid) we just made a grocery purchase and our snap balance is nearly twice our usual monthly benefit even though we only had about $ left by the end of may

our income and household situation haven't changed there was no communication between us and dhs since applying it looks like over $ was put in our account for june which is more than the stated maximum benefit

what likely happened and what should we do have maximum amounts been recently raised do they sometimes give two months' allotment at once or is this a mistake (we don't need this much for groceries)"
"calfresh cash hi i live in california and i have a few questions about my new ebt card any information will be appreciated i keep finding articles that say i can use my ebt card at atms even on official government sites 

i’ve tried various atm machines (surcharge free) and they were unable to authorize any cash withdrawals i was told during my interview i would have $ in my card 

it’s not a big deal if i don’t have cash i was just wondering if there was something wrong with my card additionally:

could i receive cash back from pos systems in stores 

why did one of my cal fresh letters talk about having the option of direct deposit for my personal bank account

"calfresh questions (ca) hi everyone i have a couple of calfresh questions in hopes to find some answers here i am a college student that moved back home after my classes transitioned to virtual learning my sister also a college student moved back home as well so it's been my mom my sister and i living in the same household for the past few months we currently don't have flowing income and have been relying on our savings and leftover financial aid to pay bills and necessities during shelter-in-place

i decided to try and apply to calfresh and see if we qualify for food stamps i applied on the th and got a call from our caseworker two days later he interviewed me on the spot and then told us what proof we needed to qualify proof of financial aid grants identification etc after submitting the documents he called me a few days later again to reconfirm one of the documents before he hung up he told me ""okay i'm going to check one more time to make sure everything's good if i find anything that i need i'll call you back""

that evening i checked my mail and received the paper application of calfresh a majority of the application has been filled (from the info i gave to him) and it also asked for the same proofs i submitted to him online our deadline to submit the proof is on the th

here are my questions: did my caseworker already submit the application for me and the paper application was just for my record to keep or was the interview only to help me answer these questions and it was sent to me so i fill out the other remaining blanks and resend all of the proof documents again

i tried calling my caseworker and left a voicemail but he hasn't gotten back to me and it's been a few days

sorry for the long post thank you in advance to anyone who could help me :)"

"ok wtf is snap doing i'm in nyc i got my ebt benefits on the st instead of the st and the th this month amount decreased slightly from what the two deposits usually were so i figured that was the whole amount for the month with the new increase minus the emergency benefits we'd been getting 

i checked my card just now and there was another unexpected deposit of $ almost the same amount i got on the first on top of the $ i was trying to save for the rest of the month 

so this month snap has paid me what i think is the new monthly benefit twice 

i don't know if it's legal for me to spend these ebt benefits or not did ebt or my state just decide to pay us twice a month now are we getting emergency benefits or a bonus i'm not aware of or is this a big goof on their part is this maybe january's benefits paid early because of the holiday 

i have no idea of what they are doing but i'm only one person and i never get anything like this amount paid to me in a single month this is   quite a bit above what i was getting even with the extra $ emergency benefit added on every month i'm talking a couple hundred more

anyone know what's going on i sure as heck don't"

but what i'm concerned is that my mom has a lot () of money saved up and i don't know if calfresh and the government will have issues with this i don't know the exact amount yet but it's somewhere between $-k saved up in her bank this doesn't count the official retirement funds like k just the amount in the bank in checking/savings

would it cause any issues is that even a lot of money for a lower working class american how much is normal anyway

"can having too much in savings/checking disqualify me from getting snap benefits i'm wondering solely because both me and my fiancé just got our tax refunds we each got $ because we never received any stimulus money (both of us were dependents in ) so right now that $ is sitting in our bank accounts waiting to be used on bills

additionally he received k in college savings when he graduated but its been dwindling down to where it is now about $ because we have to dip into it each month to pay bills/buy food

"what does the new food stamp rule about work requirements mean for the program hey everyone

you've likely heard that there's a new final rule regarding work requirements for the food stamp program that is slated to go into effect in april  i'm here to tell you what that means for the program

first here's [the usda's press release on the rule]( 

**what the rule changes**

some food stamp participants (able bodied adults without dependents) must work  hours/week to receive benefits states have been able to waive the work requirement in areas (eg regions counties) for reasons like high unemployment this helps people stay on the program during economic downturns during the recession every state but one waived work requirements in at least part of the state 

the new rule:

 only allows states to waive work requirements if unemployment is at least % *and* is % higher than the national average this is a higher standard than before

 no longer allows states to waive the work requirement based on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits states must rely on historical unemployment data which can take a little longer to acquire 

**who the rule affects**

anti-poverty groups estimate that about [ people will lose program benefits]( because of the new changes (some areas will no longer be eligible for the waiver and so the work requirements will kick that many people off the program) the usda estimates that this will save about $ billion per year (the program currently costs about $ billion annually) 

**what happens now**

as i mentioned the rule is slated to go into effect in april  what's likely however is that the usda will be sued by anti-poverty organizations which will delay rule implementation while the courts determine whether the rule is legal 

we recommend checking back in march  to see whether the rule will go into effect if it does and you're in an area with waived work requirements check with your state agency to determine whether you'll be affected by the change 

please let us know if you have any questions thank you"

"(washington dc) $ a month in benefits for a family of  that pays $ in rent and only brings in $ in total income is that accurate hi all i'm just wondering if that amount sounds accurate
we are a household of   small children and  married adults we only bring in about $ a month at the most we pay $ a month in rent so far we're only getting about $ a month in snap benefits but after paying rent childcare and bills we really don't have much money so $ a month sounds really small ive been working on this with the department of human services for months now and i am surprised that i both qualify for emergency assistance and yet for just a really small amount does that make sense i know my income might ""technically"" be considered high but with my family size rent and expenses i'm shocked my snap benefits are so low 

should i have my case re-reviewed and how i live in dc any advice would be greatly appreciated

ps according to [this website run by dc dhs]( i'm way below the maximum monthly income limit which is $ a month for a family of  and the maximum amount for a family of  is $ i'm just surprised that the amount i am receiving isn't even a fourth of the max allotment considering i'm nearly $ below the income limit again any advice would be appreciated enormously thanks and happy holidays"

investigation of fs trafficking i got a letter in the mail saying i was currently suspected of food stamp fraud dated back to / -/ now there was an instance where they gave me stamps that were backed up i applied and didn't get them for a month or two later i was in a room and there was a convenient market right by us that sold meats canned goods frozen entrees and more now they sold other stuff but they accepted ebt they have tracked every single transaction from that store as if they were all fraudulent now i must admit i spent almost $ in on fay separate times but we were walking so we had to make numerous trips and they were not cheap is there any way to fight this and prove my innocence if they have been shut down for  months now
how to tell if the amount you receive is right i have googled the income guidelines and all of that for tn and it looked like we would get the maximum benefit amount for a family of four ($) instead we got either what i assume is the minimum i misinterpreted the chart or i somehow messed up my application and no one caught it i put my children and my husband on there when i filed and my husband is our only income ( gross monthly income) we were allotted $/mo does this seem correct even with two minor dependents we rent our home own a + year old car and pay basic utilities i didn’t have hardly anything in my account and no cash on hand when i applied i’m really happy to have any assistance but if we qualify for more and it’s a clerical error i’d like to fix it
will our retirement account be looked at for food stamp decision of called dss a few times but have yet to hear back my husband has been unemployed for  months and we are at the last bit of savings after that we are broke i work from home but only make about $ a month he’s looking for work and has a few interviews coming up i want to apply for food stamps until he gets something he does have a retirement account valued at $ there are huge penalties if we withdraw early we would probably lose at least $ which makes me sick to my stomach is there any chance we would still qualify or will we be forced to go through our k first we live in south carolina

your household's gross income exceeds the maximum gross income limit for your household size

your household's total non-exempt resources exceed the maximum allowed for calfresh eligibility

i don't understand how that is possible  it says i can appeal should i do that or reapply in either case what do i need to do or provide to be able to show i make minimum wage for sf"

"""expenses are greater than income"" ""please provide information as to how are you paying your bills"" the day i got out of the hospital from covid- where i developed pneumonia and almost died from it i was reciving requests from snap well after a month that i had applied but that i needed to verify some things by the time i recovered at home to start looking up my bills and see if unemployment had payed me anything yet etc i saw their request in the mail so i missed their deadline for  days

now their original request said :

information/action required
expenses are greater than income 
please provide information as to how you 
are paying your bills 

acceptable verification/proof
you must provide verification of how you are meeting your expenses or proof your expenses are not paid

so i talked to a rep after that i sent them my missed mortgage house payments the mortgage is  of the missed payments but i wrote  in ""shelter costs"" since i was including hoa

that page says ""costs that lower your income"" (deductions) 
cost      deduction 

they sent me a new letter saying:

expenses are greater than income
please provide information as to how you are paying your bills provide verification of your mortgage payment 

what changed was the amount in their ""costs that lower your income""(deductions)

it says now shelter  deduction 

so it seems like they adjusted my shelter costs and now they want to see how the remaining  are paid
or they want to know how did i afford to pay stuff if my expenses were greater than income

i thought of sending them the statement where it shows unemployment was paying in december but then they stopped in december so i then applied to snap because i was unsure if i was going to get unemployment back


what should i do and not do i am having a very slow recovery from covid i don't have the energy to be dealing with all the extra stress i really need the help unemployment has paid whenever they want to then stop paying again 

i am not sure if what i posted make sense i am just hoping to get advice from people that was in the same situation and how they resolved it 


thank you please don't let covid get you it got me almost a year after i took care of myself"

today i had my second eligibility interview and was determined again to be ineligible they georgia department of family services did say that they received the memo not to include federal ui in determination but my state ui alone puts me over the limit

after talking to the agent and getting some ""tips"" from her i am thinking of reapplying in early april i told the agent my income was $ a week and she cross referenced the dol database to see i was eligible for the max unemployment benefit (which is maybe $ before taxes $ deposited into my bank account)

so for example if i sell a game for $ i am only allowed to deduct the average game price of $ from the sales price since i bought them in lots and bulk leaving me with a profit of $

well i've been selling games all year long and have made a profit of over $ so far

my partner however is an international phd student we have discussed marriage but we want to wait until the pandemic is better 

anyway here's my question: will me taking snap benefits affect my partner's ability to become a us citizen we live together in the same apartment do i just not report him as part of my household for the application if i do report him how can i do it in a way that makes it clear that i don't want him counted in the household as a beneficiary of the government benefits 

obviously it would be nice to get benefits for the both of us but he is not qualified as he is on a student visa and obviously it wouldn't be right of him to take the benefits

also on a side note does anybody here ever feel guilty about getting benefits i feel like maybe i shouldn't claim because when i was growing up my family was doing decently well but the pandemic is forcing my parent to retire and there are lots of complicated home issues that made me move out i don't want to rely on my family because the home environment isn't good for me and i am the youngest sibling i feel like such a strain on my mother i'm really struggling with this"

will they actually call my grandmother  she is in her ’s and is hard of hearing  i’m worried she won’t remember giving me the money or tell them a different amount   i sent the letter exactly as they asked i don’t see why they would need to call too"
any updates as to the status of grocery delivery and snap been trying to look online and not finding anything mostly interested in texas but other states approval would be encouraging at least
"snap benefits and the new unemployment amount i was temporarily laid off / when my job closed due to the covid  coronavirus i immediately applied for unemployment benefits not sure if i'm approved as of yet but i will claim my first weeks today and i guess i'll find out i do know i haven't been denied so far 

anyway i applied for food assistance on / and was approved for the full amount for a single person

with the new unemployment expansion of $ extra on top of the regular amount will that $ be count as unearned income like the rest and leave me at $ in snap benefits it's ok because the $ will help with food but i am just wondering if it's different due to pandemic

also once i'm back working for my employer will i be able to get them easily reinstated (low paying job) even if it's not for the full single household amount ($) or would i need to fully reapply again

thanks

eta: florida btw"

i know gross means total without deductions does this mean without even deducting self-employment expenses

for example on ebay last month my ""total sales"" were $ but i only made net $ which includes fees shipping and $ that i can prove i bought items for with receipts that i then sold over time

if it literally does mean gross and it appears i made over $ last month i'm screwed lol

the pre-hearing by the way is because they say i'm not disabled first of all then we have to figure all this out

edit: no one answered the number i was supposed to call at  and no one called me back no pre-hearing i guess this is going straight to a hearing i left a message at the general number but i doubt that will do anything the number i was supposed to call just rang  times then went busy

"social security income only but own my own home i thought it might be useful to post my own circumstances by way of encouraging other in similar circumstances to apply for snap benefits

i am seventy years of age  retired with social security income only  i live alone in my paid off home in seattle wa  

that happens to provide me with a $/month benefit  is that worth applying for

yes  for april and may my benefit goes up to about $  because the snap benefit is temporarily increasing to the maximum regardless of income because of the virus

the city of seattle owns it's own electric utility service  and discounts the cost of electric service for me by about % because i qualify for snap benefits  that's true for the city's water  sewer and garbage utility service as well

the city also has an extra charge for auto license tabs that i get discounted by $/year because of snap benefits

comcast provides me with internet service for $/month because of special rates for snap participants negotiated by the city of seattle 

a year ago in january i signed up for training as a cnc machinist with a local college because of the critical shortage of machinists driven by the boeing company and the booming economy  the $ cost per quarter for three quarters was paid by the state of washington because i qualified for snap benefits

i completed that training  but unfortunately the shutdown of  max production and now the virus has meant i haven't found the job i had anticipated  ----which would have got me off of snap benefits

there may be other discounts i'm not aware of because i have snap benefits

except i didn't send one in nor did i get anything in the mail saying i had to recertify too

") how to cancel calfresh and ) are benefits paid in advance or arrears i lost my job two weeks before the california lockdown and secured a new job but wasn't given any hours i applied for calfresh and received my benefits and now i'm being given hours from my new job so i need to cancel i mentioned all of this during my phone interview and she encouraged me to apply anyways but i can't remember what she told me to do when i finally got hours from work

so:

) how do i cancel the internet says i should call and leave a message but my last two messages received no response (unrelated) i want to make sure i don't owe anything back as a result of my benefits overlapping with my job when do benefits end when i start getting hours or when i get my first paycheck

) are benefits paid in advance or arrears if advance it means i have to not spend the food stamps money i have already received even though i won't receive a paycheck for + weeks and i kind of need the calfresh money if paid in arrears i think that means i can spend all of my benefits this month with no repercussion but i can't find any info on this"
does anyone know how people who receive snap/ca will get the stimulus check(or if they will at all) below the poverty line here and no bank account worried i'll be left behind if anyone knows anything about this it would mean a lot

there's some contact info at dhhs on where to report concerns  but the lead on it is being done by the fbi

"appeal my denial hello

i wanted to see if there is an appeal process for decisions on snap benefits i am a student trying to apply to receive benefits but i was denied because i have an on campus job that is my primary income for the record i am completely financially independent from my parents and i do not receive financial aid to cover my expenses for a student to qualify you have to work a minimum of  hours a week i am unemployed due to covid- as my university has closed if everything were normal i could only work up to  hours a week as that is the maximum amount of hours i can work because of my specific position i was denied because even though universities around the country have switched to online learning i am still qualified as a student so i therefore still need to work  hours a week the job market right now is basically shot to hell and back and my state is currently under a stay-at-home order my question is are they legally able to deny me due to these terms how can they keep their policy in place that students have to work  hours if nearly every college student in the entire country is affected in someway by this for reference i live in georgia"

i know i'm not the only one in the state that has had their card replaced in the past month but if it's going to keep being replaced without notice this is going to start causing problems 

the only thing i can find about auto-replacement is that if a card is entered manually too many times it will auto-replace but due to the pandemic i only order groceries online so i wouldn't think that would be the problem

does anyone know what's going on with this"
what should i do now i’m in ca and i have food stamps and medi-cal i reported a change in my household and income on / i’m almost certain with this change i no longer qualify for food stamps since i was almost at the limit with my previous income i submitted all necessary documents / i haven’t heard from my caseworker since i’ve called several times and left a message with my caseworker and her supervisor i received benefits for january and i will soon receive benefits for february i won’t use it but any suggestions to get ahold of someone to stop the food stamps i’m not due for a recertification till june
"card denied with funds available ca i would really appreciate some advice on this if anyone has experienced a similar situation i was recently approved for snap benefits and received a card and a pin separately in the mail my card has the balance i was told during my interview when i call the listed number to check 

however when i received my pin and went to use the card this morning it was denied i have searched for a way to active the card but everything indicates it should be ready to use if funds are present

when i entered the chip into the reader it immediately read chip malfunction three times until it allowed me to swipe and processed options debit or ebt showed up and i selected ebt then entered my correct pin and the reader came up with a screen reading re-enter pin due to incorrect info and this came up repeatedly ish times even though i was entering the correct pin after  times it just said denied i tried again to a similar outcome and then just used a different card as advised 

obviously this isn’t what i was expecting to happen on my shopping trip and i would really like to figure out what is problematic as i have $ for food but can’t access it when i could really use it especially as my application to interview was  months apart

i changed the pin over the phone today and was going to attempt using it again tomorrow before calling in on monday i store the card separately in my wallet but the first  days before the pin arrived it was stored next to my stimulus card could that have damaged it and that is why it’s not working thank you for any suggestions"
"change in rent have been unable to contact case worker about food stamps this is a follow-up from [this thread in december](

-

**the short version:** 
i went two months without being able to contact anyone about my reduced rent and received the old higher amount of food stamp benefits during those two months

-



**more details:** i no longer work and am on ssi  i moved into gov't subsidized housing in early december which represented an approximately % reduction in rent  i attempted many times for hours each day to contact county human services via phone  i've left numerous voice messages with my name number and a brief description of my problem on the voice mail of the person whose name is on my paperwork  i called other numbers and i managed to get a human a couple times but they were the wrong person and i was transferred to the same person's line and answering machine each time

-

i got a notice in the mail a week ago that i've been approved for food stamps through january of   starting in february they have gone down % in value but that was not unexpected given my rent reduction  

-

i have not used the amount on my snap card that i built up in dec &amp; jan because i was afraid i'd just have to pay it all back the dec &amp; jan amounts were twice what i'm now approved for  i'm concerned that i shouldn't have got the greater benefits in dec &amp; jan because i was paying reduced rent  

-

i hope that makes sense  i went two months without contacting anyone about my reduced rent and received the old higher amount of food stamp benefits(about % too much)  in truth i gave up after about a week and an half  i left at least one message a day and i never got a response  they have my renewal info with the new address and rent amount so they know i moved   i left many messages and got no response  i kinda think my case worker just doesn't care about dealing with this

-

i don't have a car and have only my sister to come take me to doctors appointments when she's off work - and there's a pandemic happening - so i didn't try to go to the office  i'm not sure anyone was or is physically there anyway

-

what would they do if they eventually decide they don't like me having/using those (probably inflated) food stamp benefits  would they just withhold benefits until the money they think they overpaid is satisfied

thanks for your time"
nc - husband screwed up taxes have to amend unless they notice the mistake will we lose our benefits or be charged with fraud while waiting for it to be amended turbotax somehow doubled his income and his dumb ass didn't check it before filing we have the w with the correct income and wrong income is obviously double that hoping irs will just catch it and tell him to do over but in case it's amended are the agencies going to get notified of his filed income and cut us off or claim fraud since amending takes very long
"my case was closed because they messed up should i apply again or is there another course of action i should take state of georgia tl;dr: my case was closed because i didn't fulfill the renewal/review requirements or whatever it was because i never received any communication about it so i didn't even have a clue that this was happening

i had foodstamps starting at the beginning of  a few days ago i discovered that my case had been closed i figured out how to get in to my account online and saw the notices there one was sent in november saying that i needed to do a renewal or something and the other was sent in december saying that my case would be closed because i didn't fulfill the renewal requirements 

but i never received anything in the mail i have not had any sort of communication that this was happening

so i called and was able to speak with someone today they said my case was closed because i didn't do the renewal thing i was like ""yeah i know that but the issue is that i didn't even know this was happening i never received the notices"" they said i would have to start over and apply for benefits again because my case was closed and there was nothing else to be done because it showed on their end that they had mailed the notices to me

they confirmed my mailing address; it was correct

they also said there was a notice mailed in october that puts it at a total of  vitally important pieces of mail that i never received but that they said they sent

i couldn't even see the notice from october online and on the very same day that i had just viewed the november and december notices i logged in a second time and the november one was gone all that was there was the december notice saying that my case was closed because i didn't take action and there's no way to even see the notices that i didn't take action on anymore 

this is so messed up

so i'm applying again i guess but is there anything else that can be done i feel like i've been scammed should i request a hearing

it reminds me of the beginning of hitchhiker's guide where his house is torn down because he didn't object to the decision made by the planning committee to tear it down because they didn't tell him that this was happening and they said that he should have known and he had the time to object because there was documentation about it hidden in some locked filing cabinet in some basement in some building somewhere"
"missed renewal deadline due to lack of notification (mistyped address) did i do correctly i'm in florida i missed (apparently) the re-certification deadline although unfortunately i did not receive notification of ***needing to recertify*** this is i'm not sure but i think at fault of the change of address i reported; the address was entered incorrectly (simply two numbers put in the wrong places) so therefore i did not get the letter indicating i needed to recertify  


as such my case was closed and i am without foodstamps this month- i just found out just to be clear   
i filled out the application again online at the access website and submitted it it has told me i'm eligible for--- i guess accelerated/urgent confirmation or something i can't recall the exact wording; i was told in the text of what i read that i needed to call to get this done  


 did i do this correctly or was there anything else i needed to do or should i have done something entirely different"

"(texas) was there a recent change in the age determination of abawds asking for a good family member who i trust and can sympathize with

for the last  years they qualified for ebt food stamps based in their age of +  it was lowered from age  to  back then because people + had practically no chance of getting hired within their trades or expertise and especially thsoe with other issues 

something *may* have changed recently (probably as a side effect of covid) and now they are without any explanation and age  suddenly required to comply with twc's e&amp;t program they were given  days to comply before their beneifits were suddenly cut off after  years

they did explain within the alloted time frame to twc (texas workforce commission)  the circumstances for which they could not comply within  days but their benefits were still cut off without proper review or notice 

i've verified enough of this with twc  using their own teirs rulebook regarding new procedures i'm fairly confident that twc did everything correctly just that txhhs did not review the case facts and let it default to the adverse action

the txhhs rulebook does now say that persons under age  *may* be required to  comply with e&amp;t programs (they actually make it sound the e&amp;t programs are more *stringent*  and strict at ages - which doesn't make sense)  but there were  previous age limits of  and  according to outdated google links as recent as  years ago but any new changes are totally undocumented that i can find 

it was also mishandled according to all current procedures at txhhs  no final notice of determination was ever generated - just benefits cut off  no chance to appeal 

since the cutoff age was + they never had to submit documents to prove a disability  and now that they apparently don't qualify based on age alone anymore they were never given a chance to submit documents qualifying them otherwise and there was never any final determination to appeal and extend benefits during the appeal  it all happened in  days

in the meantime we have spent  days on hold getting hung up on at least  times before we ever get to speak to anyone  we've used the automated system to be called back when ""our spot in line"" comes up only to called back by the system and then automatically put on hold again for + hours and then hung up on  it literally takes  button presses and anywhere from  to  minutes to get hung up on

now i understand why people go physically and mentally ballistic  if i weren't here now this person may have likely gone into the local office armed and dangerous  and i can certainly sympathize with that to some extent it's no wonder why we have so many sour bitter and violent people living in the streets that have totally given up on any government system designed to help them until after it's way too late and shit happens

what rule changes were made in texas in the last  months  and why weren't the possible beneficiaries/victims notified of anything that may affect them 

our main concern is getting their benefits reinstated during the ""appeal period"" which has apparently expired which will at least buy them time to scream louder and wider"

- or would it be better for the approved friend to list the student on her snap application (update her already processed application)

as for my rent cost $ for a studio is actually a great price where i live in nj and i only do that because i’m a student and living on campus would come out to roughly $/month so while a $/month studio apartment may be considered a luxury it’s actually cheaper than living in campus i couldn’t find anything near a train station (i don’t have a car) with roommates which is why i opted for a studio (my apartment is right by a train station)

"nyc snap - any place to complain / report inappropriate agent behavior just got off the phone with my interviewing agent - she reviewed my case file and asked me basic questions confirming what i had written down i'm a full-time graduate student who because of the covid expansion in benefits qualifies for full snap benefits without any work requirements (as long as covid is a national health emergency)

my agent kept repeating that i wouldn't qualify because i'm not working she recommended that i not apply and reapply next month (when i start work) because 'i don't think you qualify' there was a long robot speech before my call which stated that university students were exempt from work requirements which i kept trying to tell her and she ignored me and kept saying i wouldn't qualify (probably - times throughout the call) i finally got fed up and googled the literal congressional act that states all low-income university students because of covid qualify for nyc snap benefits without any work requirements (since december ) when i told her this she was surprised and said she had to ask her supervisor about it because she didn't know anything about this i went off on her and told her it was completely inappropriate to be telling applicants that they don't qualify over the phone when it's literally untrue

luckily i've done a bunch of research into this but i almost withdrew my application because of this agent i know the nyc human resources department is completely broken but does anyone know of any place to submit a complaint is it too much to ask for hr agents to have a basic knowledge of the snap eligibility requirements when these covid expansions have been out for  years i can only imagine that this agent has been spreading misinformation to tons of applicants anyway if there's no where to formally complain i'm glad i got to complain here :) good luck in this broken system everybody"

"p-ebt balance saying $ even tho we finally just got the card yesterday hi everyone - so long story short we live in philadelphia pa and we moved right when the pandemic first started because we live in the same neighborhood and we were doing virtual school at that point and because everything was going to hell in a hand basket i hadn't been too worried about updating my address with the kids school i had done a forwarding thing thru the post office and assumed that would be ok 

so come may/june/july when everyone was supposed to be getting their p-ebt cards i kept waiting and waiting and never got one by this point i had already updated our address with the school but apparently it was too late

over the summer i tried calling for help but had a lot of difficulty getting thru and was told that some people were still waiting into september so after about a month i just gave up back in november i filed an online claim with the state saying i never got my card  i never heard anything back at all

fast forward to yesterday / i check our mail and voila the card is there  so i activate it pin it and then when i call and check the balance it tells me $

why is it saying i have a $ balance it's telling me there was a deposit of $ on june th but that's the only transaction since i never received my card how the hell can i have a $ balance now anyone have any experience with this or any insights i am incredibly stressed their dad is out of work since nov th it's just like we finally get it and wth"

"tsap /snap food benefits renewal form - need help filling out for elderly father questions about renewal form
one of the questions asks about the people who are not applying for benefits but live in the home 
 *my father (yrs old) bounces around to  different homes throughout the month do i need to list everyone in those homes ( he uses my address as his mailing address and stays with me a third of the time)

also it asks about vehicles - 
 my dad doesn't own a vehicle (he doesn't own anything actually except for a suitcase w/clothes) so do i need to write down all of the vehicles in all of the homes or does the vehicle just pertain to him

in regards to money coming into the home he gets ssi/rsdi = $ a month
he pays a small amount of money with whoever he stays with ( separate homes) during the month do i need to write that down 

lastly i noticed on the description of his case there is a section that says costs that lower your income - shelter cost $     deduction $ 
 i have zero clue what that means

if anyone has any insight on how to fill this out i would be forever grateful i've called hhs/ and was in hold for hours i'm tempted to take him up there but he speaks little english and he's quite old and combative so it's a bit of a challenge taking him places 
  i don't want to mess this up and have to start the process over again
 also does it matter what the income is of the friends/family he stays with 
we help him shop prepare food separately and he has his own storage area in each house so that's not an issue i'm just trying to figure out if i'm doing this correctly

his job i haven’t heard back i log on a the case is still active i am very worried i don’t know what to do should i call my worker after she left i had to explain the situation to my child’s father and we decided to just have him move back in since he can afford to continue to fully support us and himself in his own living place this all was suppose to be temporary since i lost my income last year sep i did log on after and report him in the home my question is what happens after the investigator come

"acceptance for snap in michigan for only $ quick story applied for assistance in october but was denied knowing it was a mistake and took the route to re-apply instead of requesting a hearing so the nd time we were approved for $ a month after waiting another month but they made a mistake with our income (again) the approval showed how they calculated our income to give us the $ they still had unemployment still in the system from the pandemic back in  and did not take it out when we applied for assistance so they calculated our income ( per month) and the unemployment () i called today and they are leaving a note for our case worker to remove the unemployment so i am glad that will be getting fixed anyways so i question is:

will they fix the mistake and adjust the $ for the months of november and december and re-do it or will they fix the mistake and then in january we will get the correct amount in assistance i would assume they will adjust the $ from the previous months and even perhaps go back to the first application and go back to october but that's probably asking too  much i wish there was a way to actually speak to my case worker again bc i call and they told me they don't do that anymore anyway hopefully this gets fixed"

"i'm sorry i'm not trying to sound ungrateful i wish we all that receives food stamps get them in the first week in each month or at least let them receive half of them the first week of each month and the remaining on the regular date

food and everything has went high to the point people are going to end up starving because of the prices skyrocket and not enough benefits to survive 

fuck even the bills have even went skyrocketing   

pretty soon if this keeps up a lot of us are going to starve out or going out to do something to get arrested to be able to eat and survive

"alabama ebt notice about expiring funds on closed case i closed my food stamps case in alabama around mid-february of  after getting a job that made me ineligible for benefits i reported the income increase then a few months later in may of  i moved to mississippi and also reported the address change i did not need to apply to ms food stamps program and i stopped using my card since i figured the balance on there wasn't right for me to use i believe i had an emergency need for the funds and with a balance still i used probably less than $ of it around june sometime i knew i'd be able to pay back $ if it came down to them saying it wasn't mine to spend but i didn't use it again after that 

now it's been  months since i've used the card but i just received a letter (to my new mississippi address) from alabama food assistance offices letting me know i have benefits that they quote ""encourage me to use"" before they expire in  days i checked my balance to find $ on there i know i hadn't been using it all monthly even prior to the income increase since i lived alone from what i can tell no new funds have been issued all this time it's just prior balance 

my question is: am i safe to use these funds 

i don't want to assume but it was sent to my now out of state address i reported all the information to them in a timely manner as well as noting that my case is officially closed and has been for some time i just don't want to end up either having to pay the funds back or worse any information would be helpful and much appreciated"
"extra snap / food stamps so i just got approved for snap / food stamps for the first time and i’m kind of confused and think they might have given me way too much on accident possibly wondering what you all think and what you’d do 

i first got food stamps last month january and they said my amount was going to be $ i then saw like  weeks later they deposited another $ dollars i feel like that had to be a fluke but thought maybe it was a retroactive deposit and a one time thing for the year or something well this month february i got my regular $ deposit but then  weeks later i got another $ again don’t get me wrong my family of  could definitely use $ in groceries every month especially with how expensive everything is right now but i feel like it has to be an error lol

is anyone else getting extra benefits right now maybe because of the pandemic should i say something or just count my blessings lol

i tried to call them tonight when i realized it but the office was closed for the evening

anyways please let me know haha"

i don’t have income right now and rely on help here and there from people little bit of money i had etc the father of both my children has been paying for the water and power for us to live in his family home instead of child support

my question is: ) it asks me if anyone pays part or all of the bills should i put his name and if i do what does that mean: do they count that as income for me ) would it be better to have him send me money for child support instead of the bills diapers thing do they count child support as income 

i have more questions but i’ll start there like a lot of others i see i have to reapply basically now for march they didn’t send me anything but it says reapply online i t gives me so much anxiety because i desperately need the help more than ever i think most people do which is what’s so crazy about the timing of all this


to much info to follow just need to share maybe someone will relate

fast forward to this january he lost his job and we agreed he could stay here again to help with the kids while i went to work full time again i reported this on my case and added him to the household 

 now an investigator is asking to have signed statements from everyone about where he was staying etc to prove my eligibility 

what happens if i cannot get others to cooperate/sign the statement it is a complicated/toxic situation will this turn into a fraud charge will they just redetermine eligibility period and make me repay overpayments"

 is 'recertfiication form'  a  month thing 

 if it is why is it  a different month and time then the ' month change'  

 if nothing changed nothing else or new is needed for 'recertfiication form'  is that usually correct

"asked for bank statements need caseworkers opinion/ own judgement on situation pa assistance hi i have been on state insurance since  and have been getting food stamps since - i’m a waitress and have been throughout all of this i have never had a caseworker question me on things this renewal i have

i just got a call from the county assistance office (a fill in from my actual case worker) she questioned me as to why my paychecks only state that i make $ i told her that i’m a waitress and that’s what it shows that i make i don’t have another way to prove my income she then questioned me “how do you pay for you things” i said “it’s pretty much a struggle every month” she goes “sure it’s a struggle but it doesn’t show or tell me anything” and i said “well i’m not exactly sure what to tell you” and then she proceeds to ask me “does your child’s dad pay child support” and i said “no he doesn’t” and then she asks me “why doesn’t he pay child support “ i said “because i never took him to court for child support” she tells me that i need to provide my bank statements for the past  months and that if i have anyone helping me that i need to let her know

i am a little irritated because for the past  years i have never had any problems with anything of these situations i am honest and a little dumbfounded by all of this i’m actually struggling and need help i wouldn’t be on it if i wasn’t like i actually need help what makes me the most irritated is that there are people who have and continue to play the system and they have no problem helping them out but the ones who actually need help can not receive it or get knocked down…"

my question is i am going to obviously tell them that i am employed but seeing as how i make a amount low enough to not need reported should i still actually be able to receive them

like how do they determine who gets foodstamps or doesn't should i get the same amount as before since i still am not making much for now

i own the home and pay for it all  obviously this puts a strain on a lot of things when it comes to moving on  something i did not forsee happening   right now i want to sell her the house at a steep discount which i can do and which she would like as well but she can't see how she could afford to take it all on considering how little she makes herself

she is the type that would think she is above assistance but considering this i think that if she qualifies for substantial assistance that i could get her to look into it   i just need to be sure when i present it to her that i understand it and can make sure she doesn't just shrug it off    

yes i might be overstepping some boundaries here but i am also overcomitted financially in what she gets and it affects my stress levels which affects my time with my kids when i do get them  so if i can get her to accept this assistance and that can help make selling her the house a viable option to her i'm all for overstepping

"why do people turn down the $ in benefits please if you have a moment…i sincerely want to understand this line of thinking i promise you i am not being sarcastic but i just don’t understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it’s “not enough”  i genuinely want to know 

the current minimum snap benefit is $ this is what most seniors receive i hate that and i agree that is not enough obviously that’s not enough but if you are hungry why would you turn down $ the food pantry is not enough if you are having trouble affording food why turn down help

personally i don’t qualify for anything anymore but i think of it like if a grocery store were to give me a $ gift card every month i would love that even now when i can afford to pay on my own i would absolutely love a $ bonus 

obviously it’s not enough to feed myself or my family but it’s enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs bread and milk i see it as that’s $ of my own money that i don’t have to spend on groceries so that’s $ more every month that could go towards bills prescriptions or whatever 

i especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $ because it’s not enough (which i agree) but then struggle to afford their meds skip meals  pay late fees on their bills because they were $ short have $ withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc i know $ is not enough and i know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $ is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount 

please help explain why so many people especially seniors turn down this benefit i genuinely do not understand"

"(california) how does one go about closing a case and what happens after it sorry for the random question kinda new to this whole thing and i dont really have no one in my life to ask but when canceling your benefits is it really that simple to say ""i want to close my case"" to the person they connect you with on the phone i want to cancel my case and find it really surprising if it is as simple as that since they ask for so much verification do they ask for additional info on why and such or is it just like ""ok done"" might as well know beforehand i thought 

background info is that since covid's numbers are increasing i recently moved back into an environment more stable than where i was no longer needing calfresh technically and thought i could reapply when im back in school next year i dont eat much anyway do i mention this as a reason for closing a case or can i just simply say ""i want my case closed"" and be done with it with the worker on the phone (side note: i'm sure my recertification is this month as well i know a girl who didnt do it and her case closed does that mean the same would happen to me if i didn't do it)

a week or  after i got the letter about my ss i still hadn't received an ebt card so i tried the automated number again but no luck i found another number for ""lost and stolen"" cards and that actually connects you to a person they told me i had been approved for benefits but someone at the oakland office hadn't approved me for a card to actually use those benefits and the ""lost and stolen"" line couldn't help me if i hadn't been issued a card at this point i also found an email for alameda county but no one has responded to that either i continued calling the automated number

after maybe - calls total someone finally called me back last week she said they would send a card and she couldn't tell me why i wasn't able to reach anyone she didn't know the number was automated and didn't have any advice for if/when i needed to reach them again

now i finally have a card but they send the pin separate i got the card thursday and figured i'd give them the weekend to send me the pin before setting it up myself and no surprise no pin came i called a number on the back of the card to set it up and a recording told me the card had been cancelled i was planning to go grocery shopping tomorrow but now i'm back to square one i'm in the red after putting down a deposit on my new place and won't be able to afford my own groceries until next month i can ask friends and family in the meantime but it's incredibly frustrating to know i was approved for this money and have no way to access it

but they wanted me to verify income and stuff by / i didn’t get the letter until the sunday before the st i went to an office to turn it all in so it’d be faster and she told me they’d probably kick me out of the system because it was technically too late to turn everything in um…okay i turned it in on the last day but whatever i figured i’d try it anyways and if they didn’t accept it for it being too late i’d re-apply well they did choose to not accept my forms for employment verification because i was “too late” with my documents but when i log in to my account we all still have medicaid (my kids and husband until / and me until /) and it says our snap (which is what they said we were denied for) doesn’t end until february  so can i still expect my regular deposits while i work on sending in my new application should i even send in a new one if it seems like they didn’t even cancel our snap benefits i already have a benefit authorization posted on the lone star card for december i’m so confused with how they’re running things since covid started 🤦🏻‍♀️  they denied us for snap but i was up for a medicaid renewal so i’m very confused i’d really appreciate any insight anyone may have and can pm screenshots of what i’m talking about if needed thanks so much

i don’t wanna call and ask someone at  because i’m afraid to bring it to their attention so they can really cancel it 😫"
does this make sense family approved for $ a month - nj my family has received food stamps in the past but we stopped receiving them (i dont remember why i think my dad got a job) and now we need food stamps really bad bc neither of my parents work  the difference this time is that i have a job now (i didn't at the time we applied the first time years ago because i was a minor) which they included in the application we received a response but it said we were approved for around $ a month and my parents thought it could be a typo because last time we received $/month they also think this could actually be our allowance because now i have a job and snap expects me to be contributing but i cant bc i have to save for school does this make sense could we be actually getting $ a month like do they even hand out allowances that small has a typo ever happened lmao

"lost food stamps for may i live in texas with my parents and sibling and around late march we got a letter stating that we all would be getting the full amount up until november because of the pandemic however i just recently found out that only my parents are getting food stamps and my sibling and i aren't getting any because we did not participate in the workforce program that i only just heard about i just recently got a job where i can work from home but i am not sure if i will get paid in time to prove that i have a job

was this supposed to happen we were told that we wouldn't have to renew until november so i don't know if it means i won't get any food stamps until then or if i need to send proof to them somehow i'm just kind of confused as to why this happened and why we weren't notified about it"

i'm a really anxious person as it is and this has me so scared and unable to sleep i've never been in any kind of trouble and i am an honest person every time i applied for benefits me and my kids truly needed them the only reason i'm on them is so i can finish school and never need benefits again i've finally gotten out of this abusive relationship am getting close to being done with school but now i'm worried about going to jail or fines although i'm not really even sure what i'm under investigation over
i just want to know if i have anything to be worried about i've called to ask but no one is able to give me any information can i get in trouble for my ex coming in and out of my home or for being on his bank account how long does an investigation take how can i find out if there even is an investigation taking place

"[new jersey] eligibility questions hello  all i just have a few questions that i'm not quite sure how to answer in regards to this application

firstly i do have various health issues and have been unemployed most of my  life because of them however i have not been approved for any kind of  help like ssi and the like so for the question of ""are you disabled"" i  would still put yes correct or would i put no because i do not receive  any kind of help because of it it's a bit unclear

secondly i am currently unemployed but i see that they do ask about bank  accounts and things of the nature what money i do have saved from from  various things would be indeed in a bank but i've always been cautious  about sharing stuff like this especially online because of data leaks  and the like but if needed then i suppose i must does having money in  the bank automatically deny me from being eligible however"

we have received the food stamp debit card but still no -digit pin received yet

[ny]  schermerhorn office is open if you've been approved for a one-time payment for snap benefits you probably won't get a debit/ebt card mailed to you  you will need to go in-person to one of the offices to get issued the card which will have your benefits on it  the only office open right now for all five boroughs of new york city is at ** schermerhorn** **street** in brooklyn (that's not a typo - that's literally the name of the street)  i went on tuesday at around  am and the line was stretched around two corners of the block - be patient -  i waited in that line for about two hours - make sure you bring a state issued id:  drivers license passport green card va card etc and make sure you bring any snap documentation with you as well *just in case* \- basically any documents that were mailed to you with your case # on it  if everything is in order you should be outta there in about ten minutes - **with your card:**  you'll go to a case worker at one of the windows they do something on the system then they give you a slip to sign which you take to the **card issuing** window then once you have the card do not forget to go to the **pin issuing** window  they almost flaked on me and failed to mention this so i'm glad i double-checked  when you go to the pin issuing window they'll take your card and have you generate your pin that is unique to your card  once you do that you're good to go and you'll use the ebt card just like a debit card  if you want to see if you qualify for more payments like a month-to-month thing you gotta do it via the hra app or via a caseworker  the hra app is actually pretty handy and easy to use - you gotta upload a bunch of documents like bills proof of address id etc and then a caseworker will review  i never thought i'd have to go on food stamps but here i am and i am so relieved  don't let pride get to ya - we gotta do what we gotta do  life during wartime  holla

"using snap across state lines hi all my snap is in minnesota i have to travel out of state periodically and when i do i use my snap card in local grocery stores which i know i’m allowed to do but i’ve now gotten  letters questioning my residency and have had to go in and verify my address at the benefits office each time 

the staff there act like it’s not a big deal - i bring in mail with my address on it and it all works out but one of them mentioned offhandedly that if this happens too often i could lose my benefits i tried to ask her how often is too often but she just kind of shrugged 

does anyone have experience with this do you know “how often is too often” i have no choice but to travel out of state again next week and i’m nervous that using my card will cause problems 

thanks so much"

"[california] older neighbor did not report unemployment as income and is now very worried after learning that she could be investigated i have an older neighbor who does not know what reddit is she's been receiving calfresh since last fall but has also been receiving ui (including the extra $) since mid april after losing her part-time job she didn't know that ui counts as earned income and is taxable so she didn't report it she's been using her ebt card toward food as usual 

i told her that she was definitely overpaid for the past  months which might trigger an investigation she's planning to call her case worker tomorrow to sort things out 

here's my question - i know her recertification is due next month and she is actually starting a full-time job in november which will disqualify her anyway if she simply does not certify next month does her case just expire without raising any red-flag i know it might resurface down the line if she ever applies for calfresh again but almost think she shouldn't poke the sleeping bear especially because she didn't intentionally commit the fraud 

obviously i didn't suggest that to her because it's not really above the board but would like to know what you guys think we're pretty close as she doesn't have any children or family and i know she needed the money 

thank you very much"

so i notice i got food money for feb and now march so it's twice as much which is cool because i've lost lbs and can only go so far on ramen &amp; rice but i also noticed it says $ cash on the cal fresh login page what's up with that i never get cash only food money is that a mistake should i call back again"

i started seeing some posts here in my feed and didnt even know others paying rent where i live could be a potential issue until reading some posts here and the advice and the opinions dont really apply to my case i think  after i applied received a call from a worker who took my info on the phone i dont recall the specifics because i wasnt feeling well on top of being incredibly stressed when she called i remember discussing my adult son and she said that if he wanted benefits he would need to file his own case so do i have anything to worry about my son lives here we dont purchase prepare or eat together my husband has been living in another city with relatives since before covid started

they say i must report within  days going over the limit but they sure make it hard to do so  what happens if it takes me longer then  days  i have already been trying to call for the last three days but get the same nonsense and all the offices are closed for in person and my worker has not return called after my message i left her

also there is still two more weekly payments left for this month so once i report this am i expected to report again every payment after i go over the irt amount"

"inability to work as of  i became unable to work due to various health issues (and mental health issues) that became significantly worse over the years 

i moved to a new state and was accepted for snap they told me to show up for the work program class so i could be enrolled i went because i don't have a disability rating i've recently gotten an updated diagnosis from a doctor and i'm waiting to see another doctor on the th but i don't have a set doctor yet the woman there turned me away when asking about my job history stating she believed me to be unable to hold a job and if i had a doctor's note backing it up then i didn't need to be there

i'm at a loss i will go to the work program and show up for everything i have to but i have conditions both physical and mental that keep me from holding a job 
i did send in the first doctor's note on my ability to work and then they fired back that they'd like all these disability forms that i honestly just don't have (and my doctor from  years ago wouldn't have filled them out even then because he just doesn't do disability forms it's written on his office wall and hung up there)

so no i can't work yes my conditions are disabling as far as the ada considers a disability no i don't have an ""official"" disability determination yes i am pursuing both physical and mental health treatment for my multiple conditions i do want to apply for ssdi but i really just need to talk to my new doctor and find out if they can treat me to a point where i might eventually be employable again or if i'm kind of just a lost cause

i will show up to the work program appointments if they really truly want me to but i won't be able to meet the hours requirements due to my conditions i can try of course i just am intimately familiar with my health issues on any given day

does anyone have any light to shed on this situation
advice is very welcomed i am located in texas

thanks"

"case closed with no explanation (fl) i applied in late august for food stamps recently homeless and got approved and started receiving benefits in early september i received stamps for september october and november and i believe i might've received some for august ( despite applying and being approved at the end of the month) as well but i can't remember

 during my interview i was told i was exempt from the work requirement program due to my homelessness and health issues (chronic fatigue that makes it hard to even care for myself) alongside verbal confirmation of exemption i also never got a letter or any sort of notice telling me if i was still required to take part in the program to be eligible and when i would have to start if i did have to 


sometime around late september to early october i got a letter stating i needed to renew by november th or i would stop receiving foodstamps i then got a letter on october th stating i had to renew by or on november th instead i didn't end up sending in a renewal until nov th during office hours (i renewed online) however i noticed the renewal was dated the th but i didn't think that was a big deal as it said to renew by or on the th 

i checked my case online yesterday to see if anything changed and saw my case was closed and that the renewal section of my case profile was empty the top of the page said information about the case was updated as recently as nov th there were no notices as to why the case was closed what i needed to provide or do to continue receiving foodstamps or about my renewal it simply says the case is closed and to reapply 

i haven't gotten anything in the mail about my case since the letter i received on oct th there was nothing explaining why my case was closed i wasn't notified that it was closed  no updates anything no phone calls or anything either what did i do what should i do should i reapply or call and try to get my case reopened"

does anyone know why do they do this it’s like hanging a piece of candy in your face while on a treadmill the money has been loaded in but my balance is not updated and i cannot touch it it becomes available up to a week later 

i want to add—in nys at least i know your benefits are available on the date of the same number in which your benefits card 
ends for example: if your card number ends in  your benefits will be available on the th of each month however this is not always the case…

"[california]- very confused by mail sent for calfresh- help about a month ago got a notification we were approved for benefits then got a card in the mail saying wait for separate mail containing pin at some point between this time was asked to submit income verification submitted it and then yesterday get an envelope in the mail containing the following letters (and in this order) all of them are marked with a notice date of //

-notice of approval stating initial benefit amount as of / and then stating benefit amount // through // (benefit amount for that date range was about twice as much as initial benefit amount provided for /

-notice of action stating effective // benefits are terminated because gross income exceeds limit 

-reporting changes notification stating income reporting threshold (we are under this threshold currently) 

-notice of action- cal fresh approval stating account reactivated and that on // the county started access to the ebt account 

i guess what’s confusing for us is that it sounds like they approved canceled and then reinstated our benefits but sent all notices together in the same envelope will call case worker on monday but wondering if anyone else has experienced this/know what’s up

checked our balance and currently have the amount listed on // available

"nyc able-bodied adult without dependents (abawd) enforcement would like other's experiences on it i have only been receiving snap since january and while i wasn't planning to stay on it forever i was hoping to at least keep it for year until i sorted things out now i am worried about losing snap

some background: a few months ago i got out of an abusive relationship and i have a rare disease (in short it is cancer and an autoimmune disease) where i go for immunotherapy infusion treatment every  weeks i did not tell snap about this part because initially i was told since i have medicaid that means that i am not paying for my medical expenses so it won't 'add' to the case  

i got a letter about being an abawd the first letter came towards the end of january and when i called the snap office they said that my county had a waiver of exempt till the end of march; not to worry last friday i got another letter about this saying that it was being put into effect april st but no other information again i called was told that i just had to wait till i got a letter about an appointment (she didn't even say where the appointment was since the letter was not from my snap office) and when i asked if there was any kind of action i should take she pretty much said ""we are still figuring out things ourselves"" i looked online and haven't found anything for nyc dealing with the abawd mandate (other than the same old guidelines that states if you are exempt or not) so i am wondering if anyone can give me insight on some questions i have

) how do you log work or volunteer hours do you have to only volunteer at approved sites or get letters from them 

) if self-employed how do you prove work hours i am a freelance photographer and sometimes i work for regular people (not an agency or corporate business) 

) when looking up an approved hra work/training activity along with a program under the workforce innovation and opportunity act or trade act it seemed like it was mostly educational things such as going to a trade type school for mostly low-wage hospitality/customer service type classes (such as a barber shop school) or going back to school which i do not have money to do now do they expect me to go back to school

) job searching has been mentioned here how do you even log in hours of job searching/proving it 

) will any of this possibly include helping someone apply for a city/state/federal job it's a long shot i know but the letter mentioned job readiness and job searching

i really don't want to lose snap right now and the problem with job searching is because of my illness but also i need a job that offers good medical (i can't go without it) and does not just see me as simply a liability can anyone give me any insight"

"government assistance for non-food items hi i'm a doctor that works in a low income community in tn and am trying to learn some of the particulars about government assistance i often get the feeling that my patients might politely smile and nod when i ask them to get some basic thing at the store for their treatment (ie ""soak your foot in epson salt"" ""try some mylanta"" etc)- even if they know they can't afford it  i realize that there might be variations in the benefits people receive but in general: 

 can food stamps buy toiletries (toothpaste tampons etc)
 if not how do most people on public assistance afford these
 can food stamps buy otc meds such as vitamins
 in general is it cheaper to buy things like vitamins or tylenol over the counter than it is to get them with a prescription on medicaid (not sure what the average medicaid co-pay is)

"many questions mostly regarding upcoming work requirements with trump's bill this is for ca asking on behalf of my brother apologies if this info is out there and i simply couldn't find it  

&amp;nbsp;  

- what happens if over the last few months he did not meet the hour requirements but will start to immediately will he get screwed over for a month or two  

- when is the /hour a week thing checked is it  every single week  a month an exact ~ a month  

- what happens if he does gig work as an independent contractor and can always add unpaid hours by declining offers are clocked downtime hours counted or actual worked hours  

- the point of the change is to move towards self-sufficiency he very much is and is in training and en route to a career but he's self-taught and can't prove trained hours does those hours count  

- he's in a weird place where he's both a dependent and not (factually not on paper) he recently started filing taxes as a dependent (under me) but with the food stamp place he has to be his own seperate household or he won't get funds (he pays for his own food) this makes perfect sense to me but does it to the government or does he have to be the same for both

texas: the ytb website showed i received a deposit but it's not there yesterday when i was looking at the your texas benefits website of my recent transactions it showed that i received a deposit on november th i tried to grab a few things but the card declined when i called the card it didn't have the deposit in the balance is it possibly still pending or perhaps a mistake on the website
our snap is ending when will we receive our last payment (pennsylvania) i just reported my increase in income this week and spoke with a caseworker today and verified that our benefits will end november th  i asked if we would be receiving another payment for december or if we are cut off immediately  i assumed immediately but he wasn't sure  he said it depended on the timing   should i assume we will not receive benefits in december  thank you for your help
mandatory work requirements for foodstamps coming soon i was told over the phone by ebt people (in oregon) that soon (within the next year) it will be required to have a job to stay on ebt the minimum requirement is  hours of employment per week/ hours per month does anyone else know about this what is going on
nyc hra agency telephone numbers not sure if this is the right place to post i was denied from (nyc hra) snap but they calculated my monthly income wrong and are claiming i make almost $k more than what i actually do so i really should in fact qualify they said i could call the general telephone or the agency conference but both numbers don't work what are my next steps can i walk into a benefits access center and talk to someone
does anyone's else's snap balance go up randomly i've noticed that my ebt will go up between - dollars i'm not sure why and was wondering if anybody knows why or have had he same thing happen

i need help please hello i am in los angeles county and i had a sar- report that was due by sept  for the month of august  which i submitted online on // i received a letter from them on // saying that my sar- report was received incomplete giving me until the end of october to send them what they needed or else risking my benefits being stopped now mind you the information that they are requesting that they say is missing i did submit that information along with my sar- report on the required date and did that online and i have the confirmation number as proof but i went ahead and complied with the request of what they needed to complete my incomplete sar- report and i resent that information to them online again getting a confirmation number as proof and that did this on // one day after i received in the mail the incomplete sar- report letter but come november  my benefits were not loaded to my ebt card so i called them on // and asked them to transfer me to the department that handles the reprocessing of sar- reports which they did and the ew whom i spoke looked up my case and she confirmed that i had filled out and sent in my documents in a timely fashion and it was an error on their end and not an error on my part so she reprocessed my report while i stayed on the line with her which took about min she then told me she was going to expedite my case to her supervisor for final sign off and i should receive my benefits within a - day window we are now almost in dec and i still have not received my benefits i’ve called several times this month and i keep getting the same answer from the ew that i see you have called several times and what i’ve done for you is i have put a note on your case to my supervisor saying urgent that even though you filled out your report in a timely fashion your benefits were stopped when they should not have and then i ask when i will see my benefits reinstated they can’t say but that it has been transferred to a supervisor for approval and that my benefits will be retroactive but this is what they have been saying every time i’ve called this month today i called and again they said it’s waiting for a supervisor approval i asked to speak or be transferred to a supervisor but was told they could not do that and that i just needed to wait is there anything else i can do that i’m not doing aside from filing an appeal which when i asked the ew about that she said that if i file to have a hearing on my case that it would delay my benefits even longer from being reinstated is there anything else i can do i would greatly appreciate any help with matter thank you

"appeal went through - no back benefits hi all -- 

my state is: ca

first thanks for all the support you experts provide for people here i appreciate the good will in helping people with matters that deeply affect their daily lives 

i recently (re)qualified for calfresh but the office i went through made a mistake and counted some of my income twice (according to the appeals specialist) they then re-evaluated and i ended up qualifying for more benefits problem is they only back-paid me for september when i had originally applied in july and qualified for august (and received the wrong amount due to their error) 

should i go about trying to retrieve my benefits for august and if so how

 it asks me about my savings but i thought that food stamps did not consider your assets in ny i am disabled so i thought that protected me as well i have more in savings than before due to the stimulus 

 i had a dormant etsy shop when i applied for food stamps (not even online so i did not mention it) and i put some new items on it during the pandemic i am disabled and so i’m still very under the threshold income wise (i think i would face issues with ssdi before food stamps) but the income varies dramatically month to month how can i report something like this their form really only has room for reporting wages at an hourly job if i don’t report it (i have so many things on my to-do list just to keep myself alive that all the stuff never gets done not trying to evade intentionally) but i get audited and i was still under the threshold the whole time would they kick me off/fine me/ban me from food stamps

obviously earning k in a month goes over the monthly threshold for ebt eligibility problem is i'm afraid of losing the ebt in the long run just because i made a lot of money one time since this is a freelance job for a major company i can't claim this as a gift since their will most definitely have a contract for this job

"do i need to list my household members on my snap recertification do i need to list my household members on my snap application if we are both independent adults and they already receive snap benefits or are you just supposed to list them if they are going to be using/sharing the benefits as well

i am supposed to recertify for snap but it looks like in my original application i didn't list my household member* who i've always lived with i am not sure why or what to do i don't want to risk messing up my case or eligibility 
*i am an independent adult living with a non-dependent but elderly/disabled family member who doesn't work and requires rent assist etc

i *think* i vaguely remember being told not to list my family member in the application because i am only applying for assistance for myself plus they don't contribute to my income/bills don't have an income and they already receive benefits for snap/disability 

(either that or i believe a social worker told me that if do list household members i need to say that they don't share my groceries to be eligiblei can't remember)

------

anyway i don't want to lie or get in trouble and our address is the same--she has been listed on previous applications and tenant/rent history etc--so it's pretty easy to find out i live with someone else but if i do list her now it will look like i was intentionally lying before

and again these questions about her also aren't relevant to my case because she can't work or help with bills etcshe doesn't need to share benefits/my benefits aren't for the household

what i really need to know and can't find anywhere else is how could i possibly get caught if i am honest about income tell nobody about my situation (except parents) and use a po box as my address would a fraud investigation be done on me

my questions are:

* what can i do to avoid any suspicion 
* would they try to randomly check-up on me
* what punishments do i face if i am caught
* subjective but in your honest opinion is it even worth the risk

"renewal probably not processed worker potentially lied (ca) so much confusion going on with my case and i apologize in advance for the enormity of this post but i'm trying to be thorough
i've been on calfresh for a while now i submitted my renewal late
it was due / i submitted it online / as soon as i was aware because i know from experience that waiting until the last day of the month deadline it sometimes won't get processed 
obviously got the notice saying my benefits would be done if not received by /

a few days later though i get a notice saying my benefits are increased from $ to $ starting / calfresh case is still ""discontinued"" online though 
i also just applied for calworks and had my interview plus submitted my documents i tried multiple throughout the month to check and see if i got the correct documents for processing left at least  messages a week no callback
called the main office where i live and was told that it seemed i got everything correct and to try the supervisor but as far as my calfresh the worker i spoke to recommended calling the benefit service center to make sure it gets processed
ok well i did my part so why not for days i call the bsc and can't get anyone just a recording stating high volume of calls and to try again 
as it's now the last day of the month my calfresh is reading ""discontinued"" calworks is pending and there are no pending deposits for my ebt card i'm panicking because my kids need to eat
i call the branch in my city stating i know this isn't the right department but i need to know that my calfresh benefits won't be late
a very pleasant and helpful worker i spoke to said everything looked great and was being processed i got it on time so nothing would be late also you now have  days to submit your renewal because of covid
i've literally never heard of this but figured he works there so he would know i'm pretty sure i've been past  days late in the last  years and didn't get an extra month but i could be mistaken
anyway i'm still not seeing any pending benefits posted as they usually are and i'm upset as i won't be able to call until monday and we are barely getting by on food

has anyone been investigated for food stamp fraud after closing your case because you no longer need them basically i had food stamps but then chose to close my case i no longer receive them has anyone been investigated after closing their case if so for what reason
worforce is denying me stamps after only  cycles of benefits 😔 (in texas) i cant believe this 😔
"i could use some advice yesterday at : in the morning some man showed up at my house with a sheriff he's from the fraud department for my county he was here to talk about my foodstamps 
my dad is a well off man and he pays all my bills this man questioned how my dad could afford all this on his salary i was stunned i told him the truth my dad's very wealthy and he doesn't just pay my bills but he buys me whatever i want 
then they questioned about my son's biological father the situation is tricky because i don't want to go after child support i'm not even sure if the man on the birth certificate is even my son's biological father but they don't seem to care this man asked if my dad lived with me he asked if my son's father lived with me he asked to go through my drawers ""well if no one else lives here than i can look through your drawers to see who's clothes are in there"" 
i said no and started crying 
so then he asked if i work i told him the truth i'm not fit to work i have an issue speaking to men after i was raped and abused a few years back it was a pretty big deal a lengthy court trial and i've lost multiple jobs over my inability to approach men the longest job i've ever been able to keep was  working besides my father and i ended up getting fired because i couldn't work if my dad wasn't there with me they were very accommodating in the beginning but the business went under 

the house i live in belonged to my child's grandfather i stayed here and helped him near the end of his life when he passed away my dad took on the bills and my son and i have lived in the house ever since but it's not in my name 
my sons ""father"" works out of state  months of the year in a different state every week checked into a hotel while i know he's around here and i've seen him i don't understand why i'm being punished for that this man kept hounding me as i stood in front of him in my skimpy night gown at one point he asked me if i knew a ""something holt"" i said ""no i don't know anyone by that name"" which i truly don't and i can't remember what the first name was or i'd look him up on facebook he then asked if i hung out with any of my child's fathers friends i do hang out with the wife of one of them but not his friends it was so strange 

so here this guy was with a cop besides him treating me like a straight up criminal when i have absolutely nothing on my record i've never been in trouble my life was going to be perfect until i became ""disabled"" i was brutally raped a few years back and it destroyed my personality i disappointed my entire family i tried to commit suicide  times before i turned  and was hospitalized each time i don't receive any disability for my ptsd which i can understand makes it hard to prove but i have plenty of medical records and proof to prove i have an invisible illness i cried so hard and begged them to leave and let me get my son back to sleep the cop said ""if she says we have to leave we have to leave"" the man handed me his card and told me to give him a call i told him i would try to but honestly i can't seem to pick up that fucking phone and call 

if anyone has any advice for me i'd be so grateful i'm very confused and scared this man really didn't seem to care that i was a single women alone at : in the morning who got woken up to the pounding on the door that went on for  minutes saw two men towering over me he didn't care that i was terrified and he was extremely cold and rude i'm lost please help"
"has anyone ever been found guilty of an ivp i failed to disclose my husbands income because i felt we truly needed the help we had to move over night due to getting sick from our rental house ceiling being covered in black mold it set us back thousands that we didn't have we were practically homeless for a month (we have  kids) &amp; have been playing catch up ever since then about a year ago i found out that my ex husband was using drugs (meth &amp; heroin) i found out because our daughter (who is ) went to visit him &amp; i couldn't get in touch with him for  hours i finally drove to his place &amp; she answered the door told me he wouldn't wake up &amp; the was a pistol on the table in the living room she told me she was hungry &amp; tried to make macaroni in the microwave but couldn't figure it out he was passed out &amp; i couldn't wake him i took her &amp; couldn't allow her to go back hired an attorney &amp; spent thousands that once again i didn't have fighting to keep her out of his custody while he was unfit i'm telling you this because we genuinely needed the help but on paper we didn't so i lied was it wrong yes i regret it very very badly sometimes i feel as though the system isn't to help people who work &amp; genuinely need it looking at our gross income makes it look like we are rich on paper when in all reality we pay over  in taxes &amp; insurance fees every check &amp; bring home much less than what it says we gross we get  paychecks a month &amp;  of them pays our rent &amp; that is it it is  regardless it was wrong &amp; i know that &amp; i hate it

 i closed my case a few weeks ago because i decided that i didn't want to be dishonest again i did it  times in a row though we ended up getting around  for a year and a half looking at that # i feel sick it doesn't seem like we had that much because i always felt like we were struggling i am so worried that they are going to investigate my case &amp; that i will go to jail for years the guilt that i am experiencing is overwhelming i wish that i could turn myself in &amp; offer to pay it all back without going to jail honestly when doing these things i didn't feel like a huge crime i felt like i was in a hopeless place &amp; it seemed like the right thing to do i didn't realize the severity of what i did until doing some research into the matter i love my kids more than life itself leaving them feels like death when i think about it i feel as though i'm going to their funeral i honestly can't even put into words how much this is effecting me 

so i suppose what i'm asking is - has anyone ever been investigated after intentionally not disclosing income if so what happened please help ease my mind some i know that i could potentially face jail time i just hope that isn't common in my situation i have never sold them or done drugs i just fed my kids i received  a month 

please someone help me stop worrying so much no one has reached out to me &amp; i believe it has been a month now but it is all that i can think about i am so defeated i cry at traffic lights i can't focus on my kids because my mind is always on this i'm not present anymore i'm truly not a bad person i just made a terrible mistake"
"florida man raids car dealership after trying to buy bmw with food stamps a florida man is stoking confusion after he tried to buy a $ bmw with his credit card and ebt card – and apparently wouldn’t take no for an answer

authorities say the perplexed managers at an auto dealership in pompano beach “declined -year-old nicholas jackson’s business” when he offered to pay with food stamps

but it didn’t just stop at that jackson “appeared determined to have that bmw one way or another” the martin county sheriff’s office said in a release

the next day the man allegedly broke into the dealership and stole the car along with keys to as many as  other vehicles

but he didn’t get very far detectives who tracked down the car later found jackson stalled at an intersection when he ran out of gas and apparently didn’t have money to refuel

"food stamp certification - galveston county texas i'm hoping someone can please explain clearly why i was just denied my food stamp renewal i'm having a real hard time fully understanding they said we make about $ over  


i have a  person household  adults and  children ages   and months  
our gross income was $ for the month of june net income $  
i understand there is a standard deduction for expenses but since i don't know what it is  
rent $  
car $  
auto ins $  
internet $  
phone $  
gas $  
electric $  
water $  
child support $  


the texas health and human services commission website says the income limit is $ for   
while typing this a lady tried to explain it to me she told me the system shows the income limit for  is $ she also told me that because our income went up so much since the last time we were approved they chose not to give me the standard deduction for expenses she also said they calculated our income $ over what i show - $ of that is from my unearned income (child support) which i understand however i don't understand how they added $ to my fiancé's gross income i've checked and rechecked it  


how is this exactly fair i understand income limits fluctuate but their own website shows a drastically different number from what she told me it was also how is the fact my fiancé got a better job reason to not give me the standard deduction for expenses how can she tell me we were almost $ over when my math shows we'd be over more than that based on the numbers i was given  
finally is it even worth it to appeal the decision"

"[pa]is my cousin in big trouble my cousin applied for food stamps in around  and successfully received them since then  however there's one problem  they didn't put down that they had a checking account in all that time  some details:

-they never had a job or any income
-the account never had a lot of money in it and not enough to go over what i've heard was the limit for resources in accounts(is it around $)
-the only money that was ever in the account was sporadic stuff like birthday gift money(the highest from that would be maybe $ bucks at most) money other relatives put into that account to purchase things online and very small amounts of money my cousin would manage to save here and there helping out at home
-the reason my cousin didn't tell them about the account was because my aunt told them that if they gave them that information the student loan people would get access to it as well and automatically take out what little bit was there making the account unusable for anyone

my cousin recently started worrying about this and had a renewal coming up  he wasn't sure if he should add the account info now or if it's too late since so much time has passed and would just get him into trouble even bringing it up  he also wasn't sure if they'd want his entire account history or what  would it be possible to just give the account info and not have to mention he's had it for years  the state is pa btw for added information  i wasn't sure what to tell him any advice  he's worried our aunt may have unintentionally caused him to get into a situation where he can go to jail"

"calfresh - moved into nursing home this if for la county

hello

my  year old mother receiving calfresh moved into a nursing home mostly for physical therapy to be able to walk the idea is to have her stay there temporarily but there is no telling how long she will stay if she is able to walk decently enough she will be out of there meanwhile we are wondering

 do we have to call and inform or are the funds cut off automatically once the system registers that she is in a nursing home
 if it's cut off will the calfresh card with the existing funds stop logically the funds should stop coming but the existing funds should remain considering they were entitled funds that couldn't be used in time (cash had to be paid for non-ebt food) generally when a person's income rises above calfresh qualifications his funds stop but his existing remain
 i am still buying her food from the market that the nursing staff is serving her for the simple reason that she is picky and does not eat their food the staff reported her eating only % portions when she was served for the first few days and that something needed to be done for her nutrition i might ask for staff to document this if need be this is probably an exceptional situation for a social worker to answer"

“you are not eligible for benefits - (tw a-  tac   cfr )
you failed to provide required information by the due date as explained below - (b-)” now that i finally got around to seeing if i could re-apply i’m facing the question “is anyone living in your home disqualified from getting cash help or food benefits anywhere in the united states” i’m not too sure if that’s what i would fall under as i never directly saw the word disqualified in any of the mail i got but i was thinking of how ineligible and disqualified are kind of synonyms thank you in advance"

"the hr department at my previous job is being absurd and unhelpful with my  form let me first clarify that these are not my food stamps my dad is unemployed due to disability which leaves me as the sole wage earner in the household about a month ago i left my job due to the intense suicidal thoughts i began to have due to working there and now i need a  form filled out so that my dad can continue to get food stamps to feed my family

the hr rep that i went to about the form told me that she couldn't fill out the form because my employment was terminated she directed me to a third party company to get it taken care of

this third party company not only has an absurd number of hoops to jump through but also has incorrect  information on my file and also shows record of continuous unsuccessful attempts by the utah dws to access my information

earlier today i called the hr rep again and explained to her that the third party company was unhelpful and that i needed her assistance to get the form taken care of somehow

she spewed some excuses about how other employees in the past hadn't had any issues with it and basically told me that she didn't care and didn't have any help to offer

the next thing i did was call her boss and explain the same thing to him i was more than a little frustrated and i let him know (still in a reasonably professional demeanor) that the way he is handling this is completely unacceptable and that i expect him to do the bare minimum and just sign the form to confirm that my employment there had ended

from here the conversation degraded:

&amp;#xb;

me: look i need this form signed to confirm that i don't work there anymore

&amp;#xb;

him: i can't do that; you don't work here anymore

&amp;#xb;

me: i know i don't work there anymore that's why i need you to sign this form that *says* i don't work there anymore

&amp;#xb;

him: i'm not authorized to do that because you don't work here anymore

&amp;#xb;

me: okay can you help me get to someone who is authorized to sign this form

&amp;#xb;

him: look i've already told you there's nothing i can do you need to go through \[third party company\] to get the form filled out

&amp;#xb;

me: i've called them a dozen times they have incorrect information and are unable to give me any sort of definitive answer about how they can help me with the form

&amp;#xb;

it was here that he quit even trying to give relevant answers instead he kept repeating the bullshit about the third party company and after i started to get more frustrated he began to give me flack for not putting in two weeks before quitting

literally any time i tried to steer the conversation back to the topic of him simply helping me get access to somebody who could sign the form he kept saying ""you didn't even finish  weeks""

i essentially snapped at this point and pretty much yelled:

&amp;#xb;

""you know what \[hr rep\] i wanted to put in  weeks but i can guarantee you that i'd have put a bullet between my eyes before those weeks were up so thanks \[hr rep\] i really appreciate how apathetic and unhelpful you've been and i admire how you refuse to take any fucking responsibility you really give a sense of professionalism to your workplace fuck you \[hr rep\] i hope you sleep well while my family starves because of the shitty job i quit""

&amp;#xb;

i'm pretty sure he hung up at some point during this rant but i was too angry at the time so i don't really remember as soon as i finished i broke down crying and had to collect myself so i could get ready for my shift (which i was conveniently an hour late to)

&amp;#xb;

fuck kroger fuck smith's maybe this isn't the right place to ask but if anyone here has experience dealing with this type of thing i'd appreciate any help you can give i'm literally just so done with this"

"massachusetts snap - do they check assets long story short: my income was reduced recently to half the poverty level (i'm not sure for how long) and it isn't enough pay for rent/ food/ expenses/ medical expenses (i have insurance but it doesn't cover everything as i use some supplements/ alternative treatments to regulate my hormones since i didn't respond well to the prescription medications) i have some savings that i can live off of for a few months but then i'll be screwed after those few months are up if my income doesn't increase again

i'm considering applying for snap i read that the state doesn't ask about your assets in most cases however it says that ""income earned on assets"" such as interest on savings accounts or dividends you receive is something they may look at my savings accounts have an apy of % so i literally get pennies every month on each of my accounts also i own approximately $ in stocks and will get a dividend of  cents every now and then

i also read that vehicles don't count as assets so technically someone can have a brand new car worth $+ and be eligible for snap benefits as long as they are low income yet they may not receive it if they have $+ in the bank that doesn't make much sense to me

"is this normal/what can i do ga every time i am up for renewal i provide the requested documents but the caseworker always finds something that i “didn’t provide” and closes my case for example last renewal my case was closed because “i didn’t provide requested documents” but it turned out the caseworker was just confused because i’m a contract employee and don’t have itemized paystubs 

i was up for renewal again in may documentation for my income was requested i provided everything and attached a note to explain it denied/case closed again it was impossible to get in touch with my caseworker  i couldn’t even find her correct phone number i can’t talk to anybody else on the main number anymore they just refer to the case worker and won’t even answer simple questions (would not even tell me her number) i finally got in touch with the worker and found out she wanted my husband’s income info too and that’s why we were denied i had just provided his income a couple weeks before that for our transitional medical assistance since his information was not requested and i had just provided it i didn’t know that it was needed again anyway i uploaded everything she needed that same day it has now almost been a full month (since providing husband’s info) and our case is still closed i call the caseworker to follow up every  to  days and she just tells me “i’m so sorry i’m going to reopen your case i just haven’t had a chance to do it” in the meantime i’m worried about how to buy groceries and feed my kids and pay the rent 

can someone please help i don’t know what else to do

eta: i could understand i guess if the worker is simply busy and overloaded but i’ve had  separate conversations with her in which she said she was going to finish everything that same day and even asked me to call back a few hours later to confirm when i call back she doesn’t answer and doesn’t return the call and our case is still closed i’m so frustrated"

my situation : i am currently living with my brother who is a police officer he pays $ rent for a  bed  bath apartment by working for the apartment complex management as a courtesy officer off hours currently my parents are giving me $ a month to pay for my half of the utility bills and food while i'm going through the ssi process i have not worked in over  years 

so here are my questions :

- am i considered ""disabled"" during the process of getting disability benefits i have to meet a (newly instated) work hour requirement per week unless i am 'disabled' in order to be eligible for snap in my state i've been given contradictory info regarding whether or not i would be considered disabled
- do i need to disclose the $ a month i get from my parents is this considered 'unearned income'
- should i put $ as my rent or $ (aka the price of rent without my brother's benefits) 

i'm currently filing online and so far i've selected that i am ""disabled"" that my rent is $ and i have not added my $ a month budget under ""unearned income"" just yet 

any help would be greatly appreciated thanks for reading"

i was deemed ineligible based on the first one i explained my hours were reduced and that the second and third paystubs reflected that i also uploaded the note from my doctor requesting fmla leave for me detailing the reduced schedule i would need to work i was told that form only referred to my time in the hospital and have since had further requests denied two more times even after a wild goose chase to obtain more documents

not at starvation level quite yet but i am now out of the essentials i'm not sure if i should just keep appealing or what unlike other times i've applied i haven't actually spoken with my case worker this time every time i call a worker says they'll leave a message for them i'm not sure if this is a covid situation or what the heck is going on"

i'm a journalism master's student compiling a thesis on snap/p-ebt/ebt in the context of food insecurity in new york city i'm looking to speak with anyone who has used the program at any point over the past couple of years (ideally i'll speak with people who used it prior to covid and those who applied after covid's arrival) i'd love to hear from anyone with intimate experience with the program or knowledge of its operations i'm looking to better understand the everyday decisions (how accessible is the program how households choose to use it do households still look to charitable programs like food banks etc)

if this is something you're willing to discuss please reach me by dm and i'll take you through more specifics right now i just want to put the call out there to get a better survey of people's experience with the program

i do want to emphasize something so apologies for the length: food insecurity is not synonymous with poverty nor is poverty synonymous with food insecurity one of the most destructive narratives that has emerged since the pandemic is that food insecurity is some kind of new phenomenon in the us  i believe too many stories are written about the mere existence of these realities as if they haven't existed before (this speaks to a broader issue about how media organizations are built and how they cover communities unfamiliar to them) 

what is important to me is how people are adapting in these increasingly challenging times and what role government assistance plays in that if i can promise you anything it is that i will listen carefully about your experience with the snap program and how it factors into your everyday life

if this interests you please dm me i think it's important that the public is better aware of how the snap and (p)-ebt programs are designed and how individuals interact with them

thank you"

if some combination of adhd boredom and a desire to help science compelled me to sign up to some website last week to participate in research studies and those research studies compensated me even $ this month i stand to lose $ worth of groceries am i understanding this right and then we get into the issue that this is technically self-employment income timing of payments is uncertain not to mention it's all paid in gbp just to make this small amount of money more complex

"california food stamps - accidental fraud using benefits in other state + days tl // dr: used calfresh benefits for  months in another state due to close family friend needing assistance after cancer diagnosis now being investigated for fraud rude rep on phone interview what’s gonna happen from here

back in april i received a call from super nice woman in fraud investigation informing me my account was flagged and in a perfect world i would’ve notified her i told her i wasn’t sure when i was coming back since everything was moment to moment with me even being out there in the first place aka unplanned af 

in an emotionless world based solely off facts and rules i can understand how she had little patience for me and assumed i intentionally committed fraud 

i guess i’m wondering now how the investigation process goes and what to expect from here will anything be sent to the address of my family friend am i eligible for ebt in the state i’m in now with a ca drivers license — out of state dl was part of the reason i didn’t apply for one out here i wasn’t sure how the process worked with out of state dl and couldn’t get ahold of anyone at local ebt office without giving my personal info out and i didn’t want to be flagged for fraud by asking about out of state stuff i know very little about gov benefits and i was afraid it would seem suspicious and auto flag clearly uncle sam makes me anxious 😩🥴

"confused about household rules california san diego county 

i live with my ex spouse (we are both women) who is disabled on ssi we separated and divorced in  we have two kids she lives in our home in her own room does not buy or prepare food with anyone (she actually has a provider who comes help her with that) and our finances are separate 

she only gets $ a month from ssi with her rent of $ utilities added car insurance gas etc it leaves her with about $ a week for food she has to wait for the once a month when some neighbors bring some expired leftover food from stores that only last her about  days because the portions are very limited this isn’t enough for her she can’t do anything with the kids because she has no money 

i am not responsible for her financially or in any way i do not want to have to buy her food when i can barely afford my own for me and the kids

but while she qualifies for calfresh on her own they are refusing to separate the household despite the above facts can someone explain the logic to me if anything i believe she needs them more having kids in the home she can’t financially support during her visitation time what is she supposed to do there is nowhere else for her to move with her income so low but she shouldn’t be starving because of this rule nor should i be forced to buy her food (i’m actually not allowed to) when my budget is already so tight for having to pay for everything for the kids and paying more rent too we are not a couple we are not together we live separate lives and she follows her visitations times with the kids"

 i wasn't expecting this so obviously i couldn't warn my bosses that a random number was gonna call them so of course they didn't answer because of this i didn't get approved and will have to re-apply

"extremely low bmi and expedited food assistance eligibility am i the only one who feels that extremely low bmi should be an important determining factor in eligibility especially when it comes to expedited benefits

my bmi is about ; i am '"" and weigh lbs i am  years old i know that my bmi is not quite at fatal levels yet but it's sure getting close and has been dropping pretty rapidly as of late

&amp;#xb;

from here on out most of this post is going to be detailing my application process with access florida as well as giving some medical background to my situation i'm also probably going to vent quite a bit so feel free to skip to the end for a tldr

&amp;#xb;

**my income &amp; access florida application history:**

i've been denied expedited benefits by access florida twice now at this point i've still yet to receive any form of benefits from them the first time i applied i put down that i had an income i had just started working in online transcription apparently i picked the worst time in history to do so it wasn't bad at first but the work started to dry up very quickly i began to see murmurs of discontent on the forums everybody was complaining about a lack of job availability and lower pay rates amongst the few jobs that were available most were attributing this phenomenon to the website's rapid improvement of their ai-generated transcription services which are much cheaper for clients then i saw a lady who claimed to work in medical transcription (which is what i'd hoped to graduate myself into) posting on those very forums stating that she usually comes to this website looking for side work but that her medical transcription work had been drying up so much recently she was now primarily coming to our neck of the woods for a main source of income she also claimed that this was due to ai's rapid improvement in her field

this was when i decided i needed to find a new means of income i can still work on there to get myself some pocket money for the week but that is all it's good for now i'm sure it's only going to get worse if ai is now able to accurately transcribe complex medical terminology the human side of this industry is clinging on for dear life and has no future sustainability in my opinion i'm not sure what i'm going to do for future income now but i know that i should choose carefully i can't exactly afford to take warehouse jobs like i did in my younger days i would burn way too many calories in a labor-intensive work environment such as that i tried working as a picker at walmart about a year ago and i actually had to stop working on my third day because i was suffering from sudden bouts of tachycardia and getting very short of breath while on the job i highly doubt this was due to any kind of mental reason such as anxiety as my mood on the job was very optimistic and i was actually somewhat enjoying the work i've also never had a history of panic attacks or any issues like this back when i was younger and healthier it seems to be a health issue that pops up when my weight dips below about lbs my experience at walmart prompted me to obtain medical coverage as soon as possible in any form i can get it something i probably should have done sooner i've now got that medical coverage but my first appointment with my selected pcp is not available until jan rd next year

so what happened with my access florida application throughout this at first they told me i was eligible for expedited benefits they then retracted that statement of eligibility and wound up denying my application entirely when i couldn't prove my income income that i foolishly reported based on speculation of how well i thought i would do this year only to have the transcription rug pulled out from under me by robots okay fine but why deny me entirely assuming i can't prove any income shouldn't that only increase my eligibility for expedited benefits

to that end i've now reapplied on access florida while reporting no income just to see if i could possibly get expedited benefits this time i've temporarily stopped doing any transcription work as i just want to see if access florida will give me benefits under any circumstances a friend of mine has been graciously helping me cover food expenses in the meantime i wouldn't have done this if he couldn't afford to help me over the next couple of weeks apparently this time i'm not even eligible for expedited benefits right out of the gate there wasn't even any time for someone to review my case just automatically determined that i'm ineligible i also just got over covid which certainly did not help i lost another –lbs throughout the ordeal so logging back into access florida after getting over it and seeing that i'm not eligible for expedited benefits this time was kind of the catalyst for me making this post the only possible reason i could see for this is because i own the house that i live in which is a homesteaded property it is my livelihood not a means of income not sure why this should make me ineligible

&amp;#xb;

**why i feel this is wrong:**

knowing that people who have much more fat stores on their bodies to help sustain them are collecting benefits while i'm not getting a dime as i steadily disintegrate is utterly frustrating and quite frankly sounds like a symptom of a broken system i have an appointment with my doctor jan rd next year (soonest i could get in) to help figure out why i'm losing weight but i know i'm not eating enough calories lately as i simply can't afford it in the meanwhile extra calories would really help to *keep me alive* i've lost lbs in the past two months dropping from  to 

i highly doubt that most others receiving these benefits are actually at risk of dying any time soon but i feel i certainly am bear in mind that *i don't think this at all invalidates their need for said benefits* but shouldn't individuals like myself get a bit of priority or at least not be *rejected entirely* let alone the fact that i'm probably so malnourished the longer this continues the larger my risk for refeeding syndrome upon receiving these benefits becomes

i also understand that bmi is highly criticized as a metric for health but i don't think it can be denied that extreme outliers like myself (say a bmi under  or over ) have severe health risks associated with that number have a look at what true starvation looks like in countries like somalia i doubt most people there have healthy bmis and they are literally dying of starvation

&amp;#xb;

edited to add: my main reason for putting forth this logic is due to empirical evidence that bmi is indeed an important factor in death due to starvation such as this:

from the national library of medicine:

""many empirical studies have observed the point of death of people from starvation and have concluded that once an individual reaches a bmi of  the probability of recovery even if the subject is re-fed is virtually zero""

[

if that's to be believed i would argue that the line should certainly be drawn somewhere when bmi reaches dangerously low levels i don't think that high bmi counts should disqualify anyone but extremely low bmi counts should almost guarantee approval if it almost meets the criteria for feeding intubation why not for food assistance

&amp;#xb;

&amp;#xb;

**closing notes:**

i don't plan to use these benefits for very long i don't believe it's fair to the rest of society to mooch off of everybody else for long periods unless the beneficiary is disabled or somehow unable to resolve/improve their situation with time that is not the case for me i will be able to stand on my own two feet again at some point—but i would have thought that situations like mine were the reason these benefits were put into effect in the first place not for someone who has been living off government assistance for the past x years and has no plans to change that or better themselves anytime soon

anybody else have a similar experience to mine am i just in too much of a minority being underweight in a predominantly obese society am i just being biased am i wrong in anything i'm saying here i can see how this post may come across as elitist or entitled but it's just getting really sad stepping on that scale every day and watching myself disappear i do not want this i am not anorexic/bulimic nor have i ever been

any additional advice would also be much appreciated i've already shifted my focus of whatever foods i can afford to calorie-dense foods and eating more meals throughout the day in smaller portions as opposed to trying to stuff many calories down in one sitting and then not eating for hours i've been trying to physically rehabilitate myself into a more strength-focused muscle-building exercise routine is there anything else i can do to help remedy my situation in the meantime

&amp;#xb;

&amp;#xb;

thanks to all who took the time to read this essay of a post and i'd be grateful to hear any insights or opinions you may have on this matter

a tldr for those who didn't read (i don't blame you lol): should extremely low bmi (under ) in conjunction with low/zero income be an immediate qualifying factor for food assistance namely expedited food assistance also do you have any advice to help me gain or at least maintain my body weight right now while i wait to get to a doctor at what point should i consider hospitalization"

(btw i also didn’t receive anything in the mail) 

i called and spoke to someone on the customer service line and she said i could also do the sar by getting the sar pdf form online and submitting it manually via the benefitscal portal however she also said that no matter which way i electronically submitted i have to call the county just to tell them that i submitted the sar and to ask them to process them she said if i just submitted the sar thru benefitscal it won’t go to them/notify them that seems crazy and the fact that i have to call just for that is also super annoying (i spent over  hours on hold just to speak to the right person so having to do that again just to tell them i submitted seems so stupid)

seems wierd if i cant have more than  because i just started doordash and i made about  this month but there is a % business tax on doing doordash self employed that i will have to set aside for paying taxes at the end of the year   if there is a $ limit how am i supposed to set aside the tax money and have any money saved for emergency's such as vet bills flat tire car repairs etc"

questions about foodstamps hi i have a couple of questions regarding applying for food stamps first off i’m in florida in case that makes a difference so i wasn’t awarded work-study this semester meaning i would have to meet the  hours per month minimum for food stamps but i only work - hours a week max (i’m a full time student) i was looking into it and apparently you can volunteer i currently volunteer six hours a week and i was wondering if that could supplement the missing hours i would need to have the  hour minimum could i put i work  hours a week and volunteer six and that could count as the  hour minimum also i’m currently living with a friend who can’t get food stamps because she’s not a green card holder and since we split groceries i was wondering if i could list her on my application to get extra funds to cover us both or would she have to be a citizen thank you for reading this

"fl snap - caseworker may be using incorrect amounts (gross instead of net) i've been struggling with my application process since early july the online submission and update process is not great and i feel like the system is purposely more difficult than it needs to be

trying to get through on the phone interview is as difficult as everyone knowsand this was prior to hurricane ian

my spouse is disabled so the means testing is scaled for that;  you can qualify using the gross or net income amounts  when we initially applied i was receiving unemployment and was told that our gross income was too high but nothing was ever said about qualifying using our net  i started working two weeks into september so our income went up by an entire $/month  

early this week they finally () made a determination on the changes to income i filed in september we received $ benefit for september with a letter explaining that we don't qualify for october because our monthly gross income is now too high - again with the gross income limits and a mention of an income limit amount that i don't recognize 

i can't get through on the number listed on the notice letter a recording says it's no longer available for interviews and i must call the  number - but you can't really get through there either because either the system is too busy or if you hold for a representative your call is disconnected

i know it's especially busy now if there were a better way of checking the figures on the website i would do it &amp; save the trouble of trying to speak with someone

are the caseworkers aware of the fact that households with a disabled member can qualify using either the gross income or if that is too high then also using the net income"

"food stamps retailer only providing partial ebt eligibility online i feel like something is wrong here i am trying to order stuff online for a large grocery chain which has accepted ebt for the longest time they went online within the past  years and started accepting ebt online problem is a huge chunk of their products are not ebt eligible online when they are in person

today i tried to order supplies to make raw vegan brownies (and personal care items i badly need the raw vegan brownies are to up my daily calories because i am trying hard to eat lots of vegetables but it is leaving me at a caloric deficit on my eating days which is bad) nine of their date products--nine--were not ebt eligible but the nonorganic option was one of their own in store brands of cocoa powder wasn't ebt eligible

i searched tomatoes while dealing with one of the customer service agents who kept playing dumb and acting like it was a ""technical issue"" when i was calling to try to request or start the process or flag these items for ebt eligibility i found more than  items which were all cold food items which weren't ebt eligible

how can they be accepting ebt online but not accept it for a huge portion of their products a manager said they're ""working on it"" and that it's a retailer thing but i am not ordering from a warehouse i am ordering from a brick and mortar store where one of the store employees would be walking around the store and bagging everything to hand me so claiming it's a retailer issue when the products are coming directly out of the same store i would have been able to walk into and purchase with ebt had it not been a pandemic sounds like bullshit"

i tried to find more information about this online but all i saw was something about private scholarships in terms of what can be deducted when considering income and my financial aid is from public sources basically i just want to check and see if it's correct that that portion of my financial aid counts as income or if i should call back about it soon because this has been a big hit for me in terms of finances

"my experiences for dealing with ebt theft (california) hi everyone today as of / i’ve finally got my stolen amount reimbursed into my ebt account here’s what i go through with the whole process: 
 when you found out your ebt cash benefit was stolen first thing you need to do is call the number at the back of the ebt card and talk to a customer service representative to report your card has been skimmed and tell them how much money has been stolen remember to ask for a claim number
 go to the police station and file an report in my case i went to the sheriffs department make sure you mention to the officer the report is for ebt theft and it’s requested by county worker
 after you gather those two informations(claim number and police report) you can go to your nearest social service county office to fill out the ebt、ebta、pa、pa forms the good things for fill out those forms in county office is the county workers will help you fill out those forms and make sure there’s no mistake while you fill those out; they will give you a “receipt” saying that they receive those forms and police report and they can issue you a new ebt card so you don’t need to wait for the new card in mail
 give it about  business days if you don’t receive any letters regarding the claim you need to call the dpss customer services number because they are overwhelmed by the large number of ebt theft cases now sometimes your claim might be left behind when you call in the customer service just mention that you don’t receive any letters or follow ups for your ebt card claim they’ll leave a note in the system or expedite your case movement

for my case it took  days for the stolen benefit to be reimbursed 

edit  i’m in los angeles county

edit  thanks for the heads up from u/sweetpotatoeart you need to file the claim with county within  days"

"indiana denial: am i supposed to have utility allowance (shelter cost) hi i hope someone can help me i applied for snap i'm disabled (ss) have an adult child residing with me (no income with medical issues so i'm supporting) i meet all the resource/gross income standards

i just got the denial and looked at the financial summary printed up on the back (i also went back to the program manual i downloaded but i am only looking at information for household with elderly/disabled so as not to get more confused) 

according to the table they show me as above net income by $ my rent is just at % so there is no (excess) shelter deduction but i also pay all utilities (electric/gas/water sewer trash) and there is no utility allowance ($ listed) i did qualify for liheap this past winter what i found for information is this: **utility allowance** ***heating and cooling: if a household pays utility bills for heating and cooling or receives over $ in heating assistance from liheap this deduction amount can be claimed (but no other utility deductions) then it gives an amount;*** there are also categories for a standard utility allowance or providing for each utility paid

at the usda site it says: the amount of the shelter deduction is capped at (or limited to) $ unless one person in the household is elderly or disabled the limit is higher in [alaska hawaii and guam]( ***for a household with an elderly or disabled member all shelter costs over half of the household's income may be deducted***

***am i right in thinking that i should therefore have an mount listed in the ""utility allowance""*** that when added to rent would result in ""allowable shelter deduction"" (amount over % adjusted income) that would bump my income down to hit below net income and provide a little help i'm pretty stressed out and frazzled plus just getting over covid so appreciate anyone who can help clarify this"

"mn food stamps q hi can i still use the money leftover on my ebt card

i’ve tried to email my county twice telling them to take me off of food stamps and tried calling all the numbers but got no response i know we are now in the reapplication period and i’m just not gonna reapply and hopefully that takes care of it but

in june they still deposited money into my account even though i already emailed them saying i have a job again

i’m a server so i’m definitely still in an uncertain income spot and the leftover money would be really helpful but i don’t wanna use it if i could get in trouble

any info"

watch where you checkout apparently some stores are finding skimmers at their self checkouts and that may be how ebt scammers are getting customer info it makes sense that they would go for the self checkouts as they are not monitored as closely probably as traditional checkouts also using your ebt card online to shop might not be as secure as you have to give the pin to checkout

"snap benefits in ohio approved and denied i've been trying to get benefits since / my worker said i was barely over income requirements i let her know my husband would not be eligible for unemployment as he would be unable to work and she said that would make me eligible

i was waiting on documentation from unemployment when they processed a payment

i contacted my worker to let her know that was likely a mistake she said i had until / to upload the necessary documents and to call her to let her know and that i would be eligible for snap and medical for my family (which is huge because my insurance through my employer is literally / of my income) i got the notification from unemployment on wednesday that he's not receiving unemployment and that was an overpayment we have to return i uploaded it the same day and called  to let her know but her direct line wasn't connecting to voicemail i called the main number and left a general message for her

she called me back yesterday and said that she got the information but she wouldn't be my worker anymore and have a nice day and hung up

i checked my online portal today and i have approvals and denials all dated / the denials say i'm over the income requirements and my husband doesn't meet the work search requirements

he is in the exceptions group as listed in the document so i'll upload that documentation today (i wish she would have told me earlier to add that)

so would that be what puts me over the income requirements is this just some sort of clerical error unfortunately i won't have any answers until monday at the earliest but why put me through all this if my income is over anyway  if anyone has any similar issues or knows more about the system i'd greatly appreciate it i was really hoping for that money since it said i'd get it (yesterday) i was really hoping to eat this weekend

&amp;#xb;

&amp;#xb;

edit: i just wanted to update in case anyone came upon this in a similar situation my denials were for october since i was over income for that month (which i already knew) my approvals were for november 

the notice of ineligibility because of my husband's work search requirements was an auto generated notice and does not apply in my case since he's exempt 

apparently they all have the same date due to my information for both months being processed at the same time because of waiting on documentation from unemployment "
"[california] case worker filed an appeal without me asking discriminatory i was trying to get emergency benefits and i feel like the case workers were honestly very bad at handling it and did not want to give me the benefits she was like 'you didn't even use any food stamps yet' when i was trying to get my benefits for august and ignored my calls for a month until i contacted the office she then said that i didn't submit it on time or the appeal wouldn't be happening which isn't true--the case worker didn't wait the  days needed for documentation

i then contacted the appeals/hearing worker who said she doesn't know if i could get emergency benefits she initially didn't contact me about the hearing and i had to contact her a month after i filed for an appeal it's been  months of back and forth and i found out that she had filed an appeal for me apparently the new appeals worker contacted me and said the other counties said it was okay to give it to me but the la county didn't want to so they filed an appeal can i submit a complaint"

audit question state: louisiana hi just curious how long the federal audit process takes i turned in my paperwork a few weeks ago and didn’t hear anything back from the auditor handling my case so i reached out to them to confirm they had everything from me and they said they did they were still reviewing the paperwork i’m assuming maybe things are backed up with how many people are getting assistance but just curious if there’s a timeline i can expect to hear anything back or if i even will at all i’ve seen a lot of posts about people getting told they were overpaid in assistance so i’m just curious if that’s what they’re determining this is my first federal audit so not really sure how it works thanks

"snap work rules and mandatory eandt location ny

i work full time my wife takes care of the kids picking them up from school dropping them off etc we have  kids ages    and  my wife does not work myself my wife and our kids are under my food stamp account except the oldest

she is listed in general snap work rules but her name isnot listed under e and t assignment

we just got a notice from snap saying that she has to accept any job offered to her 

we called their office and they said that after covid they are starting to make people look for work 

a couple questions about all this

 i thought you only has to look for work if you were receiving temporary assistance or cash assistance 

 the federal government website says if you have any dependants under  you do not have to look for work how is ny making her look for work when we have  kids under   the paper we got from ny dss says  but the federal government says  how can ny override the federal government rules

 how can she possibly work with her taking care of  kids each kid goes to adifferent school getting out at different times etc this would require a babysitter which would nullify her income from working at all it would be better in this case to drop my wife from my food stamp account so shedoesnt have to work taking care of the household of  people is a job it justdoesnt pay anything"

"i have no idea what to do so i live in ohio and received food stamps years ago probably around  or  i misplaced the card and forgot about it (i was receiving very little a month and no longer needed it) i re applied for food stamps last year and medicaid and was accepted for both i waited and waited for my card to come only for them to tell me i had to reorder a new card and it wouldn't just re ship because i already had a  card in the past okay no problem 

i just received the card today the problem is there is no balance on the card and i am not able to get ahold of anybody to find out why because the three numbers i called are all automated helplines which do not help i went to [connectebtcom]( (or whatever the website is) to try to create an account or log back in to my old one it is saying that the answers to my security questions are wrong 

i went to [benefitsohiogov]( to see if i could access any information there and i got led to a page having me to call a number to verify my identity i called the number answered the person's questions and somehow failed the identity check i was told to call the ohio benefit's number to do another check but the office is closed 

i called the number on the back of the food stamp card to see if they can help me and i selected the option to hear the latest transactions according to their records money has been loaded on the card and it has been used (they gave me recent dates) but are not providing the year these transactions took place so i am unsure if these are recent or from before 

so with all that being said is it possible somebody stole my identity and is using my card i'm not sure how i failed an identity check twice i don't know who to get ahold of or if there is a seperate number i can call to speak to somebody 

if it helps im  live in columbus and there is literally no reason somebody would want to steal my identity because i have a horrible credit score due to hospital bills and i am sorry if none of this makes sense i am dealing with a lot of health problems atm that cause neurological issues so sometimes i am ""slower"" than usual and things are harder for me to do; ie type talk or think clearly 

i just need some help and i have no idea what to do"
"snap renewal not showing up on website i’m in texas therefore i use the yourtexasbenefits website my snap benefits expire oct st i got two emails on sept  saying it’s time to renew i go to the website and it doesn’t say it’s time to renew and there’s no option to renew i waited weeks checking to see if it would pop up or if i’d get a letter in the mail and nope nothing 

currently on the phone with a representative and she’s telling me that it does show my benefits expire oct st but that it shows them that they’ve been extended for another  months so the representative said that maybe that’s why it doesn’t show to renew

i’m just nervous because i do not have any proof of this extension and i’m afraid benefits will expire and i’ll have to reapply again representative said they’ll mail me a letter once they automatically extend so i’m going to take her word for it

"oh - denied but nothing has changed hi all

i have been on food stamps for the past year through the covid- policy exemptions for college students i was due to reapply at the beginning of april which i did i completed the phone interview and uploaded all required documents to the online portal nothing has changed financially for me in the past year

however when i call in the automated voice says my food stamps have been ""denied"" it now reflects this in my portal as well when i called to clarify the woman said that i was flagged for ""non-compliance of documents"" even though i had uploaded all documents the day of my phone interview the documents are also still in the ""pending verification"" section of my online portal account

when i called the first time to where the woman found i was ""non-compliant"" even though she herself said it didn't make sense from her end from what she saw she said she would add me to a list to be called back no one called back in the time frame listed so i called again last week that woman also said that someone would call me by this friday (/) never got a call

i guess i'm confused on what to do-- i keep getting told i'll get a call back they put me on some ""notice list"" for someone to call me back no one does and i don't have any answers i'm planning on calling right away tomorrow morning again but i'm worried i'll just get the same outcome does anyone have any recommendations as to what i should do

"several very cheap nutritious and tasty meal options when relying on ebt/snap i attended  different culinary schools and have a bas in culinary arts but am only a hobbyist as working in the industry started to quickly ruin my love for cooking anyways i have been trying to find meals with the best ratio of price vs # of servings vs nutrition vs yummies and while i am still playing around with some meals but i wanted to throw out a few suggestions 

all of the prices are from amazon prime fresh which accepts ebt/snap in california at least not sure about other states and does not require a prime membership if using ebt prime fresh has been a life saver letting me have teh chance to really think about what i am buying and adding up prices rather than having to worry about getting to checkout and not having enough ebt they also have a lot more items and the deals are better plus you get free delivery to your door 

the first meal is tuna salad

on amazon fresh these are the ingredients/prices:

starkist chunk light tuna in water  oz pouch starkist chunk light tuna in water  oz pouch $

kraft real mayo creamy &amp; smooth mayonnaise ( fl oz bottle) $

amazon brand - happy belly sweet relish  ounce $

celery  bunch $

yellow onion $

final price: $ however you can get several salads out of the ingredients minus the tuna so i suggest you get  or  of the  oz tuna packets one of them makes enough tuna to last  days with  people eating  sandwiches a day  the biggest issue is that tuna salad has a fridge life of  days meaning you might not even be able to finish it all $ for  weeks of food not bad 

another affordable meal (can be a meal or an ingredient) is brussel sprouts  you can get a  oz bag of trimmed brussel sprouts for $ and all you need is some kosher salt and butter melt the butter in a pan trim the bottom stem off the brussel sprouts so they cook evenly cut in half and place in the pan with a decent pinch of kosher salt over them let them cook until brown or almost looking burnt then flip and continue until they are soft and easy to eat most people can't believe just how yummy they are when fried or baked (never boil icky) plus cheap and amazingly a  oz bag has  calories only which can easily feed - people giving you a filling snack at under $ calories  

if you want to take it further you can go the bubble'n'squeak route by adding a couple eggs after they are done cooking and some cheese  eggs and some cheddar only adds  calories to the meal and an  pack of eggs is under $ and cheese varies a lot but can be found cheap too 

i have also managed to get my ebt to last longer by getting slim fast shake powder $ plus the price of dairy i get the  oz vanilla almond breeze for $ this gives you  meals for $ and is actually pretty effective at weight loss as long as you stick to the   calorie snacks and one meal a day else your body starts to hold on to more fat  and it backfires this is where the brussel sprouts come into play as  calorie snacks 

for a quick and cheap meal stir fry rice-a-roni is $ a box and  actually pretty good

and finally bear creek soups they range from $ to $ and make  large servings of incredibly yummy soup that takes  min or so to cook just pour in the mox add water and boil however one of the best meals they have is the ""damn good chili"" but that does require lb of ground beef and a small can of tomato paste but it lasts for several days and is really good chili other than that i highly recommend the cheddar potato and cheddar brocolli though all of the soups are really good better than any canned soup and they have at least  different flavors

anyways i just wanted to toss out some ideas for anyone struggling with hunger and nutrition while on ebt/snap/etc"

(texas) waiting on renewal interview i submitted my renewal for for snap benefits on the th of september using the website and have been waiting for an interview or letter since normally i get a call within a few day but i know things are taking longer than normal because of covid my renewal says in review still as does my original application from february i usually have my benefits on my card by am on the rd and have yet to receive anything and am starting to panic a little shouldn’t i have heard something from hhs by now
p ebt texas we got the p ebt payment the one time it was given and we were told not to throw the card away because there was a second deposit coming the deadline to fill out the new application was sept  and i read all benefits would be disbursed by sept  has anyone gotten a second payment since the schools are open they no longer provide lunches for the kids at home
"question about adding boyfriend to household (hawaii) thanks in advance for any insight you may have 

i am relatively new to the snap system (approved in early september) currently i live with roommates but we don't share any food or prepare meals together so i am just a single household in january my boyfriend is moving here with me we will be moving in together and he will likely be eligible at that time as well assuming he is eligible and qualified i would prefer that we receive benefits as a household and not just as separate people so that we can share food without being worried about any sort of issues

since i already have an active case but he has never received or applied for benefits what is the correct process for adding him to my ""household"" do i just list him and then they contact him to apply or does he apply and list me and then i also add him at the same time i just don't want to end up with too many cases open and have unexpected problems pop up when trying to get this all worked out"

"[ks] need a medical report form filled out by a doctor but i don't have one what do i do i tried asking my local dcf front desk person about it but she just said ""i've never seen anything like it i don't know i want to go home"" (lol same) and advised that i try to talk to a caseworker but i was hoping you fine folks might have some insight in the meantime

i got a medical report form that has:

  section that i complete which authorizes my doctor or psychologist to provide information
 a nd section that my doctor or psychologist fills out saying whether or not i have mental/medical issues that impact my ability to train or work \[full text of this section at bottom of post\]

 the problem is that the form is due by // and i don't have a doctor or a psychologist yet

i have an appointment with a new doctor the first week of november and i completed an intake with the local mental health center but i won't be assigned to a therapist for another week or two so neither of those will pan out in time for the due date the last doctor i saw was over  months ago in a different state 

should i sent it to my old doctor even though i only saw her for  visits and it was a while ago should i wait until i go to my new doctor and submit the form late have any of you guys seen something like this

"blended family question - montana does anyone know what will happen to my ebt/snap benefits if my co-parent and i move in together i currently live with my grandma and do not work i have three children that are not my co-parent's and one that is his 

i think if we moved in together his income would count against us but would i still be eligible for snap for myself and my three children that are not his we are not married and he does not provide for me or my children - only his child 

i am located in montana

living with my grandma is becoming difficult but i can't afford to lose my snap benefits the child that my partner and i share together has special needs - she had a brain bleed at  weeks old has hydrocephalus (recently had a brain operation and has hardware in her brain and skull) has alagille syndrome (effects multiple organs and body systems) crb related syndrome (extremely rare effects the brain but not much info on it currently) a congenital heart defect liver disease vertebral abnormalities and is delayed i will not put her in daycare (i don't even think a daycare would even accept her would they) so i have to stay home to be her caretaker however if we moved in together i would have to work so i could provide food for myself and my three children that are not his

i'm not sure what to do here 

also what would be considered technically living together i do spend quite a bit of time at my partner's home because we share an infant together (she breastfeeds so she can't be without me) and i also provide him with childcare in his home for his child that is not mine while he works to help him out and he helps me out with my kids sometimes in return could i get in trouble for spending too much time at his house as it could be viewed as us living together i ask because i recently had someone tell me this happened to their friend 

any insight would be appreciated 🙂"
"usda news on online snap &amp; a sneak peak of the future [

in a nutshell summed up - grants for smaller companies / retailers to help bring them on board with online snap i really really hope this goes on to include things like csa's / online ordering from local vendors 

but they also offer this tantalizing clue - 

&gt;usda is currently developing a [pilot program]( to allow snap consumers to use their phones to purchase groceries at the checkout counter and will soon seek states to participate in this pilot

&amp;#xb;

so it sounds like the ability to use snap via a saved card with things like scan &amp; go without having the physical card present to swipe i'm not sure how i feel about this - on one hand it seems like it would free up a lot of time in store for a lot of folks via the use of scan &amp; go to see as they go along totals etc but it also seems like a huge risk for fraud thoughts"

"reporting income projections on sale of personal items before they are actually sold - when &amp; how often in my state of nevada we are required to report a change in income within  days  that's reasonable but what threw me was the requirement to report ""projected"" income not yet received particularly if that is not coming from a predictable source like a wage 

i plan to sell personal items online but not sure what items and which website and for how much it's one thing to report these after the event when you know the dollar amounts but how are you supposed to submit a projection when the item may not sell for months or not at all  

i was told that just putting up a ""for sale"" sign online anywhere (craigslist ebay etc) counts as ""self-employment date"" with requisite ""projected income"" from the day you upload the ad to be reported as ""change of income"" when you've not received any funds which will still be used to adjust your snap  benefits  then when you don't make the money after a time and you take down the ad for not selling to report again that you did not make the said ""projected income""  the welfare advisor said even panhandlers have to submit projected income as way of example

however if you pawn an item for cash that is not counted as income in most cases according to the welfare counselor which i suppose is because its considered a loan  

and putting something on consignment has to be reported even if it may not sell  

i have health issues that keep me from going out for a regular job and am downsizing to pay my basic bills but this ""projected income"" reporting requirement seems a lot of paperwork on uncertain events and funds since it's not the same as reporting when you actually get the money or a real business with expected streams from accounts receivable  

would appreciate advise or clarification on what people are doing"
nc do you have to report new job if not over how does this work my husband's hours got cut bad so looking for new job or second job and i'm very confused by how this works in nc in part because medicaid seems to work very differently with medicaid i have to report all changes (or so i think) but with food stamps it's only if you go over i would think they would need to know the new job unless their system automatically updates them

"nj snap issues/questions i had snap benefits in atlantic county nj i moved to burlington county and was told that (despite my benefits being discontinued prior) that i had to have my still-active atlantic county case closed before i could apply in burlington county

i contacted atlantic county was never able to speak to an actual person but left countless messages asking to have my call returned it took them  months to call me back for a five minute conversation asking my case to be closed then another month for them to actually close it

i applied to burlington received the packet sent it back and just got off the phone with them (called for status update) and was told that after receiving everything back it could take another few *months* to actually receive my card benefits i asked if there was any way to get expedited benefits they said no

i read on lsnjlaw
[

&gt;if you qualify for food stamps/snap you should get them no later than  days from the date the office got your application

&gt;if your household has little or no money and needs help right away you may be eligible for expedited food stamps/snap this means that the food stamp/snap office must give you food stamps/snap within seven days of the date you apply

so - njlsw contradicts what i was told by bcss about how long it takes to receive benefits and the existence of expedited benefits

just wondering if anyone has experienced applying (in burlington county or elsewhere with a similar situation) and if their experience reflected what i was told by bcss

i'm freaking out - disabled two kids can't drive (so can't get to food pantries) and have been overdrafting my bank account every month just to buy food i'm $ in the negative with fees mounting daily and have no food i'm really at the end of my rope

any suggestions information etc would be greatly appreciated thank you

he does not currently collect food stamps and hasn’t in years he lost his job in october and is still looking  he hates asking for help but he needs to apply

got my first deposit early january it was $ in stamps initially i thought that was weird and assumed it was pro-rated from applying back in september backpay 

the only way i can justify the $k is that when i initially saw i was approved i saw it was ”approved” back in september with a renewal date in february which later updated to starting / with renewal in august the amount the math amount of months it added up and that’s why i assumed it was correct but there’s definitely an error

now i’m thinking there has to be an error in the system i got my usual deposit on the th of $ (my first deposit outside of that random $k at the beginning of the month) which is the amount that i’m to get each month which is fine and i’m more than okay with that however the next day i got another deposit which was in various deposits adding up to $ that’s not right especially with a family of  

i’m obviously going to call because there has to be an error and i’m not trying to commit fraud or get benefits that don’t belong to me i’m wondering if anything like this has happened to anyone here and what the outcome was

 this wasn’t deliberate on my part like i said i’m not trying to commit fraud has to be an error through texas hhsc and monday morning i’m calling them

receiving snap and medicaid assistance for me and my two sons now going after their father for support but he already provides support not sure what to do my kid's father owns a couple houses ( not nice ones but he uses them as rentals) so instead of child support he let's me live in one and pays the utilities for us we just got a letter saying the state is going after him for support because they get medicalhe's working at a temp agency right now and doesn't make much ( he's trying to sell his rentals because he's about to lose them to the bank we were honestly trying to work stuff out and then this hit and now i don't know what to do should i just move him in and tell the state will he have back pay he only makes $/month and they say it's $ gross
"question about the example given in table  on the fns eligibility faq page [link to the page i'm talking about]( scroll down to table : how to calculate snap gross income

for the example it states that this is for a household of "" people with no elderly or disabled members""

then it lists the gross monthly income as ""$ earned income + $ social security""

my question is this: am i missing out on a social security grouping that is not elderly or disabled if this is social security retirement income then a member of the household is over  (therefore elderly by snap's definition of elderly) if it's ssi or ssdi then a member of the household is disabled

i guess i'm curious because it's not an accurate example if that's the case since households with a member who is elderly or disabled only have to pass the net income test

--and as i'm about to hit enter i do remember there being social security survivor's benefits that can be awarded to dependents who may not be otherwise disabled or elderly so i guess that would be the case here then anyway i'll post just to clarify on that point

i am an independent contractor i work as a coach when i can but the last couple months i have been getting out of a relationship and moving and so work has been slow like $ a month average income i also have been selling personal stuff on ebay and poshmark to get a little bit of cash a friend of mine agreed to let me stay with him if i kick him $-$ every month and provide meals and clean for him he does not make much money either given that he is a friend we do not have a concrete rental agreement 

would i qualify for benefits 

if i am cooking meals for him as a form of rent does that mean i have to add him to the calfresh application 

is him just writing out a statement of facts enough for proof of residency 

do i list the ebay stuff as income even if it’s just my personal stuff i’m selling and super inconsistent

"another fraud investigation post (fl) i received a letter from dcf stating that an unidentified male has been living with me for the last year my husband and i are separated have been most of the time since  and i was receiving snap/medicaid for the kids and pregnancy medicaid for myself i never received benefits for myself as he paid child support privately instead of through child support enforcement we were trying to work it out and just recently got back together he lost his job and due my pregnancy and covid i was unable to obtain one he does have offers on the table and plans to accept one today at a pay cut i never lied about income and when i applied he wasn't living in the home he did visit our children here often as he had been couch surfing at various family and friends (we have  kids and i didn't feel comfortable with him taking them to various places many of whom i didn't know) due to covid and quarantine he has been here to help with the baby but again without income most of that time (except the  weeks of quarantine prior to her birth) he most certainly has not been living with me full time for the last year i've talked to at least  person he stayed with off and on that will write a letter attesting to this various family and friends know this

they're asking for a copy of the unidentified male's id all gross income (none) copy of last  week's paystubs (none) and his relationship to us

i can only surmise they mean my husband as no other males have stayed here for more than a few days (my little brother) in the last year 

i'm realizing i should've reported the change but didn't think much of it due to him not having an income and prior to that still only paying me child support oftentimes even less than reported i didn't need more benefits and didn't want to take more during the pandemic i had planned to report the changes when he accepted his new job 

he did help me with some bills since i haven't been able to put as much time into my business (self employed again- covid pregnancy and virtual schooling) but to be honest even most of those are behind he does get mail here and such since he never established residency anywhere else 

the paper i got states that i must contact the individual listed by // to discuss the results of my review failure to do so may result in being unable to determine my eligibility

i'm not sure what to do since i had planned to close/report changes soon anyways do i follow through what can happen i never intentionally defrauded anyone nor did i lie at the time of my application i haven't even applied since january they've just automatically extended everything due to the pandemic  help

"i can't login to see my balance i'm from pa so i use  to login but every time i've tried to do so the site says i have the wrong login information i've reset my login id and password a couple of times now and it's still not logging me in is this normal 

i thought i would receive an email about password resets but i didn't receive anything for all the times i did it

edit: i switched browsers to see if this would help still received the same error ""user name or password is incorrect"" i auto save my passwords and copy and paste them so that can't be right

edit : alright i was able to login if anyone else is curious about how i fixed my issue the first id you make is permanent i thought i had changed it but i didn't and when i finally realized this i got locked out of my account because i wasn't paying attention ended up getting logged out and had to reset my password but even then my normal browser (chrome) didn't want to log me in so i tried brave again and yea it worked 🤷

i think the big issue was chrome and time try giving the system a moment after you've reset your password before you attempt to login then use a different browser if you use chrome as your default browser on your phone like me take care ✌️"
i was unemployed for a few months getting ebt benefits but once i got a new serving job my benefits lowered hi everyone i live in la and as you know the cost of living is high here i was doing gig work here and there the last two months to pay rent and it wasn’t much but i heavily relied on my ebt card for food ($ monthly) but once i got hired as a server for $/hr the benefits went from $ to now $/month is this normal
"last paycheck/vacation payout too large to receive first month of benefits (ca) hi everyone

i lost my job yesterday (august ) and applied for food stamps right away (los angeles county) i had my phone interview today and was approved but the caseworker told me that i wouldn’t be receiving my allowance ($) for the month of august because my last paycheck was above the maximum income level

my issue: my last paycheck included not only my last wages but also had my unused vacation time payout 

i checked the calfresh website and saw that my last paycheck (wages only) was more than the ""% federal poverty level maximum gross income allowed"" but less than the ""gross monthly income eligibility standards for modified categorical eligibility (mce)/broad-based categorical eligibility (bbce) % federal poverty level maximum gross income allowed"" ([per the calfresh eligibility criteria]( 

my question: **what exactly is mce/bcce** and why don’t i qualify for it is it because of the supplemental (vacation payout) that’s on my last paycheck is it standard for unused vacation time to be counted towards income/eligibility

thank you so much for your help"

appealing/am i still eligible so i have been receiving food stamps in california for over  months now (i think i started in september of  i can’t remember exact date though) in early march i believe i had to report my income at this point in time i was making just above the income limit for food stamps last week i received a letter in the mail stating i would no longer be receiving benefits starting may st and that i could appeal if i thought this was wrong as of march rd i lost my second job so i have not been making over the income limit since then(although i had already filed my income which was over the limit before i was let go) i called the appeals office and now need to send paystubs/letter of termination/how much i pay in rent/utilities etc however i have a dilemma my family is being bought out of our apartment a few weeks ago i received a check of $k for this i’m wondering if this counts as income and if it would affect my eligibility for food stamps i have around k in savings now because of this if i didn’t appeal and just let them cut my benefits and then reapplied later (still having this money in my savings) would it make me eligible again vs if i appeal now i am also paying less in rent than i was when i applied about $ less i’m sorry if this is confusing thank you
fl temporary work out of state reporting requirements my husband was laid off last week (though he's union and will likely be back at work next week) but was given the opportunity to work in ny for  weeks during the summer we are from there and were planning on visiting for a week but if we can work and make extra money we can stay the  weeks until the kids go back to school but how will this work for snap reporting he will probably get unemployment until/unless his union gives him another job before we would leave in a month but i wasn't planning on reporting the decrease in income yet since it hopefully will only last a week (as it usually does) if he does transfer to ny for the summer and then back to fl at the end (same union/work) i'm not sure how or when to report any of that information and don't want to screw anything up i assume his ny wage will make us ineligible income wise here in fl but i'm really just unsure how it should all work and getting anyone on the phone is not easy it's also not definite we're going yet as we still have some logistics to work out just trying to get ahead of myself and figure out my next steps

well i was waiting for over a week for a new ebt card to come because i have a pretty decent amount of food benefits that have been loaded to my account and obviously the card i had was disabled due to everything nothing comes so i call the county and they tell me nothing was ever issued and that they'll put in a request and i should be getting a call if approved so i can pick it up in office (why tf wouldn't i be approved) i wait no call

 weekend comes and goes and so i call again on monday and the guy says he's so so sorry and how they really dropped the ball because nothing was ever put in for me to get a call/ebt etc and that he will absolutely get right on that blah blah and i'll be getting a call the next day (tuesday) and he apologizes again and reassures me it'll be sorted

yeah no call it's wednesday now and i've about $ left on our pebt which thank goodness we remembered we had otherwise we would've been so royally screwed i'm gonna call yet again tomorrow (would've today but i'm super sick and was up til :am with a fever and massive ear ache) and see wtf is going on down there that it's so hard to get me a new damn ebt oh and i should add that i called the ebt vendor to send one out in between the two calls to the county and they said one was already issued by the county (the county says no nothing was issued 🙄😒) so they can't send one

i am beyond frustrated"

i don't think we qualify for snap and i was looking into local food pantries but i'm not sure if we qualify for those programs either in particular i read about a program by loaves and fishes that offers groceries once a month if your household makes below  grand a year my fiancee thinks we still won't qualify because he had a summer internship that paid $ an hour for a few months but because of student loans and paying for my classes we only have about $ in the bank and it depletes every month because i'm not making enough to cover all our expenses

the biggest issues we face in terms of buying groceries is that we can just get ramen and call it a day because he has celiac's disease and i have very bad ibs that restricts me to a vegan diet

"trying to get food stamps in louisiana as a graduate student i've been in a bit of a rough patch and figured it was time that i applied for some food stamps i sent in the application and just completed my interview she verified all my information and it looks like things are going well

my friend whos is also poor and gets food stamps persuaded me to download a few apps that give you points/money back when you scan your grocery receipts

i got $ in  months from fetch rewards and im about to get $ more i was able to buy laundry detergent shampoo deodorantetc and because i get food stamps this isnt costing me anything im basically getting free money back

i only got $ on ibotta and almost $ on reciept pal so theyre not as good but its still free money that i definitely could use right now 


you get $ when you sign up and scan your first receipt with these codes:

fetch rewards- qw


ibotta - xtmrdxo


and for recipet pal i think you start of with bonus points and get more points when you verify your account and connect to amazon 

receipt pal download link - 



again this is a great way to save money/earn money if you're really strapped even if you don't get food stamps"

this is what the paper says : 

""if you submit this form by // and are still eligible your snap benefits will continue without delay

if we do not receive the complete periodic report we will stop your snap benefits on //""



so does that mean that if i don't submit it until the end of july i'll still get all of the food stamps for july that's what i'm really worried about since my partner is only taking that month off before going back to work


also since i won't meet the requirements by that time will i have to wait a long time before applying again after i start working

compared to working on my disability claim and unemployment with the edd getting calfresh was a breeze their online application system is simple intuitive and quick my case worker is pleasant and i didn't feel judged for applying

i’m not sure if this post has been made before my apologies if it has

the quickest way to find out is to search the product label look for the nutrition facts label block that’s all you need to find to know whether it’s covered that means it’s considered food

if something has a ‘supplement facts’ label instead  you will have to use your own cash to cover it as supplements are considered optional and therefore not food"

help to fight hello all hopefully someone can be of assistance with information for the state of fl (hillsborough county) i have a family member whom is using snap benefits however she is now being looked at for fraud due to her case worker misinterpreting information that was provided when asking questions the first initial thing she wanted to know was what she needed to do if she wanted to add her mother secondly she also also wanted to know about her paperwork that she listed her information on just in case she needed to make changes problem is the caseworker was never available via phone nor through office availability my family member stated that when she was finally able to renew it was a day late and that the call with then caseworker lasted only  minutes soon after the case worker called and said that she would be reporting her for fraud and that she submitted the case this has caused a problem bc my family member needed didn't get to ask all of the information in the first place dcf has also called and harassed her too stating that the fraud team will be in touch bc she didn't list her veteran income which is something i didn't even know my family member didn't know this either and is upset and feels blindsided as she was trying to communicate with a unwilling case worker about all the required information that a veteran needs to include question is what does she need to do and how does she fight this

"questions about food stamps hi there i actually just applied for food stamps literally  mins ago because it was being promoted by my college i currently live on my own first year in college i work + hours a week and if i’m being honest i’ve been the one paying my tuition fees even though my parents claimed they would i typically save my money for transportation purposes and rent and that’s pretty much it i have a roommate but she gets money from her parents and she basically eats her food and i eat my food lately moneys been scarce and i’ve been doordashing a lot because i frankly don’t have the time energy and motivation to grocery shop especially being a full time college student i need to devote like … hours to studying while also going back to campus in person i either eat doordash or skip two out of the three meals all together or eat an orange for dinner and call it a day 
im just wondering if applying for food stamps will affect my taxes will i qualify for less money when i do my taxes for next year were any of you guys ashamed applying for it does my employer need to know about it will it affect me negatively in any way is an ebt card basically a credit card do i need to pay it back in the long run or is it actually a grant will it affect my credit in any way does it affect my schooling i’m just skeptical and i’m too afraid to ask my parents because they’ll say they’ll “help me out” but then bail on their promises and say that their money is “tight…” 
let me know thanks you guys &lt;"

&amp;#xb;

my question is do i have to report such a small amount of income and how do i go about it

&amp;#xb;

for example the report this month from ebay says i sold  shoes and my total sales were $ but my net was $ after fees shipping and taxes were taken out but in reality my profit was more like around $ after you account for the cost of buying the shoe along with shipping and taxes it's not really a business as i am not buying and selling in large volumes it's just pocket change for the most part 

how do you report that do i report my gross or what i actually profited if i show proof of my ebay report for the month and it says i netted $ it would be disingenuous because in reality i made way less i know regardless it's not over the threshold of a  person household but how do i do this without my earnings seeming inflated

&amp;#xb;

do i have to report it under since i'm buying and selling:

""did anyone: get buy sell trade or give away any property land homes cars bank accounts money payments (such as lottery/casino winnings back benefits from social security) or other property items since last reported""

&amp;#xb;

any help would be appreciated thanks"

if you recently received an ebt card in the mail without knowledge of why it is because one of your children in school receive free or reduced lunches 

you should have $ for each child if you don't contact your local office

if you are having trouble setting your pin it is most likely because the date of birth is not yours the p-ebt cards will come in the parents name and the oldest child's date of birth (oldest child that's **still in school**)

i get the letter that my benefits will end on // due to my income being too high so i call leave a message and they return my call they say that my income is too high at $/week i was confused about the $ boost counting against snap income because the bill had just passed so i didn't question it 

and then after all of this i only received the original amount of $/month for january and never received the % increase nor the maximum amount increase for january

"or snap asset limit i recently moved from ca to or and applied for snap benefits as i was eligible for them in ca and had no issues there but following an initial phone interview i’m looking into the eligibility requirements for oregon and i’m concerned by how much value they put on assets and resources ca never asked about the type of car i have &amp; whether or not i own it additionally they didn’t ask about my savings k and  college fund balances either it was simply a matter of my monthly income
i meet the income requirements for a household of  in or but i’m concerned my other account balances may disqualify me from receiving benefits so i guess my question is does anyone know how much importance is actually put on assets when determining eligibility in or additionally i didn’t have access to exact amounts when i was giving the interview (i was at work) and i guessed offhandedly (everything is taken out and put into the various accounts off the top which are at different institutions than my main bank so it’s not something i see unless i’m specifically looking into it) they didn’t ask for further paperwork to verify these amounts as i thought they might but i know they use a system that can pull current balances for medicaid applications is that same system used for snap i’m not trying to be denied for misrepresenting assets because i guessed balances rather than taking time to check exact amounts 
apologies if this seems silly the woman who i spoke to on the phone seemed so much more serious &amp; invested in exact figures &amp; details (like the make/model/year of my car) than my case worker in ca and gave me anxiety with the way she read the disclaimers about how one presents their information (i get similar anxiety every year filing my taxes government agencies stress me out)

our household snap assistance also ended at the same time i was never asked to renew and in fact was automatically renewed at some point 

however i just received a notice in the mail saying i was overpaid by % between july  and march  (meaning i was not supposed to receive any snap assistance) and they are requesting repayment in the full amount of nearly $k

does anyone know why this might be they say because we failed to report a change in income this is not true in fact the only change in our household income was in september  (as mentioned above) where my then husband also became unemployed

the pandemic had completely fucked us over we are now divorced and living with our parents again unable to attain the same sort of employment we used to have (meaning our individual and combined incomes are now less than % of what we used to make) there is no way i can afford to repay this

is the reason my americorps stipend was disregarded because () i was receiving medicaid prior to applying for snap or () they made a mistake on counting my income i just want to make sure i can actually use my benefits before they tell me to pay it all back tia"

i’m a california resident and student

approved for calfresh on march

my irt is $

i’m unsure how my irt is that much since i’m a full-time student ( units) unemployed (for about  months) and have no living expenses atm 
my question: should my irt be that high

another question why not:

i’ve asked (during my phone interview) if they can offer more help to students with a learning disability and i didn’t hear back about that

second question: can i qualify for disability 

i’ve had a learning disability since i was in elementary i joined iep  since then and have applied in college as well"

what steps to take if needed documentation cannot be obtained in louisiana my so and i are both out of work due to covid and are out of money/food so i tried to apply for snap i did not get a phone interview but got an email saying i needed to meet certain requirements i did all of them that i could but they want a notice of separation/last paycheck form filled out by my bf's last employer (mcdonald's) that has to be filled out and signed by his previous manager the lobbies of restaurants are closed and are drive thru only they will not take the paper through the window due to health and contamination concerns the manager in question had some health issues so likely isn't even coming into work right now i can't get the manager on the phone i emailed dcfs to ask what to do and they basically told me that if i couldn't provide that paper then my case could not be processed how can that be right it's not my fault that they won't cooperate and me continually going up to the store to clog up the drive thru and try and get this paper filled out is risking my health and wasting gas i am pregnant and not comfortable going there anymore what can i do
"dependents question &amp; self-employed business assets question **question **:
how do i count dependents i'm divorced now remarried my ex and i share joint custody of our teen child our child stays with me half the week the other half with mom my ex-wife claims our child on her taxes would i still count my child as  dependent 


also my current wife resigned from her job at the beginning of  to finish her degree and has been unemployed since i count her as a dependent right  what should my total household count be



**question **: 
i am self employed (sole proprietorship) do i need to include my separate business checking account as cash on hand assets *also business vehicle is paid off and in my name


aside from a personal checking that we use to pay monthly bills and a less than desireable savings account (probably only enough to survive for  months) we really don't have much   *i'm guessing my wife's (~k) retirement account doesn't count right


[**bonus question**: are they looking mainly at regular monthly income or does cash on hand make a huge difference in the decision for eligibility/approval  


before this global health issue i took out a personal loan (k) to go on a family trip since the whole world shut down i didn't get a chance to use that k loan it's now just sitting there-- and i'm stuck between deciding to use it to survive the economic downfall or just payback the loan so its no longer ""on-hand""  considering my wife may not be able to quickly find a job when she graduates in a few months i'm really leaning towards holding on to the personal loan as survival money]  


any advice is greatly appreciated thank you

i tried this twice before calling customer service the rep said that they cannot set up the pin over the phone it’s possible the system is just down but if i try three times and it doesn’t work i will be locked out of my account

"does money in checking account affect calfresh eligibility \[**los angeles california**\]

i applied for calfresh for my parents who are retired they live in los angeles california my mom is  and has no income and my dad is  and his only income is from social security retirement which is around  i did the interview already and it got approved however my parents have heard from other people that having a certain amount in bank accounts/retirement accounts can disqualify you for calfresh they do have money in a checking account and they have an ira account i looked up the eligibility rules and i believe they are eligible but i am a bit confused about this section

&gt;which households are subject to the resource limit  
&gt;  
&gt;resources are counted *only for those households that* :  
&gt;  
&gt;*contain a member who has been disqualified from participating in calfresh because of an intentional program violation*  
&gt;  
&gt;*have a head of household does not comply with* [*work requirements*](  
&gt;  
&gt;*have any member of the household has been convicted of certain categories of drug felonies*  
&gt;  
&gt;what is the resource limit for those households  
&gt;  
&gt;households that fit one of the three descriptions above are subject to a resource limit of $ **if they also have a member who has a disability or who is  years of age or older the resource limit is $** any countable resource will be added to the household's resource limit when making an eligibility determination

if i receive it but our income doesn't surpass the gross limit for our household that month and it's not a recertification period should i be reporting it when i receive it anyway the letters we receive about eligibility says to report changes to income if it exceeds the gross limit

related to that--as a household with disabled members where the gross limit test doesn't apply during recertification do i still report if the income on a month exceeds the gross limit that hasn't happened yet; it might with an arrearage payment though but i've wondered about in general too"

"illinois snap benefits going down (please help) providing as little personal information as possible my household consists of  people my mother sister nephew and myself everyone minus my nephew is over the age of 

we've been on snap for over  years now and my mother is the sole income she receives snap income on all of our behalf under her account

she just got laid off from her job in may and is now receiving around $ every  weeks from employment

we were due for our yearly snap redetermination and filled out all of the information as we are used to doing the only thing different is that we stated the job change and stated the income from unemployment our household income went down by about $ since our last years redetermination due to the job loss so we figured snap would actually increase instead snap has decreased

starting next month we will now receive $ instead of $ they state the reason why is that ""the household income has changed"" and ""&lt;me&gt; is not eligible for snap benefits""

i am unsure of what to do since i am unsure of why i would suddenly not be eligible for snap while everyone else is nothing has changed in terms of my income (of which is there is none) or expenses in the section marked ""reason:"" next to my name as to why i am not eligible it is left entirely blank so i am not even sure what to try to attempt to fix

i seek any and all advice regarding this - i'm not sure if i should head down to the office and see if they can do anything there or if i should attempt to do something from online this is really scary and important as we're just barely meeting our bills and food as it is now all while my mother is on employment rough year for sure

my application was denied because my wages ""did not have insurance social security etc"" taken out of the check  (per the hhs operator)  again i'm a contractor these are the same format of wages i submitted the first time  she said re-submit with a note saying that so i did on / (letter said they would re-eval by /)  nothing  call again the operator told me the notes clearly state that i was missing the information but she can clearly see the information is there so she moves it up for re-eval again  again i wait  

today i call because it's clearly another month and the operator tells me it was closed this morning because it had been sitting there for so long  what in the actual ffffff  i'm so pissed  i filed an appeal but now i'm  months behind on food stamps  i lost both my ""new"" jobs last week literally both of them unemployment hasn't paid out since july and that's another uphill battle to face butany other contractors face this what fixed it it blows my mind that they can't read a pay stub  have they disqualified everyone who's a contractor craziness :-("

would i be able to attain snap once i graduated high school even if i'm still  how would i show that i'm being charged rent and paying bills even though there's no contract or paper copy of it and that i wouldn't be able to get a contract if one was required of me would it matter that i'm still living with my parent even if i'm paying rent and if i were to apply as essentially a tenant in this home would i have to provide the income of my mother

i know this is all a couple of months away but i feel so lost my mother has made some very bad financial choices in the past that affects all of us moving away isn't an option because there would be no one to take care of her or my grandma

not everyone in my household shared or made the same amount of money as one another etc so someone mentioned doing separate household as an option (social worker and/or aquaintance)

she doesn’t want to lose benefits or do anything wrong and is definitely not on snap for life she’s not an online product reseller and is not a professional pet sitter but i did say she should look into both of these as possible self-employment activities"

during this hectic time to my surprise i got duplicate assistance for  month i didn't realize i got the duplicate assistance because i wasn't checking my other ebt card i just spent the money on my  kids and me

that was in september of  since i've been getting ""paris contact"" letters every  months (these are letters saying i got assistance in  states at once and i need to prove my  kids and i live in state  only) i've been getting these for  / year every  months and send proof we live here

"privacy when using ebt cards in store (point of sale ebt card reader) question for grocery store clerks/managers/owners:

 during checkout at large grocery stores when an snap/ ebt card holder swipes their ebt card and punches their pin number does the name of the ebt card holder appear on any of the clerk's screens or anywhere else
 at some smaller grocery stores ( think lil mom and pop store) i noticed that the pos credit/debit card reader ( swipe or chip) won't read the ebt card a shopper may have to physically hand their ebt card to the clerk who would then swipe the card into an alternate card reader after that they clerk would request the shopper/ebt card holder to enter their pin number 
 *the concern with the process in the above # is that the clerk now has access to the physical ebt card and can glance at the card holder's full name/identity is there anyway to avoid this/or a way around this for ebt card holders who would like privacy for ebt card holders who don't want store owners to know that they are on ebt*

i didn't report unearned income on my application i last received unearned income in march but when i was applying i was no longer receiving unearned income as that terminated with my last payment in march did i have to report this

i'm a recent  year old college grad who just moved back home when i applied i was in the midst of moving out of my dorm so i used my parents address (same state) where i had planned on moving to in the near future and wanted them to send the card to however i did not include them in my household as i am an adult and wasn't living with them at time of application do i have to include them just because we live under the same roof even if i prepare my meals separately 

i am currently receiving unemployment in may but have only received $ it says i have to report the change  days after the end of the month i receive income over $ which i certainly plan on doing however since my next payment won't be until the month of june does that mean i have until july  to report and thus can receive benefits until then in the month of june i will probably have $ in unemployment benefits which will make me ineligible (or at least they would reduce my amount substantially) i was also supposed to have received retroactive payments since april but they probably won't come until at least june

"snap update // - what does the end of the govt shutdown mean for food stamps hey y'all

~~i'm speculating without any direct guidance from fns but based on what we saw recently here's what i believe the end of the government shutdown means for the program for the next few months~~:

edit // @ : est: i was able to confirm via fns that the following information is true fns is also concerned about the + lag in benefits for some participants and is weighing possible options

edit // @ : est: q&amp;a from fns: 

* the three week continuing resolution (cr) ends on february 

* all february benefits are guaranteed (ongoing cases should have received theirs as early issuance in january-- **households that received early issuance will not receive more benefits in february without some sort of fns intervention**)

* this means that any financial obligations owed by the government (such as food stamp benefits and admin dollars) can be paid out for the  days following the (cr) or until **march  **

* therefore march food stamp benefits should be guaranteed and paid out as normal

* ~~if there is *another* government shutdown following this cr then april benefits could be paid out by march  as early issuance~~ another shutdown was averted and an appropriations bill was passed that is good through the rest of the federal fiscal year (until october )

**upshot** ~~i believe fns will confirm next week that~~ march/april benefits will be guaranteed for ongoing cases and recertifications that are processed before march "

"clarification on the procedure post interview i am so frustrated i don’t know how anyone gets snap benefits with the hoops they make you jump through and the little information they give you and extremely difficult procedures 

i had my “phone interview “ and she told me that i’ll have to send in my proof of loss of income and pay stubs for december as well as go down to the career source office and they’ll help me along with what i’m supposed to do there and then email snap when i’ve completed that 

so of course after trying to call career source several times today to make sure that it’ll be the right location/correct thing to do and it going to voice mail each time i decided to drive the  miles to see them in person since i’m out of my job and at least i have that kind of time now 

when i got there they told me i’m not even supposed to come see them until after i’m approved but that’s not what the lady on the interview said the careersource people told me that they can’t even do anything for me as i’m simply shown as “pending “ i was literally crying on my way out

"all of my money was stolen from me  minutes after it was loaded maybe this isn't the place for this but i just needed to vent i get $ in cash assistance a month plus  something in calfresh benefits every th i checked my balance after getting home yesterday to be sure it was on there for me fiancé to take off and put towards rent and it said i have $ obviously i started freaking tf out 

i called the card and it said the same i checked the website again for transaction history and saw a bunch of ivr balance inq which i'm guessing is someone checking my card starting on the th of april then i see at :am $ was withdrawn from us bank in san francisco (i live in the central valley here in ca about  or so hours away)

i called the county and the woman was very uncaring and cold said i need to file a police report fill out papers she'd send me and that it would take up to  days she said she was gonna cancel the card and i'd need to get a new one issued i then realized i'm set to get my food benefits on said card on the th and kind of freak out a bit i ask if we can hold off until after i go shopping because i have two kids to feed she says she has to it's procedure i ask how i'm supposed to feed my kids and if she can please please just wait she says no it's procedure i'm on the verge of tears at this point and tbh just frustrated at her lack of caring and i tell her ok just go ahead and do your job and cancel it and we get off the phone 

so i filed a report with sfpd since the crime took place there and technically is out of my cities jurisdiction from what i understand called the ebt hotline to report it as well in which the lady hung up (intentionally or not i have no idea) on me about mins into the call hoping she got all the info she needed tried calling back but it asks for my card number and when i enter it says the card has been disabled and hangs up basically

so yeah apparently this is happening a lot nowadays and welfare basically shrugs their shoulders and is in no rush to provide aid emergency or otherwise to people who fall victim to this 

i just needed to vent to other people who can understand just how horrible this would feel i sobbed into a pillow for a few minutes after that first initial phone call luckily my fiancé is able to cover rent but there are gonna be a lot of people this happens to who have nothing else to fall back onto"

"“nutrition facts” not ebt eligible hi all i’m in california and tried to use my ebt card to purchase an item at walmart with “nutrition facts” on the label but it rang up as not ebt eligible i’ve bought this product before at this same store with my food stamps but now it wasn’t working the walmart employee says i have to contact ebt about it but the phone number on the back of the card is an automated service and my county office is closed

it’s a box of kinderlyte electrolyte powder so i can see how it could be a supplement but it says nutrition and i’ve bought it before so i’m confused this is a necessary item recommended by my doctor that i need more of today so i’m at a loss for who to contact or what’s going on due to the item being eligible in the past thanks for any thoughts"
"calfresh we were given allotment &amp; card was also supposed to be loaded but funds were revoked my brother’s ebt card was given the allotment (we checked the balance this past sunday morning) of $ his monthly “regular ebt” gets loaded every th of the month when we checked the balance on sunday  they also informed us of him receiving his monthly as a future pending amount of $—which was supposed to be loaded yesterday 

well today i went to carls jr to get my dad some food &amp; the card declined  times i figured it was their payment system so i called the card to check the balance  just to be sure it wasn’t us  &amp; the balance was actually $ 

no one has used this ebt card since we last checked the balance &amp; were told the balance was $ i know this for a fact  because the card has been in my possession since then so  no one could’ve stolen it 

any idea as to why his balance is showing $

i have my own ebt card &amp; my card is perfectly fine i received the allotment &amp; the monthly reload (i get mine on the th as well) i’ve purchased groceries since sunday without any issues 

my brother says he never received anything in the mail to recertify or anything  but it’s not even time for that 

my thing is  he actually had the allotment of $ &amp; somehow  that’s been revoked for some reason he never even received his monthly reload 

what should we do



update: i just checked the transactions &amp; somebody took almost $ worth of snap food benefits from us idk how they hacked it 

also— my brother only gets food  not cashaid"

"when/how does an overpayment get found out i'm pretty sure food stamps overpaid me my caseworker even told me so but i couldn't tell if she was going to rat me out or let it slide but now i'm feeling antsy not knowing if they're going to charge me or not when/how do they find this out

i live in colorado for reference also i heard that after a year they may just waive it is this true

i have ~$ in my bank account  income of any type no job lined up (ill start putting in applications today) i haven't had foodstamps since i was a homeless drug addict in new mexico - ~ years ago i dont really know how government assistance as a whole works the only time i ever had it i was so strung out i didnt remember the application process even a week later also i think it was non standard as i didnt have any form of id at the time

there are  people in my home (i live in an oxford house) these people have no relation to me no obligation to help me in any way nor would i want to ask them to do so also regarding the va benefit eligibility checks i don't even know how old most of them are do i need to list these people will the fact that there are so many people in my home affect my eligibility like i said we're not related or anything

is the fact that i have $ in my bank going to be a problem with rent car payments insurance bills etc $ can be gone in the blink of an eye frfr"

"how to report parent temporarily paying my rent on sar  (calfresh) sorry if this is long
so my sar  is due this month i moved out of my parent’s home about a month and a half ago i originally wasn’t sure if i was going to stay at this new place so i hadn’t updated my address yet 

my parent offered to help out with rent for the first couple of months to get me out of the not great situation i was in at my previous residence (long story) i haven’t been employed recently bc bad depression but have started looking for a job were i moved to 

how should i report this on the form 

so far the rent and deposit have been paid with a mix of cashiers check and personal checks personal checks being money that got transferred to me cashiers check being from parent’s account directly 

i really hope i haven’t messed up getting my benefits"

has anyone dealt with this or have any tips on what to do is there any way to get a new case worker i understand they may be very busy but i have no car am disabled and don’t really have anyone to rely on to take me to a food shelter if needed i quadruple checked and i do qualify for benefits there’s absolutely no doubt"

"cal fresh benefits taken away hi guys i'm on unemployment and received a letter from calfresh saying that my benefits have been reduced from $ a month to $ i called and the representative told me that they thought my unemployment ran out and then they realized that i was still receiving it and i make too much on unemployment to receive more than $ from my food stamps he said technically i should have to pay it back but they are being nice and aren't going to ask for the money back

what the heck how is that possible that they made this mistake then decided to ""be nice to me"" and just the fact that im on unemployment and don't qualify for more than $ of food stamps

"north carolina--what happens after approval i saw on the north carolina food stamps website that we were approved shortly after case worker got all our documents that was last week haven't received anything in the mail since then and no info other than ""approved"" is on the website application was submitted november th my ending ssn says benefits would on th of the month do you get a letter do you get a package with a card is it too soon and everything will roll out january th instead just anxious"
"(virginia) told i was approved for my snap renewal then got nothing after submitting a renewal application in early november i had a interview over the phone where the case worker told me i was approved she said she would email me if there was any issues fast forward to the first week of december and there is nothing on my card i give it a few days thinking there might be some sort of hold up but nothing was on my card i called social services to see what was going on and to my surprise i was told over the phone that my case had been closed 

i called back the case worker who dealt with my case to see what was going on and after verifying that i was a student taking classes she said that i was not eligible since i did not meet the exemptions for a student the case worker also said that i would have been eligible if i was not a student and not working this confused me because during the interview in november she said that policies were being relaxed due to the pandemic and mentioned nothing about students still being held to the same rules she even said that i was in good standing despite being a student during that interview in november

at this point i feel misled lied to and have no idea what to do it's not right that she kept me under the assumption that i was approved but did not contact me to correct the misinformation until i had to call to find out why my snap balance didn't refill in december if the case worker had her information right in the first place this would not be an issue is there anything i can do also are students still being held to the normal standards despite the pandemic"

i was called back with in a couple of hours and the lady was very helpful and assisted in processing the necessary changes she had to finish and update a few things and said she would call me back again with an update

my question is what can i do i assume i could apply for unemployment but what about food stamps i was reading that college students are only eligible if they work an average of  hours per week (which obviously i wouldn't be when i get laid off next month) i assume they have a reason for that but it sounds like losing my job will disqualify me from food stamp eligibility is that correct what else can i do to help myself get through this  obviously getting another job is the ideal goal but i just want to make sure i'll be okay if i can't find one within a month

"food stamps delayed in el paso county co someone suggested i post this here

location: el paso county colorado usa

quick  backstory: we have been on food stamps for a few years  the army got  my (now) ex husband hooked on oxy and he had a total mental breakdown  and left our family basically homeless  we went on assistance

how  it works here:  you apply for benefits  you have to prove you're a  citizen  you give them a ton of documents  you have to work to receive  food stamps  about every  months you have to ""recertify"" ie you  have to prove your situation is the same and you still need food stamps   i have had issues in the past when i didn't recertify on time but  they always fixed it in a reasonable amount of time  i don't like their  system but it was always my fault in the past when i didn't get them on  time

when i recertified i  noticed the website was somewhat different  what was troubling was that  some of my information was wrong most notably that my daughter was now  listed as a non-us citizen  they have all her documents they know she  is a citizen

they also made me prove my son is still in high school  they didn't do that with my daughters

i  also noticed that changes i made months ago were ""under review""  (actually they are still under review) meaning no one has so much as  opened my file since last summer

i  didn't get my fs by the beginning of december  i went on a local fb  group and asked if anyone knew what was going on they said the news did  a segment on the situation  they said the office is ""short staffed""   but several people said that they also recertified and still  no  benefits  people suggested i call or go to the office  i called them   i had been on hold for + hours when i had to go to class  i called  them  times same result  finally i called them and waited three hours  (i was told i would have to wait that long) someone finally - after  three hours on hold - answered the phone  i talked to them for   minutes  they said they would put in a ticket  that was about  weeks  ago

last week they texted me  that i would have my recertification interview (yes they do phone  interviews) to determine whether we are eligible  normally it is a   minute conversation this interview lasted  minutes and they asked me  so many questions  normally they will give me the fs stamps within   hours of the interview  i still do not have my fs several days  later

oh  lol  and lucky i  received the text because the letter they always send to inform you of  the interview was put in my mailbox an hour after the time of the  interview  it took  days to send that letter about  miles across  town"

no one else in the house is receiving any financial help 

i’m not sure what they look at if they see other household members and their income and if it affects my eligibility but on paper it just appears as though i am unemployed with no income i guess i do also have an onlyfans but it makes me maybe $-$ a month on average i stopped doing it because we only needed it while we were living in my car but people still sub even tho they can see i haven’t posted since november but idk how long that will keep up or if it even matters

he is being medically discharged from the military for losing his leg and will also lose his job because you must be active duty for it

would it be considered emergency assistance at the time because yes he had paystubs showing he made money but will not be making money soon and we already don't have money for groceries because of inflation we go to three different food banks in our area a month when we can

i made my next appointment and at some point during it we were all told that if we've received a sanction it'll be lifted if you start cooperating the only thing i was sanction for (to my knowledge) was missing my appointment - and since i made that before the end of the month my sanction should've been lifted also the day before this appointment i filed a change of income form because my boyfriend lost his job i can't work because of debilitating anxiety so that meant that we had no income

a week later i realize my sanction wasn't lifted so i emailed my case worker (it's the second week of the month at this point) and i'm basically just like ""what's going on why isn't it lifted is there something i missed""

she never e-mailed me back it took me two weeks to realize that i hadn't heard from her (my memory is god-awful) so i emailed her again - and then i called the office the next day they sent me to voicemail i could not get through to anyone i still have not heard from my case worker either

they also haven't processed the change of income form yet and this all means that i did not get my portion of our benefits my boyfriend got his but since i'm the one responsible for going to appointments my benefits were cut off also this means that if i get sanctioned again i'll lose benefits for ***three*** months the sanction should've been lifted by now - but because of their inability to answer my e-mails and return my calls we're in deep shit 

i don't know what to do to my knowledge there's no way for them to get me my portion of our benefits at this point and even if there was they're not responding to me does anyone have any suggestions"

thanks in advance y'all"

i was accepted into the grad program at my college and was able to get on food stamps in my state but last minute i needed to take the trimester off i will be returning to the grad program in march will this effect my snap benefit status at all

i was told that every  months they do a check in to see if your income has changed and i will be in my grad program when they call/email/mail again 

i have a paper that’s titled “reporting food assistance changes” and all it says is that if we win the lottery our gross income goes over $ or if the following person(s) stops working we need to report the changes 

do i contact someone how will this effect me should i report this i haven’t spent any of the money out of fear 

more context: i live in low income housing (i am a full time student and my boyfriend is not a student that is how we qualify he also is on medicaid) i am  my parents still claim me and i don’t work because of school our income is $ a month and a “gift” of $ from friends and family rent is $"

"advice or info for my father's ebt situation please    hi my  year old father is brain damaged he had a traumatic brain injury from a burst aneurysm  years ago which resulted in  brain surgeries &amp; having a shunt implanted in his head to drain fluid as a result he has seizures lost most vision in one eye due to nerve damage from the tbi almost no short term memory loss in much long term memory &amp; other issues related to these things he cannot drive live alone or work he cannot balance money or do most simple things he can make his own food &amp; do simple chores he had open heart surgery last year &amp; other minor health issues 

  as a result he has lived with me for many years after the death of his mother who was his previous caretaker my husband &amp; i have a comfortable income but are not rich my dad gets ssi about $ monthly he gets help with prescription coverage &amp; medicaid which covers % % is not a lot when he has endless visits to doctors procedures etc if he were alone there is no way he could afford to live on his disability check we supplement his income as much as we can 

  we lived in maryland for a few years &amp; applied for ebt for him for the first time we count him as independent from our income food etc we do not charge him a specific amount of rent we just deposit his check &amp; take care of what he needs when we filled out the form for maryland ebt we put that we charge him $ rent but he also helps with utilities i was told later they only count the rent amount (not sure if this is true) not utilities medical bills &amp; other expenses they gave him $ a month 

  a few months ago we moved to florida i recently applied for him to receive medicaid &amp; ebt in florida this time i put that his rent was $ i just added the utilities all together they gave him $ a month i do not understand how this works can i dispute this or do anything to change it i thought this was decided by income he does not make enough to eat on with what he gets from the government i'm not one who would take advantage of help that others really need but he can do nothing to help himself i thought the point of ebt is to help people who are very low income is this usually only given to people with children any advice or info is appreciated thank you (edited to $ monthly i thought it was $ which was also on the letter but must be for a half month also added that he eats separately)"

"a moratorium on questions that are beyond our scope to answer over the last couple of weeks the sub has gotten flooded with questions only tangentially related to the snap program public assistance is difficult sometimes to navigate: we get it**but**a large number of these questions are about subjects that aren't something anyone here can answer  examples:

*i am still waiting on ___ dae have this problem*

this is very low-effort we can tell you  if we know what the policy is about why information is needed or help you figure out what to do about a delay is service delivery we might even be able to help you connect with the agency you're working with if you're getting frustratedbut those answers are going to have to come from the agency  they're the ones holding the reins 

*my ebt card doesn't work at this retailer in this specific location anybody know why*

the answer to this is almost certainly one of two things : either your account doesn't have the balance you think it does and it's getting rejected for insufficient funds or there is a problem with either the retailer's ebt processing or with the ebt system in that area in general neither possibility is something that we're in a position to help with

*i haven't gotten the pebt card/funds and my friend got theirs*

pebt is functionally identical to snap at the user end but it's a completely separate program with different requirements criteria and funding stream that is administered at a local level by agencies whose waivers on implementation vary by school district saying we have no idea is a gross understatement 

we may be able to tell you when funds are coming or if they're comingbut this is the main thing we're seeing over the last couple of weeks that i alluded to above as an adjacent program pebt is a parallel track to snap that uses a lot of the same infrastructure underneath

we're going to be modifying the sub rules and automod responses to give better answers as well as point people towards resources and the faq will get updated as soon as we're able 

we're open to discussion on this  so feel free to push back if you disagree or have some suggestions"

"rules update: soliciting or offering personally identifiable information good morning or evening or whatever time of day it is where you are  :)

this isn't a new concern but it's come up from time to time and the other mods and i felt it was appropriate to clarify update the rules and explain to the community what the change is and why it's being made

a core concept with working in a human services capacity is the adherence at all times to a high ethical standard and protecting personally identifiable information from misuse  

in the sidebar it says ""all program experts participating are doing so in their private capacity - no advice given here should be construed as speaking on behalf of any federal state or local agency""  the reason this is there is because reddit is not an official channel for information to get from agency to customer or vice versa - it's anonymous and needs to stay that way

if you have questions you should never under any circumstances provide your personally identifiable information to someone on reddit this puts you in a compromised position and opens you up to the possibility of having that information misused stolen or otherwise compromisedand you should be aware that there is a growing ""recovery scam"" where scammers will ask for your information knowing that you're already vulnerable

if you're an expert or you work in human services and want to help - people asking for help here need to be directed back to their local agency if it gets beyond general program help or advice  you should never solicit or accept personally identifiable information - doing so means you are no longer operating in a private capacity because you're offering to use your professional credentials without a valid business purpose for someone whose identity you have not confirmed  this poses a risk to this subreddit to you personally and potentially to either the customer who is asking for help or to someone seeking to misuse that information  because reddit is anonymous providing them any help from that risks a disclosure of protected information completely aside from hipaa

i am leaving this post open for now for commentary and discussion from the community but please keep it constructive"

all in all hours are picking back up to what they were at the beginning now but i haven't gotten paid yet which is in a week either way i've been struggling to pay my electric bill for months and even when i do get paid that little extra than i've been getting - i have other bills i need to catch up on bad

"anyone else been judged by looks or words while paying with ebt i’m  &amp; currently receive ebt because the job i have doesn’t pay me enough to be able to afford groceries i remember when i was  i worked at a grocery store as a courtesy clerk bagger &amp; the cashiers would always talk trash about customers under their breath if they were paying with ebt i even had one coworker at the time always obnoxiously ask out loud so everyone could here him—- if the customer was paying with ebt food or ebt cash  if he seen that they whipped out their food stamps card 

fast forward to age  now  i always think about those times whenever i’ve purchased groceries lately i sometimes avoid going into lines that have cashiers that look like they would be judgmental because i too have experienced discrimination while paying with food stamps i honestly see why some people who have like + items would rather choose to use self checkout 

the way i see it is  most people would take ebt if they knew they qualified  also —if you’re not paying for another’s person’s food for survival  what’s it to you the method of payment that people use to feed their families

when do i need to report income hi arizona resident here family of three my income went from zero dollars to about  monthly when do i need to actually report that i have income when i talked to the case manager originally i was under the impression that i only need to report it if it was over a certain amount but now i can’t remember what the amount is is this true if so what is the amount will my benefit amount change
"new to snap have questions hey guys

i just recently received notification that i qualify for snap benefits yay i don’t get the maximum amount but enough to really help with my groceries

so i just started walking dogs for a little side money and i’m unsure of whether i need to report the income or not this happened after my snap interview so it’s not like i withheld info or anything and it’s not even that much should i report this income even if it is really small i’m afraid of losing my benefits because my income is already on the threshold 

another thing is that i applied after a pay period where i had missed days so my paycheck was lower than usual i reported how many hours i usually work however and i did indicate how much my paycheck usually is and they still gave me the benefits i am also going to get overtime next week working on the holiday so my paycheck will be more than usual is that going to be ok or should i report that too

i’m so stressed about losing my benefits- i really need the help because the cost of living here is so high but i also don’t want to do anything illegal help me out please

edit: state is ny"

partner is starting work - won't be eligible anymore how long do we have to spend our benefits between november and now we have been eligible for snap in ca because of the extra covid allotments it has been quite a good amount for us with just my job we actually made decent enough money and barely qualified with a base benefit of $ but p-ebt brings that up to $ therefore we still have a decent amount unspent in fact we are even going to get the next emergency allotment still which will leave us with - months worth of groceries on our ebt card my wife starts a new job soon and definitely we will not be eligible anymore how long do we have to use these benefits - do we have to spend them before i let calfresh know we are no longer eligible or do we keep them longer i suppose i can go to costco and stock our freezer full of meat if i have to

"bank limit and employment situation hi

i’m in ohio spouse and i are full time grad students with a toddler and have graduate assistantships of  hours a week from august until may (academic year) not receiving income from the gaship in the summer but still formally employed by the university (as in the gaship hours and biweekly pay start back up in the fall) spouse has a part time job income still coming in but not enough on its own to meet all summer expenses 
i received the notification that i need to renew my snap but have a couple of concerns as i am submitting the form and verification docs:

 i am worried about employment status and how it’ll be considered would this situation suffice for the work requirement 
 we received a stimulus payment for us and our child which leaves our bank balance higher but because of reduced income this is pretty much going to be spent up on summer rent and expenses we have no other income or anything by the time i do my phone interview/go through renewal though it’ll still exceed the limit a bit is this something to be concerned about should i just send in the rent contract and utilities bills for verification is upcoming expenses something the county considers

&amp;#xb;

 i am attempting to include an image of a portion of my notice of decision/explanation of benefits so i don’t confuse anybody further i hope it works 

&amp;#xb;

under the heading “benefit month”  (line#) there is a date range of //-// with a corresponding benefit amount of $ per month  now this is the explanation of benefits i received before i had uploaded any documentation and before they reduced the monthly amount to $ my questions are: what does that date range of december   to october   represent i think it’s showing that my son and i have been approved for benefits for a full year i don’t think i was expecting that and also since the amount got reduced to $/month does that mean once the pandemic is over that will be the end of our benefits i don’t understand i guess why did we receive what looks like the november benefit of $ and then it looks like we received the december benefit twice ($) then $ on /…along with the $ on dec  however the $ was received in november and not december ugh my brain hurts lol any help in deciphering would be appreciated

when i initially applied (online) they requested a lot of documents service bills ids etc

i'm grateful for getting the help at all but confused why it was reduced to about / of what it previously was when nothing has changed  does anyone have insight on this did she maybe add something in twice (multiple sources of income) or did they do it wrong on the last renewal and i never actually qualified for the max benefits to begin with"

"overissue of calfresh benefits while on unemployment i was out of a job in late  / early  i was on unemployment at the max $ per week unemployment was reported to calfresh each week california / calfresh

fast forward to today; i got a letter saying all of the calfresh benefits i got in  were an overpayment and i owe them $

why did they even issue me benefits if i was reporting my edd/ui income to them they knew how much i was ‘making’ and still provided benefits anyone fight something like this or do i just have to pay"
still no extra in ny 
why am i getting a large amount of benefits im a bit confused bc i supposed to off ebt due to getting a job but suddenly im receving - in benefits these past two months does anyone know why im getting such large amounts of money despite being told i no longer am eligible i did change my family size to  so i thought maybe its possible backlog of money
"i feel like i’m getting nowhere with this pebt (texas) i’ve posted on here before i applied for pebt on june second in the morning when the application link went live for the last several weeks i’ve been told that my application is in ‘pending’ or ‘exemption’ status nobody at the pebt help line could give me any more info and they also refused to escalate after the  week mark i called the ombudsman office of the hhsc they got back to me and basically told me that my application is with the tea and had been there for a few weeks they said there’s nothing they can do they also said they don’t have any contact info for the department at the tea that is handling the applications i tried to contact someone at the tea and couldn’t get ahold of anyone by phone i emailed a few different emails and the very next day(last friday) a case worker from the hhsc called me and told me that she had been contacted by the tea and is supposed to get a call back by monday (this past monday) and that she would get back to me early in the week it’s thursday now and i haven’t heard back from her i called the number that she called me from which was a hhsc office in el paso tx i was on hold for an hour and  minutes when someone finally answered they told me that nobody works there by that name and that when they make calls out it doesn’t come from their number (the number i was calling) they suggested i call the pebt helpline i called them and they told me that there haven’t been any changes still in pending status 

i feel like i’ve just hit a wall i can’t get into contact with anyone who can actually give me any information it really sucks that we won’t get the benefits until after school has started thankfully my husband has found a new job but we could have really really used that help for a little while earlier this summer  when with only me working for a little bit we didn’t qualify for regular snap benefits is there any thing else i can try to get through to someone or do i just need to give up i feel like everyone keeps passing me along and i’m getting nowhere it’s incredibly frustrating"
"messed up my cal-fresh interview help if you can i misreported the amount of money i had in my bank account i said it was about  dollars but it’s really closer to  k i was under the impression that income matters but it doesn’t

"reported change in income still received full snap back when the pua was offered i had already been on snap in ohio for some time i applied for pua and received it a month or so later from may-july ish i reported it immediately when i saw that i was approved using my state's online benefits portal thing and even got the confirmation that i requested to make a change but they never closed my case or lowered my amount of snap or anything at the time i wrote it off because i kept hearing about things like that they were waiving closures and stuff during the pandemic looking back now i see that those were just things the states were **applying** to the usda for and they were **denied** to be allowed to do that

 i'm wondering if they ever even applied the income changes to my case and if there is anything i should do to protect myself from getting in trouble for this somehow i had even gone back on the page to report when my income changed back from pua ending and the $ pua amount i had entered was still on the form (implying to me they did receive the first change) i deleted it and reentered the correct amt for that time

how will my father’s death effect my benefits after probate ended and we sold the house i ended up getting a $ check the goal was to put that towards buying a plot of land for a future house but if we lose our benefits it will go towards medical bills and food and we will continue to have to rent does cashing this automatically disqualify us for benefits we are a two parent household with a child and only one of us has a job with low income it may be our only chance to save money also will buying land or house disqualify us

i finally got my printer working i go to upload the paperwork andthere's nothing there's nowhere to upload anything to her profile there's a notice marked today that i'm guessing they're intending to mail out that they've approved her benefits for a whopping $ dollars a month which is less than half of what she was getting before 

and no i don't mean the extended covid benefits she had already been getting the maximum $ long before covid and none of her income has changed nothing has gone up nothing has gone down 

i don't know why they reduced her benefits so much and i also don't know what to do now the number on her paperwork from them goes to a voicemail box ""that cannot receive new messages goodbye"" 

so i'm wondering if maybe there's been a change in the income limits she gets a total of around $ a month between her pension and her retirement has that put her over some sort of limit

i'm sorry if this is too broad to be answered and i do intend on trying to follow up with ebt themselves for clarification it's just been really hard to get a hold of someone she had another stroke and her ability to do things on her own severely diminished so it's just all falling on me and i am very tired

"update / for walmart ebt shopping online update / for walmart ebt shopping online
hi i'm new here i was having the same problem with checking out through walmart online with my ebt card
i found a solution 

-enter your ebt card number before or during the transaction under your wallet
-go to ""your payment method"" under wallet
-then enter your new payment method as your ebt card then save

(this will allow you to add your entire ebt authorized number without missing any digits)

-after you've entered your ebt under your payment method wallet hit refresh
-now the entire number will show up at the end of your transaction and you will be able to put in your pin without any complications
-if you add your ebt number at the end of your transaction it does not accept all the digits on your ebt card therefore causing an error message

hope this helps"

"[ny] denied benefits at rectification because it was alleged that i have business that i have no knowledge of or participation in hi all

here's a doozy i was denied snap benefits at my latest re-certification because it was alleged that i have a business that i do not own didn't start and do not participate in

i asked in a letter/fax where this information came from and to please furnish me with a copy it took them  weeks to send me an except from a lexisnexis accurint report that lists a business that started in  at the address i reside at it doesn't attach the business to me/my name only to my address the worker who sent it tried to redact a portion of it but when held up to the light says that there were no filings associated with this business

again i have no knowledge of this business of any kind

i sent a notarized letter attesting to the fact that i do not have any interest ownership participation or knowledge in this business i even sent my own personal lexisnexus report that does not list any business of any kind

my taxes from  and  that i sent also do not have any business of that kind on it just my landscaping and scrap metal oddjobs my bank statements of a full year that i sent also do not in any way reflect that business in question

here's the kicker: the worker said that i have this business which she believes is an internet businessand that many people started internet businesses during the pandemic she then asks for proof that the business is defunct this is an illogical and impossible request since it would be asking me to prove a negative

i asked for a supervisor and sent a letter asking for a supervisor to intervene never heard anything back also asked for an agency conference but never heard back and when i called and spoke to a live person they said they wouldn't grant one but that i should request a hearing instead so i requested a fair hearing

i live with another adult family member but have always stated factually that i buy and prepare my own meals

i believe this started because the case worker on this latest recertification may have noticed at the time that i had over $ in benefits left but that surplus has been there for more than a year but i have been exhausting most of each monthly benefit and that balance stayed more or less the same for almost a year thanks to the extra pandemic benefit of $

when i reapplied with a new application recently while waiting for my fair hearing this issue is coming up again why this time they are asking for proof from irs and state regarding the status of the business in question i told them that it is impossible for me to obtain something i have no affiliation with and to please refer to my notarized statement

what is going on

no investigator ever called or showed up and this issue has been going on since june can't see why an investigator would bother with this since no kids and no fraud is at work and an investigator can easily look up on state register for any llc or inc i did and no such business exists if a sole proprietorship then it would reflect in my taxes which it doesn't so why are my consistent statements about this alleged business being ignored

how do i possibly satisfy this issue on their part

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

update: //

so on saturday morning (/) i was checking to see the status of my current snap application online and to my surprise it said ""approved"" 

&amp;#xb;

but here's the kicker: when i went to check my snap balance not only did i get the prorated portion from this month (starting from day of the approved application) but also for august and september including the pandemic $ for each month 

i think the person preparing the evidence packet for my hearing on nov  looked at the situation and realized the error made by the previous caseworker 

&amp;#xb;

i guess my fair hearing is moot now if i get a letter in the mail by tuesday stating the reasoning why they decided to go back and add the  months for which my fair hearing is concerned i will cancel/withdraw my hearing request otherwise i will have to go forward with it and if the agency decides to withdraw (which by this action already suggests they have) i happily would agree 

i don't know who to thank at the agency be it my current caseworker who i had before and she was a gem or an unnamed supervisor so i'll just thank them all it's a hard thankless job 

&amp;#xb;

and thanks to everyone who took the time to reply and to read "
no emergency/max allotment payment after recertification (michigan) i completed the  month recertification for my family’s food stamp case amount was lowered overall to $ after pay rise at work and prorated for only $ because my caseworker didn’t complete it until a couple days into october fast forward to now: i normally receive payment on the st however i got the lower proration amount on the th michigan emergency allotments (additional benefits to equal household max; my family of  is $) we’re supposed to pay out by oct th and i didn’t get anything nor do i have any pending benefits my caseworker says they can’t do anything about it my family is going to struggle until the  of november if we don’t get the max allotment any suggestions

"mn - employment related questions hey all was hoping i could get some guidance on a few things

so i applied and was approved for snap in october of this year initially i had a job that pays minimum wage + tips for roughly  hours/week well due to a myriad of reasons my hours have been dramatically cut i'm lucky if i get even twenty hours a week sometimes well the situation has escalated and i now have not been put on the schedule at all for next week

the good news is i do have another job a nannying job that is set to start on january th what steps should i be taking in order to keep my snap secure if i choose to leave my current job entirely would i not be subject to the penalty due to the fact that my hours have been cut so dramatically and i haven't really been left with any other choice other than to seek other employment snap has been a huge help to me these last several months and i want to make sure i'm going to be in good standing i would call social services but the office is closed for the day thanks"
"need to know procedure for using snap hi my daughter was recently accepted for snap  she's autistic and nervous about using the card especially since she's witnessed people in supermarkets having problems using it in the past i'd like to be able to run her through the procedure so she knows what to expect

my particular concern is what will happen if she chooses items that aren't covered i can make sure she has some money with her to cover this if it happens but will it be a simple thing or will it be a big humiliating deal"

"california snap application only shows pending application for one person on the account so i couldn't actually get a straight answer from sar  workers and despite us having everything they asked we needed to reapply i got around to it the other day and filled it out for both me and my partner same as last time i didn't do anything different and my name is the main one on the application

we're going to do the interview tomorrow since i'm too dizzy to actually sit up today but i checked to see the status of the application seems to have been filed under my partner only there's a new section showing all his information and says it's pending for him i'm looking at the summary of the application and i am on application and even listed as the main applicant but the old case number we have with both of us still says discontinued

what the hell happened i'm so confused as to why it's now filed under just him as we need both on the account to have enough to eat for the month plus he's not even listed as the main applicant

"walmart anyone get food from online walmart

snap gives very very little money amazon is already very expensive it's not even 'amazon fresh' (which si basically whole foods) that is very expensive it's the regular groceries on amzon - those are already very expensive

only if ppl lived in the most expensive places would online corps be worth buying from but theres almost nobody that gets snap and lives in the most expensive places

snap gives very very little money and so price would matter to anyone with snap looked at a few items at walmart and was surprise that walmart even had higher prices than amazon for same items  

is anyone else seeing that i don't know if it was always like that - or if it's that walmart got a monopoly and just started raising all prices so the rich can make more and more money

i don't know if it was the mega corps that contacted 'snap' or  'snap'  that contacted the mega corps but it was very likely the  mega corps that contacted 'snap' since the super rich greedy mega corps  just wants more and more money - even from the gov and the ppl this is likely a correct guess

&amp;nbsp;

a person said that 

&gt; it's a challenge to find anyone other than amazon and walmart who're authorized to accept ebt

so i guess that answers the question of if there's any other online stores that take ebt so  i guess don't need to ask if theres any other options out there for online stores


there are likely online shops that have bulk items at bigger discounts than local stores but i guesss none take ebt based on what that person said for now decided to not use online stores expect for a few items where amazon would save a few cents here and there

i don't know if there are any common basic foods that walmart cost less in (for same very similiar items)


&amp;nbsp;

also you gotta buy alot from amzon to have  no cost delivery - like the fridge only got so much space poor ppl dont got big fridges you know some items that cost less are fridge items but that's a huge cost in space and the food would spoil 

also % off prime is extremely expesnive and not worth it even if had that kinda of money per year


&amp;nbsp;

also hot foods are there any states where everyone/anyone who has snap can get hot foods 

just wondering which states are leading in the snap wwelfare thing even tho welfare in usa is likely much worst than some other rich places like canada or smaller rich nations

&amp;nbsp;

as for this newer post that likely isnt a real post 

answer is you should leave them alone in peace cos getting a tiny bit of money is nothing compared to the massive corruption is elsewhere in corporations and govs"
"question about loss of income form fl i was laid off from my job a few weeks ago applied for benefits and already had my phone interview i was told to get a proof of employment/loss of income form filled out; they sent it over to me and the top portion had not been fully filled out (but my case number was filled in) 

can anyone confirm if anymore information than this is necessary do they have to fill out the return by date office address etc stupid question maybe but am i supposed to fill that part out

"gi bill benefits mha countable income for snap hello i am having a hard time finding clear information about gi bill educational benefits and whether or not they are considered countable income towards snap eligibility in md in their manual under “excluded income” it says: 

b educational assistance
educational assistance which is awarded to a household member enrolled at a
recognized institution of post secondary education at a school for persons with
disabilities in a vocational education program or in a program that provides for
obtaining a secondary school diploma or the equivalent of a secondary school
diploma this includes but is not limited to:
 grants
 scholarships
 fellowships
 educational loans on which payment is deferred
 work-study
*** veteran's educational benefits***

my husband (veteran) just started receiving mha (monthly housing allowance) via post- gi bill benefits he is not in college (i know that students are often not eligible) but is instead completing a full-time (paid) on the job training program-which just also happens to qualify for gi bill benefits is this mha benefit included does it count towards our total monthly income and eligibility for snap etc thank you"

"a little lost in the qualification sauce (orange ca) orange ca

hi everyone hopefully someone might be able to give me some insight i'm a little lost

i am a  year old independent student who receives cal grant: no rent and my last date of work was // i have stocks $ ira and a $ regular account

i was recently told that my cal grant qualifies me for ebt which i would like to take advantage of

i was originally getting it for a few months (late ) when my hours were cut during the pandemic but i reached a point where i could support myself again (and luckily my rent and utilities dropped to near $ for now) and so i just stopped using the card figuring it would cancel out after non-use

it did not and i was notified i needed to complete my sar my school's ebt advisor told me to just send it in and update the work/rent differences

the thing is i don't know what my original application stated (to make relevant updates) and i cannot see it on the portal i as well do not know if i need to apply as a student instead of the loss of income i experienced last year however the card has been collecting funds for quite some time and now has a very large sum k+

i don't want to spend the money as i feel like something is missing the ebt advisor seemed nonchalant and kept saying don't worry about it nobody is checking which feels and sounds wrong

i have scoured the internet but keep finding so many conflicting information sources and the gov sites are just bad

how can i know if i truly qualify i feel as though my stocks alone should unqualify me but i do not recall being asked about them in the initial setup and my sar has been processed and approved

is there any resource out there that would allow me to meet with a california ebt expert/lawyer at a low cost or perhaps someone here is familiar with california ebt structures i don't want to break the law

edit\* my site is calwin and i applied through getcalfreshorg

thank you all so much for any information you can provide

if there is any other relevant information i can provide i will be happy to provide"
"is it ok to let food stamps accumulate to save for later and did i mess up the application weird situation ma 

two person household both adults i applied for food stamps a while back at a household income of $/mo with rent and utilities of a little over $/mo and a bunch of medical expenses denied ie zero benefits ok no problem 

later income fell to $ and i started falling behind on bills so i reapplied and got approved for the maximum amount plus the covid bonus 

honestly our grocery spending jumped up a lot with the snap (retail therapy lol) but i can’t quite wrap my head around spending almost $ per person on food is this weird i feel super self-conscious getting a bunch of luxury items like cookies and yogurt and frozen dinners 

anyway it said to report if our income increased by “more than $” of course it did we can’t keep falling more behind on rent forever so i called to report an increase of $/week as soon as it happened i figured this would put us out of eligibility because that’s more than the original $ and then we’d just spend down the remaining benefits over - months 

they said on the phone that i didn’t need to report that because it wasn’t enough to make a difference but to tell them at the six month review which i would receive in the mail what 

are they likely to take back the unused food stamps at the month mark should i be stocking up on canned goods  because i am nervous for when they cut us off and i’m still working on paying the back-rent and credit card (which might take a year+) 

will i owe the government money after  months once they re-calculate snap based on  months of substantial income i can’t shake the feeling that i’ve done something wrong and i’m cheating the system"

unfortunately i think the letter that said i was approved for benefits got lost in the mail( but i did get my pin and ebt card) so i don’t know when i’ll have to recertify when i do recertify if i don’t have a new job by then will they kick me off of the program i have a full time job offer that will start in june but i’m not sure if i’ll be able to get any work between then and now so i’m hoping i will be able to get benefits until i graduate in june"
"income limits and deductions texas i'm so confused by the information the official texas hhsc website has vs what  operators say we were denied food stamps and the numbers don't add up

hhsc website says working family deductions include % of gross income shelter expenses and standard deduction for utilities not included in rent 
 operator couldn't find in the system where there's the % of income deduction 
after submitting check stubs our income was $ so okay over the $ if going by the formula she said they use but why even ask about shelter costs etc if they aren't factored in and where the heck is the % of gross income deduction factored in even if the deductions didn't subtract dollar for dollar against income for some reason the shelter/utilities deductions would put us under the limit i can't even speak to an actual caseworker and i can't make sense of how they make decisions any caseworkers here have any insight thanks"

so i filed a complaint on august th to which i was told it would take  days i reapplied for snap on october  and went ahead and uploaded all the documentation i thought they would need from paycheck stubs to proof of bank balances i escalated the current application yesterday it dawned on me though that i never received a response from the complaint i filed in august so i called back today to see if they had the results of that in my case file i was told the complaint was never ""forwarded out"" therefore nothing was done about it the lady i spoke with refiled the complaint and said she confirmed that it was forwarded out this time 

does anyone have experience with filing complaints with hhsc and the time frame it actually takes to get a resolution i know they said  days but i've completely lost faith in the system i've been trying to get an answer from them since the end of august and at this point we can barely afford to buy food for  days a pay period much less the entire week luckly my older two kids get free lunch at school but i have  very small children at home that also need to eat  is there any other ""higher up"" to escalate my case to

"caseworker discontinued my benefits i'm not entirely sure where to go from here

i live in ohio i applied and got approved for snap benefits at the end of september recieved the card and had a balance and everything when i had my phone interview i was told i had until october st to send in all of my requested verifications

i was told the easiest way to send things in was to upload them via the online portal so that's what i did and had everything sent in by october th

i then got a notification that i had a message saying i still needed to send in the requested verifications and i had to do it by october th

i checked the portal it showed my uploads but that nothing was pending or being reviewed so i called my county jfs number and the woman i spoke to said ""we don't  have any of your verifications i wish they would stop telling people to upload documents on the portal because half of the time it doesn't work"" i asked her why i was told they had to be in by the th now and she said i still had until the st and gave me the info to send everything through email 

i sent everything in again through email this time and it was done by the th i gave it over a week then on the th called to check the status and it said ""no verifications for your case have been recieved for review in the last  days"" so once again i'm staying on the line waiting to speak to a real person finally had someone tell me they recieved and have all of my requested verifications so i'm thinking okay great i can stop stressing out now 

annnd then i got an email on the th saying they had issue with the utility bill i sent in (i rent from my parents and the bills are in my dads name) they said they couldn't find me under his name for the utility bill and that i need to provide an old address or dob theres no other address though i've lived at this one my whole life and no one could answer me about who's dob they needed 

so i called again and the woman i talked to this time said they have everything they need and she didnt know why my caseworker sent that and then she told me my caseworker had a note that said i still hadn't sent any of my other requested documents in literally the end of the month now and right before the weekend the woman i talked to said she sent over to notify my caseworker that they had everything and that she needed to review it and call me back i checked the portal yesterday and it said my benefits had been discontinued called again and was told the same thing that i just had to wait for her to review everything and get back to me

so here i am november nd with a snap status marked as discontinued and a caseworker that has not and will not answer any of my questions and apparently wont review my documents 

i guess i'm just wondering if anyone has been in a situation like this before should i just sit tight and wait or try to request a different caseworker"

"looking for info for my situation ohio sorry for the long post im trying to give as much info as i can 

for the past few years i had my own apartment as a single mother with  kids i was on and off food stamps depending on my situation (income fluctuations) but always had medicaid for us it was fairly easy as not much changed except income and everything was in my name and i was good at keeping records it was very easy to upload copies of w- leases registrations paystubs etc

this year a lot changed for us and i updated every step of the way but i know some changes were made to the snap program and honestly i did miss an appointment so my food stamps got cut off in august that was my fault and i get that i didn't get the letter in the mail cause i had just moved  i just reapplied and the way the questions are posed can be confusing and i just am worried about how to answer so i don't look like i'm trying to fraud anything and can provide the right documents 

i'll explain my living situation:

like i said i had my own place and worked  normie jobs to support us and still received benefits so i am (or thought) i was pretty well versed with the process i lost one job a year ago and another over the summer and it has been a struggle since to find a job that works with my chaotic single mom/shitty car schedule so i'm unemployed scraping by doing odd jobs and gigs and borrowing from my parents when i really need to

my mom got divorced last spring and her ex husband moved out me and the kids moved in over the summer my daughter is  not in school (graduated hs) my son is  and in th grade my mom is over  and is getting ssi as well as medicaid and a small amount of food stamps (like $) she has her own benefit case for just herself 

i'm not technically (on paper) paying rent but i do and pay half the bills and anything my kids and mom need she has a hard time with everything shes getting older doesnt work and has her own health issues i also cook clean and fix everything in the house believe me i work my ass off to earn my keep i don't sleep all day and do nothing i grow a lot of our own food and recycle and reuse as much as possible to try and be as self sustainable as possible it's almost become addicting to see how minimalist i can be and get by comfortably without the need to make a bunch of money 

however i know i need to provide more for our household especially being winter and i can't grow much during winter 

my daughter is  and does instacart shopping with her friend she doesn't have her own car its just pocket money for her nothing she can live on her own with 

no bills or anything are in my name i claimed on my application that i'm self employed as a maid what that means though is i clean houses for a few people i know each week it's cash and nothing is contracted or deposited through a bank or claimed on taxes (i just started this as a regular thing) 

i also claimed i pay $ in rent a month but again i don't have a lease or anything like that my mom doesn't want me to because she has her own case she's afraid the added income to her (that she doesn't claim) will count against her and she will lose her benefits but that's too bad because i do pay and i need to tell them that

i have a car but it doesn't work so transportation is extremely difficult until i get the funds to fix it the people i clean for live in my neighborhood and i walk there 

so having said all that and being as honest as i can be i have several questions that i've been googling and searching for but i always end up confused because of my living situation also i live in ohio

what documents can i provide that are acceptable can i just hand write (type up and print) everything on separate papers sign and date them and thats ok

what will happen to my moms benefits if i claim i pay her $ a month i don't know her exact income from her spousal support payments or her ssi but its not that much i don't think it'll take her over the threshold but i could be wrong 

should i only claim its me and my son and then my mom and daughter have their own separate applications 

even if my car isn't working do they still consider it a viable mode of transportation i know that is one exemption from with work requirements is no transportation 

also do i have work requirements while i have dependents 

would we get more a month if we were all on the same account or do we legally have to be seperate or do we legally have to be together

no utilities are in my name is that gonna be an issue how do i prove i pay bills when it's just cash 

i have no tax records of any of these changes cause it all just happened this year 

i'm just so confused now and i have tried reading but i struggle with understanding what it means for me as i have learning disabilities (not the kind i can claim)  the people and case workers i've talked to seem to get very frustrated with me and rude so i hate talking to them and asking questions 

thank you for reading my super long post i hope it's comprehensive"

"[calfresh]discontinued recert stlll processing i had my recertification due this month and i uploaded it and they received it like on th i think but its still 'waiting to processed'

i've been trying to call but haven't got through i also chose the option to have a rep call me back  times but they never do i received an enotice about a 'missed interview' but they never sent me a enotice about it and never called me that day anyways

seems odd to discontinue it before the th considering it says on a form they sent me that i had to upload the form by the th which i did and that i have to complete an interview by the th 

anyone seen this before it says it can't show me the reason for it either so i gotta wait for something in the mail i guess

update:

i got a hold of them today and got it all sorted out i guess i missed a question on the form and i needed to actually sign my income statement i uploaded i had just uploaded a txt file previously so i did that and they processed it within an hour  was very quick once i got through which took  hours or so very helpful people there

"pa-snap questions rent change income change trying to help my cousin figure this stuff out it's somewhat confusing my cousin is living with a friend (old man) since late  hasn't been paying rent due to man being nice and also helping him with stuff (he's done a lot for him) no job has been dealing with a lot of health issues (hospitalized a bunch of times but is much better now) has snap and medicaid snap is maxed out i believe like $ a month food money obviously helps a lot medication is $ a month rather than $ a month originally he didn't use the snap for like  months or something because his uncle's gave him a ton of frozen and canned food surprised they never canceled it 

old man is very sick now (physically and mentally-dementia) and he can't live there anymore old man is getting really crazy has to find a new place asap like as soon as humanly possible room is filling with sewage daily when water is run too long he's going to get sick main line is broken or something old man doesn't care and cousin can't fix it and he's getting really crazy and accusatory (accusing him of crazy stuff he didn't do) and threatening him he could end up sleeping in his car 

cousin has a friend who lives in a nice small but cheap apartment not too far away only $ utilities included they have one unit left they're going to let him in it soon seems like because of his personal connection he also found a stopgap job for some income guy is going to let him tag along and help cut grass with him starting in march and pay him cash sounds like he'll make around $ a month doing that not a lot of hours  something a week not much but better than nothing 

should he call his caseworker to report this now or mail something instead to them does anyone know how this will affect his monthly snap payment medicaid thanks"

"food stamp interview months away (or) hey there i've been getting snap for exactly a year and we submitted the recertification earlier this month i got a call today saying they want to do a phone interview in may excuse me i'm so confused does this mean we won't get benefits until the interview they said we could call to do it earlier is that our only hope there was no information about anything else no indication that we filled anything out wrong just a notice of an interview

"completed calfresh interview… now my benefitscal case vanished so today i got an email from benefitscal saying that i need to call and complete my interview i called and gave them all my information and was told there was a possibility that i could get approved as soon as by the end of day so i logged on to benefitscal around the end of the work day and suddenly all my applications are gone when i try to link my case # it says they couldn’t find it not even using my ssn i had just gotten approved for medi-cal but now i can’t even find the message stating my approval   


i’m worried because during my interview i was asked about income and mentioned that i receive monthly payments (only enough to cover my rent)  due to a permanent injury lawsuit settlement from when i was a baby that left me with a disability (not enough to qualify for ssi but enough to make it hard for me to find work) but combined with the income i make from my on and off again job (get paid a flat rate to teach classes at a small business a few times a month it’s the only job i’ve been able to get) i‘m still a ways under the gross income limit i also have some money in my checkin/savings that i was hoping i wouldn’t have to use while i look for work could that disqualify me i was under the impression it was based on income but i don’t really know the whole process has taken me days of frustration and confusion and is really becoming a pain to deal with any info is appreciated"

a while later i recieved a letter saying i needed proof of something related to ssi/disability which at that point we had gotten a lawyer to help us fight that whole mess since i'd been denied  times at that point i don't know what grandma did about that

"food stamps asking for my info i'm not on the benefits food stamps (tx) reached out to my tenant earlier this month asking for my information (citizenship income time of move into residence) i am the owner of the house and not on the benefits case to receive benefits (i make too much and did not apply) we have a  month old together that lives with us too we did have a time where paperwork was filed as us being common law married in the past but since then she had put single status on future paperwork 

anyone know why they would want my status and cut off her benefits could it be the child the common law statement or even living together

called the hotline and they stated that it was because i live in the same household as someone receiving benefits and would not say anything else (even had to get my tenant on the phone cause they would not talk to me even though they want info about me)

"which way is better hi everyone

this is probably a weird question i've been living with family for years but have been getting food stamps i explained that i buy food and eat separately from them which is the truth and they granted me a decent amount per month but it was my mom's house and she passed away not long ago if i stay there i'm stuck living with my sister her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend it's too small there and i hate the overall atmosphere

i have a fiancé who was living in a medical rehab center after having a stroke he was recently discharged and we have gotten a low income apartment together it's illegal for me to use my food stamps to buy food for both of us so we need to apply for him to get them too here is where my question comes in

i have zero income he has a military pension which isn't much but it's enough to pay our subsidized rent he is still way below the poverty line and should be eligible for something the dilemma is how do we apply

should i tell them i'm moving in with him and then we apply as a couple or should we make an application for him alone and buy our food separately will aligning myself with another person take away my benefits even if that other person is also low income has anyone here ever been in this situation what did you do how did it turn out we are in utah

thank you in advance"

"question abotu a child turning  my family receives snap benefits in utah and has for a long time

we are also on housing ssi and medicaidi

in mid march our son turns  - a full time student and on track to graduate (missing x  credits iirc)our son also works at a local taco bell

we were informed that with my son's income will put us over the income threshold of $ a month (this is supposed to change in march)when  this happens - we will be ineligible to receive snap benefits for the month of april and will have to have everything settled by may  or we are cut off until we reapply

in essence this means we have to move our son out of the house before he graduates if we want to survive for the  and / months until he graduates 

or 

we don't get snap benefits for that time period of &amp;/ months with all the ramifications attached to that and have  days to get him moved out of the house before we are cut off and have to reapply entirely (may -may )

update: i reached out to some of my community and they explained to me that they experienced the same situation when trying to recertify their benefits a while back by starting a new application and keep doing it until they were able to get approved for a long term period also apparently the website has been ‘under maintenance’ for months no one has been picking up the phone and ever since the city opened back up it’s been more difficult to get benefits most likely i’ll have do this this which is frustrating i think i’m going to continue updating this post so that anyone experiencing the same can refer to it wish me luck yall"

"calworks replacement in ca i am not sure if there is a better subreddit to pose this question but given that they are very similiar benefits and at least in ca generate from the same place i figured i would ask here

my question is pretty straightforward

is it possible to receive a replacement payment for calworks especially if it is your only source of income right now

so on friday i checked the benefits portal to see when our calworks deposit would be made and came across a letter they issued saying that our calworks was in the process of being deposited to our bank account problem is we never requested that they direct deposited our assistance to that bank account as it had a negative balance and with children need all the money we can receive to make matter worse when i checked our bank account the bank closed down our account without telling us and don't know when they closed it or what happened to those assistance funds

i've tried calling our worker and the bank but given the holiday no one is in left messages etc and plan on calling our worker first thing tomorrow as well

while i wait i was just trying to ascertain whether they do offer benefit replacements for folks typically and if not would they be able to given the fact that we never requested direct deposit our bank account is closed and we have no other source of income right now

this year it seemed to have happened again he recertified about a month ago except this time instead of getting a notice they simply didn't send him food stamps to his ebt card sometimes they're late and my dad waited but  weeks in (his deposit date is the rd) and nothing so he checked online and his case just says closed no warning no explanation nothing

we have been calling every day staying on hold for literal hours at a time and can't get through to a human being he needs those food stamps even with them the inflation in nyc is so bad it's not enough to last him through the month so without them he'll legitimately starve

has this happened to any of you did you get an explanation were you able to eventually get through to their office and if so how did the situation end thanks in advance happy holidays all"

"snap benefits stolen from all the way in ny i live in los angeles what do i do hi everyone terrible thing just happened to me went to walmart to buy some groceries and when i went to pay at the checkout i only had  cents in my account thought it was very strange and when i checked my transaction history someone spent  dollars in some random bodega in new york

unfortunately seems like someone somehow got my card information and used my card to buy random crap i am not sure if credit card skimmers can impact ebt cards or if one of my online accounts was compromised

at the moment i changed my pin of my current card and am changing the passwords of all my online accounts anyone know if its possible to report this fraud will i be reimbursed

&amp;#xb;

edit: theft happened  days ago on //"

"possible unintentional fraud food stamps i lost my home and car and was under a lot of stress at the end of  i went by the office and got a change of address form when i was getting ready to move i had a place picked out and had the form filled out i was going to rent from a friend who was moving and renting her home out and she told me to basically just copy the lease i had received from the other option and change the name address and amount  things changed shortly after that and i had to go get another change of address form since we decided to move into a place that cost less and i had already filled out the other one i just wasn't paying attention when i emailed the information i pulled up the wrong lease and filled in the address which made it show the correct address wrong landlord name and wrong cost of rent the  leases were identical other than that since she didn't have one and had me just use the other and change the address and all that i just simply wasn't paying attention and was never even interviewed had someone called to confirm i would have heard that and known it was wrong i was approved and life went on and i had no clue time for new application recently and i let the benefits lapse because i didnt need them they were off for about a month i just reapplied and sent my lease and everything else all at one time it was assigned to a new case worker i was looking through all my emails and just found the error and now i'm afraid they found it i spoke to a man who claimed he would interview me ""next friday"" and i would get a letter i got a letter saying my app was received and another saying it was denied because of ""certification in another household"" i have no clue what this means i called and all he said was he had everything he needed and submitted the app on the th as of the th i checked my account and it shows i've been certified until june  and my monthly allotment is $ when i call his line his voicemail doesn't say food stamp division but rather just dhr so i'm thinking it's a dude and dhr and he's an investigator when i called to find out when my appt would be for an interview he said he had everything he needed so i didn't need an interview nd time not interviewing i like to be called so i can hear everything and verify its correct i cant pull up the pdf emails from my phone and didn't previously have a computer so i truly had no clue i had sent the wrong lease last november it was an honest mistake i am terrified they are investigating me and not telling me i cant sleep and my anxiety is just out of this world i'm a single mom and love my babies i would never intentionally lie about anything like this should i call and tell them i found the error or just wait for them to contact me will i go to jail over this i'm assuming i was overpaid $ or so unless they are also counting the max amount i am in alabama"
"still no benefits loaded onto nebraska ebt card hello my room mate has been approved for snap benefits and received his ebt card it's been activated and the website says benefits should be loaded on the rd of every month

&amp;#xb;

however when he calls to check his balance it says the card is activated and the pin is set but ""currently there are no benefits for this card"" he sufferers from crippling anxiety and hasn't worked up the gumption to call and ask why yet

&amp;#xb;

i figured i'd come her and see if this was a normal thing or to get any advice because he needs food and i'm not sure how worried to be from what i understand it's a ""big no no"" to buy him food while he's on the program so i don't wanna mess that up if his benefits are just late

will my savings affect me i've been on calfresh for about  years now i am a single mom of a  year old boy when i applied i was working part time at a salon and babysitting here and there applying in office they asked me several questions about my situation i told them that i had $k in savings and $k in checking (this was fine for my situation i guess) when i told her that i babysat sometimes she said i didn't make enough for it to matter and didn't put it down after struggles at my job i decided to quit and try to stay home with my son (i live with my mom so only expense is really food gas car insurance and cellphone) i still babysit once in awhile in order to save money and when i know i have an expense coming up in the  years i have been able to maintain my savings and put some in an account for my son i've always been honest with them and tell them that i babysit under the table and ask how to prove/report that they have always said not to worry about it as long as it is under the $ in a monthi never make that much a couple of days ago i got a letter saying they needed more information (bank statements and proof of my going to school) i sent in everything they wanted and now i'm nervous they will question my savings and take away benefits also i made $ in the month previous reporting month which shows in the statement the $ was a total of  months of babysitting i didn't mention it because it was under the $ i haven't hidden anything and always give them what they ask for will i be in trouble for still saving money having a cushion and the deposited check i'm so stressed about this

"[fl] just getting this off my chest though advice welcome disclaimer first: i know call center and case workers for snap are overworked underpaid and a variety of mistakes simply happen because that's life i am always diplomatic patient polite and thank the reps i speak to for listening and working with me on any issues because of this (i used to be a  operator before outsourcing and cell phones happened i know what the call center life is like)

i'm self-employed and use the snap work calendar form from my state's form depository to track my income every month  this is only my second renewal since working this way i've had upload problems before so i've learned that not only do i have to check the site's preview function to make sure it uploaded a document correctly before i save it and it's processed i also have to call the general line to confirm with a rep 

i did all of that three weeks ago a week later i have my phone interview she tells me only my november calendar uploaded but no worries just upload the october calendar call the exact number on my screen back to let her know and she'll process it i have it done in minutes and call back but it goes to voicemail (which says calls are returned within - hours)  where i leave a message 

later that night my case is updated with an information letter that just als for ""proof of income"" i figure this is just standard and she hasn't gotten to review the new info yet  i call the general line the next day to confirm the october calendar is uploaded correctly i'm told it is 

i never get a call back from the case worker this week my case is denied the only reason written on the form is ""did not provide proof of income"" i call the case worker's line get voicemail leave a message i call the general line and there i am told that the notes on my case say that the *november* calendar is cutoff and therefore does not include my signature and is invalid i explain that this detail is nowhere in any of my letters my phone interviewer specifically told me november was fine and just needed october (and that i hadn't misunderstood which month given the fact that her original issue with the documents was that it was supposed to be one document with multiple pages but she could only get the last page for november to load) the rep says she'll send a note just reupload november i redo preview call again and confirm november this time as well as double check october again i'm told there is now still a  day window to process this 

i usually have benefits deposited on the th i try really hard to budget in order to not solely depend on this date in any month but things just didn't come together this time around my work pays when clients accept orders i have plenty of work done and awaiting acceptance but not in time for this pay period on top of that ssi calculated child support wrong and shorted our december payment so i'm already down $ for my budget while that appeal processes 

anyway i'm just frustrated because i double and triple checked for mistakes and was straight up not informed of one even though the notes in their internal system explained it and now i'm dealing with a delay i could have corrected two weeks ago if it had just been specified to me i can't know what i'm not told once the uploads are ""saved"" and ""processed"" i can't view them on their system to see what they see i've had it explained to me that the preview function isn't actually reliable because once i hit save a third party service processes the document and sends it to their internal server i guess physically mailing documents will just have to be what i do to be sure they arrive intact i've had issues with faxes going through too 

if there's anything else i could have done differently or should ask about next renewal while doing all my follow up to preempt issues please share i've already called again today to see if there's anyway to escalate my call or expedite the process but that was a firm though gentle nope from a senior rep"
mom moving into the basement how can she get food stamps my fiance and i just bought our first home it has a finished basement and i'm going to move my mom in there she has had foodstamps and has had to provide a lease before as proof i don't actually plan on charging her 'rent' so she can finally be able to save money however they just discontinued her food stamps due to not being able to provide a lease agreement how can she get them back without us writing up a lease for her we also live in the home and don't want to lose the homestead exepmtion can anything be done we really couldn't afford her groceries as well as ours

"can i transfer my snap food balance to another state when moving i'm going to be moving to california next month to begin grad school i have snap food in my home state and in anticipation of higher grocery prices in the city where i'll be moving to have been very frugal with my benefits (food storage canned food etc) i have accumulated a little over $ in benefits

upon moving i'll need to transfer to ca benefits asap to get a health insurance waiver for my school through medical i know i will need to close my home state account before receiving benefits from ca but will i lose all my benefits will the balance still be spendable upon closing the account would i need to spend the whole balance before closing the account if i still wanted to use my benefits

"should we do a ""how to get snap"" megathread i've been seeing some megathreads elsewhere around benefits like unemployment and i'm wondering if we should marshal the collective knowledge here across our various states to give a really good overview of how people can go about applying and getting enrolled given everything (especially as call centers are or are soon to be slammed)

"can a card stay active if your balance is $ and your monthly benefits amount is $ hope this question makes sense i've been so confused by the process so i lost my job and i applied for snap when my income was zero and got the maximum allotment of benefits i believe (i had no assets or dependents and wasn't receiving any other assistance if it matters)

about a week ago i finally found another job that pays a couple dollars above minimum wage however after plugging in my new information to  i find that i pass the net monthly income test and asset test but i fail the gross monthly income test and my estimated ""potential monthly benefit amount""
 is $

 i am submitting my change of information now but i am wondering what that process looks like- is my card revoked/my account shut down because i make too much now or will my card and account stay active with a $ balance in case my income changes like if i lose this job or my hours get cut i am only barely making too much to be above the % poverty limit if i made about $ less per month i'd be below it 

i'm really hoping the later in case something happens and i lose this job so i won't have to go through the process again (it took me almost  weeks from applying to receiving my card and a month before getting any funds iirc which is why it scares me)

sorry that was really long but hopefully someone can help me out"

"random food items not eligible under foodstamps recently got on food stamps and i've been having this odd issue where some healthier cereals or foods aren't being accepted for example if i were to get the incredi-bowl cereal at rite aid it doesn't go through for food stamps but if i was to get some sugary cereal like lucky charms or some candy (which i can't eat) it's eligible

what's even more odd is that if i'm getting a meal replacement shake it'll go through for food stamps at rite aid but a different shake of the same type like muscle milk won't but when i look them up on say instacart for wegmans it says both are snap eligible

so does this vary by location and is there anywhere i can report an error for things like low sugar cereal being declined the cashier also said they can't see what items are being declined unless they check me out one item at a time so how do i even approach that at the grocery store where i'd have a lot more items do i just have to take ages to find out ""oh this one bread isn't going through"""

unfortunately my mother has lost her phone since she put in the application and the number she put on there when she reapplied is for that phone she has an alternate number that she's been calling the interview line on but when she calls there is just a recording that says ""thank you for calling the interview line we are temporarily no longer requiring to do an interview at this time if we need any information from you we will call you""

when we check the access fl page the status says ""pending"" going on  weeks now

"can you be banned from the program i live in stark county ohio   


in around  i was on food stamps while searching for a job but things fell through and i was taken off the program   


what fell happened is why i ask if you can be banned  


) i couldn't get transportation anywhere because the town i live in does not have bus services and i could not acquire transportation on top of that my case worker required me to finish one month of the program's requirements before sending me the check for transportation and when i tried to explain to her the complications she would not accept the issue and told me that if i continued to argue she will disqualify me and ban me from the program  


) they required me to complete a resume with specific information that i could not provide as i did not have a job to properly fill in their requirements  


) they required me to perform - hours a week  of ""community service"" or immediately lose benefits my small town only has one community service place: a food pantry that's open  days a week  hours a day so with the above issue of transportation i tried my hardest but could not complete such a task

"finally getting snap benefits after months of attempts (long rant) edit: state is washington dc which technically isn't a state that said might i say that ebt in maryland is a lot more efficient

so i applied for snap before halloween or i tried but didn't have enough paperwork and i am in the dc area where basically you have to sit in a welfare office for  hours just to be seen after doing that and taking time off work from my low paying job at least  times i finally get an application submitted i don't have time for an in person interview and i have crying children so i can't sit in the office for  hours on the fly so i request a phone interview and wait  weeks
 weeks pass and nothing happened so i go back to the snap office after  hours of waiting and more time taken off work i am told to call their number since they didn't call me things get easier at this point since with a job and  kids at home and babysitters being expensive/unreliable i need to do this over the phone each time i call it takes a minimum of  minutes to wait plus a  hour conversation to get maybe a small amount of the application processed thankfully i can send emails this is amazing compared to having to snail mail a document fax a document or worst case scenario wait in a  hour line to drop off a routine document which believe it or not is something they *encourage* for reasons i don't understand it's also especially important since the snap office straight up lost my original application which was in spanish a language i don't speak because they ran out of english language forms despite my special stamped receipt showing proof the office received and scanned my application the customer service hotline never got it which means the local office lost the form or never uploaded it to their main application server so i had to re-do my application

so anyway with phone calls and emails i am able to speed up the process and it's only taken me about a week and a half 
they tell me to go down today to an ebt card center to pick it up immediately

of course the card's not ready
thankfully the lady at the ebt card office is a seperate rd party company from the dhs of dc and she gave me a business card i can call so i don't have to spend  minutes in traffic driving down there every day just to pick up an ebt card i just have to get up every morning at am and make a phone call to check if it's ready no more pointless traveling 

of course i'm terrified i don't think it's over til it's over i have a case number now but no benefits have been uploaded yet i might get my card tommorow or in another week and i've got rent and bills to pay blech better late than never assuming they didn't screw up and assuming i will get it eventually and who knows what my actual balance will be the worker on the phone didn't know so the mysterious man behind the curtain has to make a decision first


tldr i tried to apply back in october was turned away because they were too busy i officially submitted an application in november before thanksgiving and re-submitted an application last week and now fingers crossed maybe i'll get it in - hours

phew
how many more hoops do i have to jump through i don't consider myself done until i have the card in my hand and i'm successfully purchasing groceries with it wish me luck"
"anyone else experience similar in louisiana i receive fs but wife didn't because shes a student with a job that didn't have enough hours

only explanation they can give is the yr old receives a ssi check which they count as my income however court has that check going to his mother ( x wife) i don't see a dime of that check nor is my address name or anything associated with it

so i've added  to the house hold income hasn't increased modified wife because she now working a job which gives her barely enough hours to count so she can receive fs to help

i am in a situation involving the eligibility of government assitance for my family i have browsed this channel and it seems to have a deeper understanding of the restrictions and limits regarding things such as food stamps

i am  years old trying to make an income however my mother says that if i get a job our snap and medicare assistance will be taken away from the family 

is my mother telling the turth 


i do not want that money taken away from my family because i will not make enough to support them with my minimum wage part-time job

my mother doesn't make any income we are a household of three (two under  one adult) and we reside in indiana

i understand that if there is an income coming into the household the amount of government assistance we recieve will decrease i also understand that there is an income limit per household that we cannot surpass but i will not make above that limit as a  year old

may someone elaborate on the cirucimstance of which a family will no longer be eligible to recieve our assistance if a teenager is working is there anyone i can contact regarding this situation"

then i get a paper in the mail in june stating that my benefits will be stopped by june th if i don't send my income which was already sent in may i reprinted every check stub and sent it in again well before the june th deadline with a note because i sent them all the first time

 then i waited and waited and waited july th was my reload date and nothing happened so i called they said my benefits ended because they did not get my paperwork in time  which is bullshit since i sent it in practically the same day it had my hourly wage and i work  hours a week so there was nothing missing i didn't get anything else after that i did call and speak to a call center rep who told me she would have my caseworker call me two days ago they never called i called again today and left a message   


what else can i do i am frustrated because i sent everything in like they asked and they still just closed my case i feel like it was someone in the office just closing my case for spite because i have to go to staples to print out my check stubs and i did it both times and mailed it in both times i have had food stamps for a while so its not a new re-certification do they just not check their mail if they get my check stubs would they still just close my case regardless its been over two months without any food assistance and i still qualify for them and my rent increased as well should i reapply or will that delay it more i just don't know what to do"

he asked me questions about my income and the money i received from family members he also asked for my landlords number who is a family member then he started asking me about my child’s father i told them he is in jail; which he is he was in there for  months originally got out for about - months and is now back in there for the last month and a half he went in there for domestic violence against me originally when he served the  months and he is there again because i called the cops on him for coming to my house and violating the restraining order i know the reason i am being investigated is because my income didn’t match my bills so they assume the father is living here and paying but he’s literally in jail although he gets out in a few days 

they came into my house and looked around there was nothing for them to think a man is living here or anyone besides myself and my child my child’s father and i aren’t connected in anyway besides having a child together and the court cases 

the investigator said i could try calling the office at the end of this week to see if i have been approved for calfresh

so my question is is it looking okay for me i have had him come over at times to see our daughter because i don’t trust him to take her alone but he definitely does not live here and doesn’t spend the night when he gets out of jail i may allow it as well are they gonna continue investigating me are they gonna stalk my house and make sure he doesn’t come over when he gets out of jail this is just all so ridiculous and i really really need the help with buying food"
will i qualify for food stamps if i make just above the max income but way less after rent so i make about $ above the maximum income requirements to get food stamps in nj ( people me and my daughter who is under ) but i was just wondering if they take into consideration the fact that i pay rent that would then bring my income below the max
wrong household size have to update concerned i had filed to switch to medi-cal last year from covered california at the time i was living alone i couldn't get a hold of my case worker and gave up until they emailed me in jan  i had a roommate by then and i got a hold of the welfare office that handled medi-cal in my city they asked if i needed food stamps too i said yes i can't remember but i think they just went off my info from medi-cal from the year before where i was living alone i got a letter to update my info for income household size etc my roommate doesn't work they're retired i believe and don't have an income and neither do i am i gonna get in trouble for this not sure how i should go about this but my roommate moved in two months before i got benefits

florida: denied food stamps because of usps employment so they called and took some more information which makes no sense because at the end she says i just want to let you know that you don't qualify for food stamps for the sole reason that someone in the household works for usps which is a government job that's supposedly because the government makes sure that government employees have above the pay amount to qualify for food stamps  i asked her to explain more because we qualified before while he was working there and there was no pay raise and she said she doesn't know that maybe it's something they just started doing so simply because you work for a government employer it doesn't matter what kind of financial situation we're in; it apparently doesn't matter

before we got our approval letter or ebt card we got a letter saying that we don't have to report any new changes until recertification

does this include his new job is it all changes that they don't want reported it didn't provide any more details other than that my sister who also gets fns says not to report the new job until we have to recert in march as that's what she's been doing she said she got two letters from her agency saying they even automatically recertified her with no effort on her part

of course we want to keep receiving fns but i also don't want us to get into trouble and ending up paying back money

i have a business that has suffered during covid in meantime i took over family business when parent/owner got sickthis other biz was even more devastated w affect of pandemic so i'm juggling keeping these entities afloat/dealing w sick parent which has made it harder to focus on work ppp relief etc has helped and we do have some money in the bank

i think our assets in bank are over the limits that i've read but we would qualify based on low self employment income currently and last few years

 income seems like it was near cutoff limit where we would've maybe got something  under fpl this year will be a loss entirely based on business expenses outweighing income
 
so on one hand our household of  has some cash to tide us over for a while but on the other hand we still stress about all of this and while i'm an optimistic person and want to get on track i believe some assistance would definitely be helpful to us and i'm considering the trend here of business/recent tax returns

multiple bank accounts but some are for businesses i ownso operating funds push comes to shove the $ will go to feed my family but i also want to keep my businesses going haha because that will allow us to get back to self suffiency

i guess my concern is an asset limit and maybe some bank accounts being in personal name even though it is used for company purposes

i did get a call yesterday from gain i couldn't answer and the lady left a  minute voicemail basically she was going to ask me if i was employed to let them know and that she'll be monitoring my case i am still not employed she also said that the benefits i'm receiving right now will be in ""good cause"" and to ""not worry about anything"" i asked my sister about the gain thing and she told me it's when you applied for calworks and are receiving it but i am not receiving calworks at all i've checked my cash balance and it's always been $

so what i want to know is if i'm going to have to owe back anything that i received i'm afraid to use all of my benefits and then owing it back later i have tried calling my worker but the call never goes through i've tried maybe  times and nothing thank you for your time"

"[ca] need advice re how to come clean - accidentally committed fraud hi reddit i recently discovered that i have accidentally committed fraud by not reporting income and have been pretty stressed i do intend to ""turn myself in"" and try to come clean but am wondering what's the best way to approach this

a little background: my spouse worked a minimum wage job in the food industry (no tip position) and her hours varied every week anywhere from - hours i am a contract worker so it's always a famine or feast situation and needless to say my income fluctuates a lot

 was a very dry year for me and i only worked a total of  months by the time my spouse and i applied for calfresh for the first time in november  i just took a look at our original application and we put $k for her yearly income and $k for my yearly income both numbers were estimates based on our situation at the time

i am not exactly sure how/why it happened this way but our application was under my spouse's name with her as the main contact she was the one who got interviewed on the phone and got approved etc but i am actually the one handling finance in our household so here comes the problem - i knew nothing about the program and didn't bother to look into our responsibilities soon after we were approved i actually got another job which lasted till mid december my spouse's situation stayed the same the idea of reporting change of income never even crossed our mind

fast forward to  my spouse's situation is still more or less the same but i again worked a contract job from feb to april (did not report) and lost the job due to covid before i went on unemployment in early april (also did not report)

we received a recertification letter recently and that's when i realized that i should have ) reported my ui benefit and ) reported change of income while i had my contract jobs (my income was $ when we applied for calfresh) our  tax filing shows $k gross income which is $k more than the estimate we put in our original application we obviously are not wealthy and had zero intention to cheat the system but am not sure if they'll believe us

our phone interview is scheduled for pm on thursday and i want to be on the phone as well so i can explain the situation as it was only me who had a change of income significant enough to affect our eligibility

where do i even start ui because they certainly see that in their system what do i even say about my contract jobs and reasons for not reporting them months ago we stopped using our ebt card immediately after this realization and will fully cooperate to pay back anything we owe i just don't want this to become a legal/criminal matter and have it on my record

last question - we do not want to be considered for renewal we actually decided to move abroad after the holidays (lots of self reflection during covid) how do i withdrawal/request for our case to be terminated

thank you very much"

"[texas] help me understand my new allotment for the last few months i was staying in a friend's spare room paying no rent or utilities and buying all my own food for myself (household of one for snap purposes) i had no job and was receiving $/month from supplemental security insurance while i was waiting for my disability payments to begin   

my snap allotment was $/month  

my ssi ends this month and my ssdi will begin in june which is $/month  

however i'm also no longer living in a spare room i have a roommate in a house and i am paying half of the rent and utilities my half of the rent is $ and i believe the standard utilities allowance is $  

my understanding is that my ssdi income of $ will get the standard $ deduction giving me a net income of $  

my understanding is that an excess shelter deduction is my actual shelter costs (rent + sua) - (half my net income after standard deduction) so + = $ - (half my net) = $  

and that amount is then deducted from my net in addition to my *actual* rent to detemine my 'final' net income  

that final net income is then multiplied by  to determine the amount i should spend on food per month which if it's less than the $ allotment for my household size is what my benefit amount would be   

to recap:  

 disability income  
-  standard deduction    
-  rent    
-  excess shelter deduction  
=  net remaining  
 of  =    

which means my allotment should be

"california ebt - can the card be shut down if not used often hi all

so i'm relatively new to ebt i got my card near the end of oct  unfortunately i have been sick on and off since getting the card and my appetite has been pretty low i have made small purchases since getting the card every th of the month i get the new deposit my balance is pretty high last purchase was on jan 

someone told me a story they heard from a friend how when they didn't use their card ***i believe it was for about  months*** the card was shut down and they had to go through the process of getting it again not sure if their balance was gone when getting the new card

so my question is ***not that i plan on waiting two months at all*** but this is my first ever ebt and now i'm paranoid because i haven't made large purchases yet

im curious is there a certain length of time or a certain balance on the card if too high that can cause the card to be shut down from not using it in california

i plan on going on a major food shopping spree soon  *also since my balance is high there isn't a daily amount limit you can spend on food is there*"
"meal planning service at meal owl we want to use technology to address food insecurity we are developing an app that would allow food-insecure people to input factors (such as their budget means of transportation food needs etc) and get back a plan that shows the best grocery deals how much it would cost to buy the food and where they should make the purchase  


while we develop our product we want to make sure it is as useful as possible that’s why we’re here we would appreciate feedback or answers to any or all of the below questions


 how do you currently get food

 do you plan a meal first or wing it with ingredients

 what do you consider when you buy food (price nutritional value quantity freshness)

 have you used a meal planner before

 have you ever not bought food because you wanted/needed to buy another product/service

 would you be willing to change your food purchasing habits if you had access to a list of healthier and cheaper food

 do you have any health problems that are related to meal planning but difficult to address (ie finding healthy foods with a heart problem diabetes parkinson’s disease or being old so chewing is hard) what specific difficulties do you face and how could we address those

"[orange county ca] asked for paystubs by ievs ""your case has been identified as having a possible discrepancy in reported income and/or resources  this discrepancy was determined by match of the computerized income eligibility verification system [ievs]""

the county wants me to submit paystubs from work from january to the end of march of this year

the letter concludes that paragraph with ""your employer will be contacted directly if you fail or refuse to provide earnings information""

as i am not working many hours this month; would it be better to not email the paystubs and reapply for food stamps at the end of this month

i'm worried that if i made more than i was allowed to irt it would affect me further applying for benefits during periods i'm not working as much

what upsets me about income earnings is that the county does not seem to account for housing car or phone expenses"

it's very confusing is the temporary eligibility expansion for va snap not in effect anymore it's still listed as effective as of // or is it simply just an automatic denial mistake from whatever coding they have going through these case numbers i left a voicemail to my case worker for the morning but not gonna lie the anxiety and struggle is heavy tonight i'm hoping there are maybe others here who had similar experiences and it ended up being fine and if not- well that changes up going to school in a couple of weeks from now"

"psa: change your ebt pin often there's a huge increase in ebt theft through card skimming tell everyone you know that has ebt to call the number on the back of the card and change pin it is automatic don't need to wait for a live person 

change your pin before your issuance day every month is my best advice it's okay if you forget your own pin  just reset it again 

if you got stolen funds high chance you wont get the full benefit reimbursed if they stole a lot

these fucking thieves knows your issuance date as well as the emergency allotment date they use it the day after its issued often in the am hours at hour places  so just change pin before any issuances"

"what's the process of disputing a denial decision hi there back again i live in oklahoma got denied officially because my income is over the limit and i want to dispute this decision because looking at my budget i have nothing set aside for food each month and my bills go over my income anyway what's the process of disputing and kinds of things would i need to bring to the hearing or whatever to help my case

for example my husband is unemployed dhs won't like that because we can probably qualify for help with childcare and he is able bodied enough to work so would they want proof that he's been applying to jobs how many a week do they want a person seeking employment to apply for 

obviously i won't be able to use debt as a reason that i need foodstamps because that's something i got myself into subtracting my two credit cards and student loans that weren't even factored into my budget my bills still top at  with my take home income being  each month 

primarily what i want to use to cement my need for foodstamps is my vehicle and its associated expenses i live an hour out from my job  minutes from the closest town so having my vehicle is a *necessity* legally i am required to have full coverage on it because it is a car that payments are being made on the catch on the car is that it's in my mom's name with the total payment being $ a month i pay $ of that to her usually over fb pay though sometimes with cash (like once or twice if that) i can bring her if need be to attest to the fact that that's where the money is going but i can't just ditch that vehicle and buy a junker that goes from a to b with money i don't have i need the system to understand that without my car i have *no* income and it's not some luxury i'm choosing over food"

"[ca] calfresh repayment agreement for inadvertent error hello and thanks for taking the time to read

&amp;#xb;

i live with my unmarried partner and our  month old child i decided to apply for calfresh because i'm barely working ( hours a week minimum wage) and have been seeing billboards all around town encouraging people to apply because my partner and i are unmarried i only submitted documents for myself and my child we were approved quickly and i had been using our benefits for about  months i received a call about a month ago questioning a bunch of aspects about my case for instance if i receive undeclared tips (no) if anyone else contributes to rent (yes) they asked me to submit pay stubs for my partner / roommate so i did

&amp;#xb;

shortly after my partner received a notice for ""calfresh repayment agreement for inadvertent household errors only"" at her old address asking her to pay back $ dollars (the entire amount of benefits i've received) it seemed very strange they would send it to her old address and ask her to repay the amount instead of myself i talked to someone at health and human services and they said that because we live together she is a part of my household each of my friends who live with roommates say they do not include their roommates as part of their household i assumed (probably incorrectly) that since we are not legally together this wouldn't be an issue

&amp;#xb;

the person i talked to on the phone suggested we ask for an appeal i plan on doing this if anyone has any advice or insight that would help me it would be greatly appreciated $ is a massive amount of money for us we assumed the money was for food and do not have the cash to immediately pay it all back thanks again"
"question about kentucky dcbs workers hello my family of  were on medicaid and snap in our previous state of residence and applied for the same here in kentucky as soon as we moved the woman who conducted our interview did not seem to like us did not believe the information we gave and kept determining that our paperwork was not valid (ie our lease directly from the landlord was somehow not valid proof of residency and household composition) she said that she would only approve us for one month of $ if we were able to provide her with valid documentation i thought that was odd considering in our previous state we received $ and we are actually making less money now and paying more in rent i am a full time student but i am also a sole care-giver and receive federal work study regardless i made sure to go back and get exactly what she asked for every form every pay stub every bill and i submitted it to them online it has been weeks and no one has looked at our documents yet it is still pending

to return to my question does kentucky dcbs assign specific case workers or is it random is the woman who gave us our interview still in charge of our case or has that been passed on to someone else is it possible to have a new case worker review our case or is my only option an appeal i don't think the interviewer got our information correct and i worry that because she did not like us and my husband got short with her that our case is just going to sit untouched until the last minute she seemed very doubtful of my husband's income the fact that i am a full time student or that we have a child living with us i am not sure why but i assume that was why she gave us a hard time and said we were only eligible for one month of less than $ in snap i've had very little luck finding answers or clarity by calling dcbs myself so i am asking here now thank you"

is this saying that emergency allotments are over dec st for all states or is it referring to other administrative components of state snap programs"
help with florida  i did my recert the day before my date(which was / and i did my phone call on monday / because it said it had a technical verification i hadn't heard anything just happened to check my account and saw it said that i used to get a interview call and i heard they don't make calls anymore it was about child support i called and had it dealt with they said it should process soon my reload day just passed(the rd) it still says technical verification and it still says you need to complete your interview by / i was wondering how long it might take before my card is reloaded or is there something else that i need to do they barely give any information on the phone and it takes hours to get through (i know they are short staffed they have been for a long time) thank you

"psa for anyone that uses instacart and pays with ebt hey all new to the community

i'm in washington state i recently found out that you could order groceries on instacart and pay with ebt while going over the receipt to see the charges today i noticed that i was charged for bags and a bag tax if you guys don't know any person receiving any type of public assistance is exempt from the bag fees and taxes

when i called to speak to them they said they do not offer refunds and that i needed to look at the fine print for this hung up the call then went to create an order to see the fine print this is what it says: "" a bag fee may be added to your final total if required by law or the retailer the fee will be visible on your receipt after delivery ""

i called them back to ask again the next person i got continued to tell me the same thing however after checking on the [seattlegov]( website this is what it says under exceptions:

* the fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) women infants and children (wic) temporary assistance for needy families (tanf) or food assistance program (fap)

the person put me on hold and then came back to tell me that upon review they will give me a refund ""this time"" and all i needed to do was send them an email at the generic 'help' email address if you have used this service check your receipts"

"food stamps for february to be paid on january th per reporting [by cnn]( food stamps benefits for february will be paid on january th because the usda found a loophole that allows them to make all the february payments they had initially said they could only pay % of february's food stamps benefit obligations should the shutdown continue into february 

""the agency initially guaranteed funding for the program which serves more than  million people only until the end of january if the partial government shutdown isn't resolved sooner

the department says it is now using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within  days of a government funding lapse and is working with states to issue february's food stamp benefits -- which are expected to total $ billion -- by january ""

"$ a month in food benefits (michigan) this doesn't sound right to me but i'm really not sure i could be wrong so i wanted y'alls opinion i have an idea why due to unverified rent costs but i'm really not sure i received a letter today from dhs saying that i qualify for assistance but only $ per month

i currently roughly make $ a week  a month and $ a year my rent costs $ per month $ per year leaving me with $ for the year

i also have an electric internet phone bill and transportation costs

my electric bill it's about $ a month $ a year bringing the total money i have to spend down to $

my transportation costs about $ a week $ a year leaving me with $ to spend for the year

phone bill is $ a month $ a year bringing the total i have left to $

internet is $ a month $ a year leaving me with a grand total of $ to spend that year

i don't know what expenses are accounted for when determining what your benefit amount will be but $ per month seems low to mei honestly don't know so i wanted to ask your opinions i saw a link on one of the posts in here about a benefit calculator but cannot get it to work not sure why maybe it's because on trying to use it on a phone

the work you do affects so many in personal ways its my prayer that you understand just how important what you do is and yes i know you can deal with rude and some ungrateful people but you do the right thing because its the right thing and not depending on how this person acts

as someone who suffers from depression and anxiety i know i can be a real asshole to deal with at times and i am blessed people in your field understand not to hold that to me when i lose myself in the moment and may be awkward scared or upset i worked in healthcare directly with the public for  years before i got sick having to deal with people like me and i have an amazing amount of respect for people that are able to

i guess what i am saying is thank you and thank the lord almighty i live in a country that helps me and my family as divided and diverse as i am sure the people on this group are as poverty knowns no race or religion no demographic is immune from it we can all agree that we are blessed and or lucky depending your belief system that we have this safety net please treat your caseworkers with respect and consideration for the magnitude of responsibility they have to make sure people are taken care of

for this renewal she included the same income amounts

"abawad - able-bodied adults without dependents questions hi all

so i have some questions about  able-bodied adults without dependents i currently am in california and receive my cal fresh ebt with no problem ***however i may be moving out of the state to the panhandle gulf coast area of florida*** i know there they may be stricter than california and offer  months to able bodied people without dependents but to continue on you will have to work a certain amount of hours each month to continue to qualify if not you cant apply again for  years

my situation before applying for ebt i was pretty much facing homelessness crashing and burning for a long time struggling to pay bills and have enough to eat anything i never thought i would even qualify for cal-fresh ebt because i thought i only could if i had children  or if i worked a typical  to  job with certain hours per week reaching the quota  but i was a freelancer or did random day jobs where you work the day and are paid cash etc  but i learned the hardway after struggling so long actually no i could qualify and it has been a lifesaver for me and my health  

anyways i digress i found a great deal where i am taking care of someone in their late 's who has vision problems blind in one eye glaucoma in the other he broke his hip a few years ago so i help take care of the property maintain the yard take out trash if any problems with internet home repairs etc i handle it he doesn't have good spatial awareness when driving so i have to help him become aware of when to stop how far in front a car is where to park without going over the curb etc when receiving small printed receipts letters bills etc he cannot see things i have to be his eyes  he can still legally drive as he still passes the vision test at this time but he needs someone with him as he doesnt want to be completely incapacitated by this while still having some resemblance of independence he however cannot drive at night 

so he isnt bed ridden or needing medications every hour  or dependent on me financially in any way he is just someone who needed help to maintain his home etc as well as help with the smaller details of life that his vision issues have been taking away from him  **this is my job how am i paid by having shelter a room a place to stay i dont pay any of the utilities i simply help take care of him the place in order to cover what my rent would be food is my responsibility however and has always been** 

so i'm a bit nervous if he wants to move as he wants me to go with him and we go to a place with stricter  month rules when issuing ebts as i dont want to be in the situation where i was struggling for food previously  yet the work i do takes up a lot of my time but provides me shelter it helps cover any rental cost utilities that i couldnt pay at this time anyway  i have been wanting to get some type of online job just for extra income but i dont know if that meets the ebt requirements per month to continue receiving assistance i dont plan on being on ebt forever that has never been the goal but just trying to get on my feet i'm an artist creative type  so i'm always working on that in some capacity so i have always done freelance things in the meantime 

abawad - so does working in exchange for a service such as working off rent or the work you do that covers rent for shelter but you dont receive any actual money just a place to stay fall into the work category to keep receiving assistance until one is on their feet

does any type of online job meet that criteria as well

any info would be appreciated"

in texas acceptable proof of disability for snap does anyone know what would be considered acceptable proof of disability for a  snap application  i know theres a dedicated form from hhs that a client can give to their physician to fill out but does it have to that form or can it be a physicians letter or a generic disability form  im asking becsuse my physician  has a pplicy about not filling out disability forms  but i need one for my snap renewal and also one for a housing assistance program so i was hoping if i asked him to write a letter or fill out a single generic disability verification form  that i could give to hhs and to the housing program then maybe he would consider doing it  but i dont know if snap only accepts their form and what the housing program will accept

"my just completed re-application for snap benefits in ohio after a  year period where i got benefits added to my card each month during that time without ever having to do a job search type program hi everyonei am  years oldand am living in northeast ohioand recently had to re-apply to continue to receive the snap benefits that i have been getting for the last few yearsand i received word on whether i would still be able to continue getting them after i submitted my application about  weeks agothe response i got back from the odjfs was that i would have to enter a snap e &amp; t(employment and training) program to ensure that i would continue receiving my benefitsand what that entails is what the following  was stated on my noticebeginning in the next paragraph

give your county jfs office enough information to determine your employment status or job availabilityreport to an employer when referred by the county agency unless the potential employment is unsuitableaccept any job offer you receiveunless there is good reason you cannot continue suitable employment until it is no longer considered suitable; the individual is terminated for reasons beyond the individual's control; or the individual becomes exempt from work registration; and must notavoluntarily quit a job of  hours or more per week without good cause orbreduce work hours to less than  hours per week or to a level that equals earning less than federal minimum wage times  hours per week without good causethe problem isi do not have any form of transportation that i could use to to do the programand will not have any for a good long time i believe as wellalsonobody in my family can possibly provide any transportation for me eitheras they are too busy with jobs or taking care of family members to be able to do sothere was a section after that one which began my letter that gives reasons that you can be excused for good causeand here is what it stated about that:

what if an individual has good cause for not meeting any of the work requirements abovegood cause includes things out of your control like illness illness of a family member that requires your presence family emergency domestic violence not having available transportation or not having childcare for children ages  to  these are some examples of good cause if the county jfs office determines that youhave good cause there will be no change to your snap benefits

if you think you have good cause contact your county jfs office as soon as possible but no later than  days after you have been informed that you did not meet a work requirement at the number listed above

soi still have a few more questionsand they are:does anyone knowor who is in a resident of ohio as welland is familiar with odjfswhether or not they provide transportation to the employment and training for youor even bus passes insteadi am thinking since i have no means at all of being able to get there with my own transportationthen i would be excused from having to participate in the snap e &amp; t programbut i am also thinking i won't be if they say that they do provide their own transportationand the last question i have isdoes anyone know if odjfs still gives you the option to do instead just job searches like that had been doing beforewhere you either fill out a sheet with the names of employers that you have contactedalong with number of hours each day that you did the job search activities totalup to a total of  hours a monthor  hours per weekwhich you then turn in at the end of each monthor go on their omj site online and do it on therei am wondering if that changed due to the fact that the odjfs buildings are all still closed at the momentand you can only drop off documents in a bin right by their [doorsso]( anyone can answer all these questions that i have presented here or even just a fewi would really appreciate it:)"

question about reduction in benefits in illinois my relative used to receive $/mo in food stamps he had a redetermination and now only gets $/mo his only income is $ in social security disability he gets assistance from liheap for his electric/heating his rent is $/mo plus he has to pay water sewer phone renter's insurance and car insurance is this change correct
"eligibility question / exceeded reporting limit i live in massachusetts and this is about my parents in fl

so my grandmother passed away from alzheimer's recently and my mother took care of her during the last year of her life as a result she had to leave her job and they were living off my grandmother's social security and food stamps after my grandmother passed (early last year) my mom applied for food stamps and took social security early i (her son) was helping her get by until she got a job as a maid in june  this was enough for her to get by without me sending payments since then i managed to reduce her rent and get her health and dental insurance as well as set up a budget

it's time to renew her food stamp benefits but i'm worried now that not only is she not going to be eligible but that she was over the limits ever since she got her job i think she will be able to get by without food stamps but i'm worried that at some point her income went over the federal limit and she'll be forced to repay if she tries to renew to see what her situation is from what i understand she needs to report a change in income if she's over % of the federal poverty level in fl (she's ) i think she's around $ over that limit

this is her financials now:

rent: $  
electricity: ~$  
phone: $  
water: ~$  
renter's insurance: $  
dog food: $  
gas: $  
netflix: $  
car insurance: $  
health: $  
dental: $ 


her income:

- she earns either $ or $/mo depending on how much work she gets (after taxes)  
- her social security went from $ -&gt; $ recently  



what do i do should i tell her not to renew or is it safe to apply again to see"

"[illinois] i think i screwed up i'm going to attempt to call the office monday but to ease my nerves now

was furloughed march due to covid single and no kids received snap/medical/unemployment went back to work mid june with reduced hours and forgot to report to snap still was receiving ui

i cant recall if i received paperwork of any kind (ive checked the website to see but says my file hasnt even been updated since january) i'm % sure i never sent my redetermination paper back because i had money coming in i assumed my snap/medical was going to be dropped anyways so didnt touch my card after mid august

was furloughed again end of october (yay restaurant jobs) and reapplied for snap got a letter stating i was denied because i was already receiving benefits sure enough i check my card balance and says i have $ (i'm guessing sept-nov)

from what i understand they'll obviously take back april-june because of all the extra ui putting me way over the amount then the rest they'll have to recalculate

it's kind of a kick to the gut because i obviously need it and i know itll come back to everything being my fault was definitely not intentional just been a rough year and cant keep track of everything going on"

"renwal question texas like a lot of people my husband lost his job in march due to covid he was approved for unemployment and received it until may when they suddenly decided he wasn't eligible cut off his benefits and then sent a letter demanding repayment he filed an appeal and nothing has happened with it yet he had to refile it a few times as he would file and then it would ""disappear"" from their system but he now has a confirmation of the appeal when his unemployment ended i applied and was approved for snap benefits (we have one child and i mention that because i know that can make a difference of requirements) my husband got a new job in august but they paid once a month and they hired him right at the beginning of the new pay cycle so he had to work an entire month before getting his first paycheck that first check came in september the same day our snap benefits were dispersed we were still struggling as we had zero income for several months and this new job paid a fraction of his pre-covid salary so i used the snap benefits we were given for september we both had a feeling this job wasn't going to last so even though he had a job i didn't update our case so they gave us snap benefits again for october but we didn't touch them the money remains in the account our suspicions were right the same day the october snap benefits went in they let him go from the new job so he received a paycheck in september and october and then had to pay him once more in october for the days he worked beyond the pay period as well as for the benefits taken out of his previous paycheck that will no longer be available to us since he no longer works there so i know under all circumstances we shouldn't be able to use october's snap

now it's time to renew he's unemployed again he applied for unemployment which was denied as they think they overpaid him for his last claim which is still waiting for the appeal to take place i think we are still eligible for snap benefits starting in november because we have zero income expected in november  i guess because i never updated our case now i'm worried they will deny benefits going forward do you think they would deny snap for not reporting a change even though we didn't use the resources am i overthinking this or is it a genuine concern"

they eventually got it sorted but again said we didnt turn in october's pay because the hours were less i did sent them again along with our housing voucher and bills 

i called november nd and they said the case was closed which i said was not right  they called later and said its being worked on its been worked on since october th i really dont know what to do because we have no money when i call all i get is ""its being worked on"" my kiddo has food allergies so while my husband and i can eat food from the food pantry and backpack programs she cant and its in our file that she has food allergies am i out of luck until they finally finish it

"i think dhs screwed me over i'm a single  year old working part time i'm not in school but live in the rural countryside so not many options for jobs without driving an hour away 

i've been using snap program for many years now to help with eating expenses recently had a re-evaluation in which they denied me saying that i made too much money when i'm barely scraping by 

the thing i found odd was that when i first turned in my last  check stubs they contacted me and said that those wouldn't qualify and i needed to wait til' i could get  more weeks worth of pay to re-verify 

the thing is my first  stubs were below the income limit to qualify and the last  weeks i was getting extra hours for our store inventory so those better hours were only temporary for a couple of weeks 

so basically they saw that originally i qualified but in order to disqualify me (which i know they try to keep people from getting it) they told me i needed another month of pay stubs 

i feel like i kind of got screwed over why couldn't the previous month with ""normal"" hours qualify i think they purposely tried to find a way to disqualify me i could be wrong though if someone could chime in with some expertise or experience that'd be lovely

edit: most of my expenses are car payment insurance and housing while also paying the bills for that"

my family of  will now qualify under income guidelines for snap benefits if it matters i'm  husband  and on ssdi and we have our two grandchildren (middle school age) in our legal custody  the boys have medicaid but i've never tried for other benefits for them  

i've been reading today and see that criteria for snap means you can't have more than $ in cash but it appears retirement funds such as ira's don't count  i don't want to do anything illegal or fraudulent  i've always saved for a rainy day and we received a good bit back in tax refund so have several thousands dollars in the bank  would it be okay and a good idea to put the extra cash into retirement fund  how long in between putting in fund and applying should there be  my reduced salary goes into affect next month

"just got approved for food stamps and it looks like i got double the monthly amount for some reason (colorado) i just got approved for snap benefits and received my ebt card today

it appears that there were two benefit deposits made both the monthly maximum of $ for a total of $ 

why did i get double the maximum amount in my state is it possibly because it's my first month or could it be because i applied last month and they denied me for a reason that was bogus so they gave me last months benefits this month when i reapplied in addition to this months benefits

was this a mistake by chance

both snap and my work screwed up my income verification is there anything i can do these are two separate issues  the first is that snap did not process my income verification for a new job so i was getting full benefits for - months when i shouldn't have been  this was absolutely not my fault the person i talked to when i reapplied even said that it was received but not processed  today i had to call them and found out my account is being investigated for over payment and i may have to pay some of the money back  i absolutely cannot afford to pay back between $ and $ right now i have just started an expensive restricted diet for a health issue (other treatments haven't done much in the past) and i've had my snap benefits cut already  my second issue is that my work incorrectly told snap that i work more hours than i do so my benefits were really low this month i called to ask when my new income verification would upload for the month and they said that it wouldn't be fixed for this month so i basically lost out on $+ in benefits  the woman on the phone said she could put in some kind of an application for underpayment but it sounded like the only way i would get that money back is if they did something wrong on their end  is that true  what can i do about any of these situations

i think they need to do some sort of advance notice rather than leaving people suddenly $ less that month  that would not bode well for him come november if it was his decision and not the usda's (the usda still needs to give notice too)  the home page on the website is updated frequently but hasn't mentioned the $ for - months at least make a decision by a set date rather than keep us guesing and tying up the hhs and  lines"

"[mi] dhs asking for verification of ""unearned income"" because i was on unemployment last year i applied for snap benefits in february and was approved for a whopping $/mo for food stamps i submitted everything they asked for but yesterday i received a letter from dhs stating the irs has reported ""unearned income"" under my ssn in the amount of k+ last year it is asking for verification and redetermination due to this (why) it never asked me for this during initial application nor did the caseworker ask for it during the phone interview even though she did ask about my previous employer *before* i started receiving unemployment and claimed going that far back would not affect determination that she just needed to update information *ig*

i understand after looking into it that the unemployment and the boost were accounted for if you had food stamps while receiving unemployment but i haven't received them since september th the last day of the peuc and i wasn't receiving food stamps until last month so i'm confused as f

what i don't understand is why it is relevant to me *now* especially if i don't currently receive benefits and supplied income from my employer (the last  days paystubs they asked for)

do snap benefits work at subway i’m a university student in minnesota who qualifies for snap benefits through my work-study and i saw some stuff online that snap works for papa murphy’s and subway today i went into subway and asked if i could use my snap and they said no i just need clarification on whether or not i could use my card on certain restaurants
"i’m being investigated for food stamp fraud i got a call on friday from an investigator saying they think my recertification is fraudulent because i and our children live with my ex but didn’t report his income i was unaware that i had to report his income because i thought we were considered separate households

i have been on medicaid since  when i had to leave my job because o hyperemesis from pregnancy with our first child i was in a car accident near the end of my pregnancy which injured my back so badly i’ve been unable to go back to work he’s always been resentful of this (and me keeping our baby in the first place) and insists that i pay as much as i can of the bills because “he’s not my benefactor” 

i ran up debt on my only credit card and had to borrow money from my parents to pay bills after leaving my job in june  in the spring of  i finally received my settlement check which i reported to medicaid we bought a house (also reported) i started going back to school that fall but got pregnant and again had severe morning sickness to the point i had to leave school we broke up shortly after i found out i was pregnant but decided to stay living together because of our daughter i was able to pay off my credit card and stretch my money until about april of  he helped me for a bit until june of  when he lost his job due to the pandemic he suggested i go on food stamps because he could not help me anymore without income 

i applied for food stamps and was approved
he had put our mortgage on forbearance all of this was disclosed during my interview to get approved for food stamps now we were more strict than ever about separation of expenses because we had to buy our groceries separate i paid for my food and for my children’s food and stored it separately as well he was unemployed for  months and paid his share with his unemployment checks i got by with food stamps and the stimulus checks sent to everyone he finally got a contract position at the end of january  and started working from home we continued to split expenses the roommate situation was working fine for us for awhile 

then i find out i’m pregnant from having slept with him one freaking time at the end of november  i decide to keep baby i had been self studying at home for a web dev job and felt confident i could get a job which would allow me to be flexible with my schedule and support my children fully 

during this time time my food stamps are extended twice without them asking for any recertification or interview i am able to pay my part of the bills from being extremely frugal and getting part of the child tax credit which started in june of  i gave birth to our youngest in august of  continued to pay for kids expenses and part of the utilities with child care tax credit and my credit card this whole time mortgage was on forbearance 

finally the county sends me notice that it’s time to reapply for my food stamps i send in my recertification at the beginning of december  ex gets word that the contract position he’s been working is ready to offer him full time employment but that he’ll have to come into the office x /week as an actual employee i tell him if he does that we’ll have to work out a way to keep me and the kids safe from catching covid (kids can’t be vaccinated and i’m high risk) i suggest he wear a mask when around us didn’t think it would be a big deal since he spent most of his time in the basement (his bed and office were downstairs) he refuses and states he’d rather move out and live in his motor home he starts cleaning his stuff out and sleeping in his motor home most of the time which is parked in front of the house in the meantime my food stamps have yet to be approved due to backlog

i finally got a call for an interview at the beginning of last week then this past friday i get another call from an investigator saying i should have reported my ex’s income she accused me of still being in a relationship with him saying we looked real happy on facebook (which is weird cause we have no recent pics together on fb and my profile pic is of me with my baby)  i told her how he had just moved  out and explained we were not a couple

i am very confused about the whole situation and why the county would think i am trying to lie when i’ve been very forthright this whole time it was my understanding that we were separate households due to splitting costs of expenses and no longer being a couple my ex has always insisted that he’s not liable for my expenses and that since i chose to have kids i needed to support them as best as possible

any advice for a situation like this"

anyways i logged into my account on the commonhelp site and while he was added to my case it says under snap he is not receiving benefits because he did not ask/require them forgot exactly what it said and this made me panic because when i had my son the same thing happened when they added him to my case and we ended up not getting any of my benefits for  months even though my case was active etc after the  months and several state work tickets(to fix my account) later my account still wasn't fixed and they had to manually put them on the card after another two months they ended up just giving me a completely different case number and it has been working since then and now i'm worried i'm going to have to go through all of that again except this time my case worker won't be there i don't have her supervisors number because the last time this happened i lived in a different county and had  different people i was calling regularly so i'm at a loss what to do if the th comes and they aren't deposited also the people who are taking over her cases until she comes back is the customer care line who has yet to call me back about this

what do i do and please help"
arizona hot food problem i have no idea what to do i recentcly got approved for ebt in arizona and was told i qualify for hot food ive tried both subway and mcdonalds locations that accept ebt and my card isn’t being accepted the thing is that i was told i would qualify for this and i have sufficient balance on my card i call the ebt number and they say call des and its back and forth with no resolve
reporting income (north carolina) i am late in reporting income i made in a job that i worked at for about eight weeks i thought the food stamps i was receiving were due to the pandemic and a job wouldn’t change that (my ignorance there) thankfully the woman i was speaking to seemed helpful in answering my questions i am a college student so i’m new to receiving these and figuring everything out  is it possible that i could owe money if i only made around $ over that two month period any insight will be appreciated as i’m still waiting to hear back thank you
[or] p-ebt in oregon i’m needing clarifications the numerous articles that i have come across lately isn’t % clear on whether those who make too much $ will qualify for p-ebt or not i know that some districts qualify for reduced lunch regardless of income so i know those will get the p-ebt but what about those from districts who don’t offer free/reduced lunch to all will the ones making too much $ still get the p-ebt too
snap and medicaid (kentucky) when you reapply for food stamp benefits in kentucky do they automatically use the information you turn in to see if you still qualify for medicaid

"when moving to a different city do you get a new caseworker the caseworker i have doesnt seem to like me i have jumped through every hoop shes asked me to shes made me fill out the incorrect forms while knowing i was self employed she made me do the employment one on the paper and letterhead from the owners it stated its commision based and im an independent contractor after a while she said thats the incorrect forms because im self employed and make tips and i filled out those forms and somehow she thought i was getting paid hourly even though she verified it was a self employed job 

then she had me redo the papers again made the owners do another letterhead stating the same things they had stated in the beginning after sending those she said that wasnt good enough then told me she wanted my tax returns which i had no problem with but she had requested them before i was even able to get my transcripts i informed her i had the forms i sent to them but she wanted the actual transcripts with the way my job is irs takes a while longer to finish my stuff that year they did seperate payments so it took a lot longer they couldnt give me a transcript until it was finished it took a couple months before even knowing that it would take that long i told her the situation that i was unable to get the exact ones they needed in a short amount of time 

she cut off my benefits i was lucky i had some back up food buying in bulk and splitting it saved a lot more money a couple months passed and i had ran out of food and was stressing because i had no way to pay my rent and other bills and cover food and my kids well child checks were due i checked and my transcripts were finally available so she made me reapply made me send her the  months i already filled out as well as the  months i didnt have any benefits for they needed an estimated amount its nothing new but it was unnecessary to make me refill out the forms she made me do it day to day income its a lot of writing i called because  months of individual days was going to use a bunch of paper and take forever because she said i couldnt resend the ones since the dates werent the same 

they told me i could have done it weekly or even monthly to make it easier after resubmitting everything she called me to tell me she couldnt use the transcripts because it only had  months at that job which she knew about same position just different location 
and had me fill out even more forms 
so my benefits were cut off for no reason its been issue after issue since more switching of forms and making it difficult for me i have to send income every  months i had a side job it wasnt making me much money but the other job had slowed down and i needed to figure it out i let her know when i was unable to cover my bills i had help covering since it wasnt very often one job i had switched to itemized deductions because i didnt know the amounts i pay would be a deduction actual amounts just makes it less work because it ends with the same results but irs showed the different amount before deductions because thats how it shows in the books and i have to do deductions so i was worried she would make it hard on me because it was deductions on irs the rep i spoke with told me i had the option to do that or send the ledgers 

i kept it itemized but the other job was actual expenses since it was easier to keep track of how many sales i had when i did my review i called and did the interview and was told to send the usual forms i told them i would not be renewing my business license because i was goinf to be able to work more hours because i had someone to watch my kids on other days there were  lines to write for the months on that job  lines for the other job the amount of the month the total amount of before expenses and the amount added for expenses so there was a lot of extra room and using a whole paper for  lines seemed pointless so i wrote on the paperi was just adding the other business because that reason i seperated them and wrote above the income the title of the business actual expenses and wrote the months with total income and no expenses its the same thing they would see if its on seperate papers 

she wasnt happy with that so she made me do it on seperate forms because she said she wasnt able to know that it was different jobs so i filled out the seperate forms this time seperated the months and let her do the math because instead of combining the month in whole i seperated it into the weeks and had to do the one job with only one line on each paper for individual months so instead of one page it turned into  papers then she asked how i was covering my expenses because they exceeded my income and they didnt they dont have forms to fill out so i called to find out what im supposed to send they didnt even know they said usually they just make notes but it was a while since the last time i needed help 

so i asked to speak with her supervisor her supervisor said it was just a computer error even though it was constant problems im sure i pissed her off because she made me do the whole review again this took a few days with everything made me do the forms all over again made me do the interview that i had already done and now today im workinf on getting my daughter in preschool and i was told i have to apply for childcare assistance now im goinf through the process and im on income she had listed im working less hours and making way more than im making because she didnt do the business expenses like she had in the past the rep i spoke with was confused why she would do that so now after i fill out everything i know ill be having to call again and send in the usual forms for the past couple months and im worried shes going to make it hard again because i have to deal with her again so i'm hoping because i moved to a new city i wont have her anymore  

will i get a new case worker or would i be able to request a new one i live in utah"

"worried about losing calfresh benefits starting school again state: california

i recently quit my part-time job (working - hr/week) in order to pursue my master's degree  i applied for calfresh and after submitting and verifying paperwork about paystubs proof of school enrollment and employment verification - i got the max ($/month) for one person  without calfresh i'd have to pull from savings unless i am able to land a part-time job

i am considered a student under calfresh definition and have been approved for work study (through fasfa)

you can also work at least  hours on average per week in order to still be considered a student under calfresh

i read over the calfresh requirements for students and i am concerned about losing or having my calfresh heavily reduced because:

i am interested in working in a lab through my master's program (for work study) but these positions are competitive and space is limited

 if i am unable to secure a spot this semester - how will my calfresh be effected
 will they be checking every month to see if i am holding a job
 what if i cannot work the  hours per week
 i have read horror stories about being forced to payback calfresh benefits because the calfresh office made a mistake/lost paperwork/incorrect filing  i am not in the best financial spot and would hate to have that happen  i have begun storing all my mails from them but i'm still worried i am not used to receiving this much aid from calfresh honestly"

a little about me: covid waivers and unemployment extensions ended in my state last month and it's been chaos ever since my county and more specifically my department (family snap/tanf) has been hit with more applications than we know what to do with then renewals started i've never seen us this behind on processing in my entire  years at the county my task this week was answering phone calls and after  calls tallied yesterday i broke down and cried we finally had overtime approved by management today so i could cope knowing there's a light at the end of the tunnel

"is orange county california following the $ a month increase does anyone know if the orange county calfresh agency is issuing the $ emergency allotment instead of just raising the excess benefit to the maximum level  i never got it and none of my neighbors who already got max benefits got it  the workers at calfresh haven't heard about it either

bassically all year and last year everyone who was getting at least $ in benefits was given enough pandemic extra ebt to get them to the maximum amount based on household size 

&amp;#xb;

however people who started off at the maximum amount or who were less than $ away from that amount were not getting the extra assistance that was supposed to happen when raising everyones amount  

&amp;#xb;

so in april of  the usda and biden (i think) addressed this issue by stating that every household was going to get at least $ a month in emergency allotment  if you were getting more because you had less benefits to start then no big deal however if you were getting less or none because you were already near or at max you get $

  
it seems that the people in orange county haven't been getting it or at least the workers i have talked to haven't heard about it

"i keep running out of food before my next benefits deposit i'm a calfresh ebt recipient  i keep running out of food more than a week before more money is put on my account  unfortunately i think i'm already getting the highest amount a single person can get so i haven't requested more  i know the extra amount that was being deposited for all beneficiaries each month due to the pandemic just ended  i also know there was a permanent increase because of that but the perm increase is still less and i was already cutting it close at the end of each month when we were getting that additional boost  so now i'm running out even a little sooner 

strangely i really don't think i eat much  in fact i do a lot of fasting for both health reasons and to ensure i will have enough food-money to last me the month  it seems the food i usually get which really is pretty basic and healthy stuff a lot of vegetables nuts and general whole foods are becoming more expensive in my area or something  

i don't know if i have a question per se though i am very open to any advice  it's just frustrating and kinda demoralizing  it sucks to need the help in the first place and now i feel like i must eat more than most people when i really don't think that's the case and either end up having to do a full-on complete week-long fast or scrape together some other means to get food

"thank you for a nd chance at life i got ebt for the first time today in cali it's going to save me and my best friends lives we've been living off -$ a day for  years mostly a diet of whole wheat bread eggs brown rice lentils oats and whole grain pasta when there was room in the budget we'd get onions garlic bananas apples frozen vegetables milk yogurt or cheese when we had rare opportunities to spend a bit more we would buy - lbs of meat and try to spread it out over  meals sometimes they'd have special deals on different things or give out free stuff which we would always be on top of

we have to walk several hours to get anything we need and that's only after couponing for hours to find things we can barely afford all during this pandemic it's a dreadful feeling to just survive and walk to feed yourself every day knowing you're not even hitting all the food groups all of my socks are destroyed full of holes and my feet are blistered there was no money for anything extra except cleaning supplies no health insurance so if something went wrong we were screwed the way this has affected my best friend was the worst part running out of money and looking for change to pay for couponed bread and seeing the look on their face knowing it was just gonna be more of this getting fruits/vegetables felt like a luxury all these grains had us feeling sluggish and depressed

now what little we had in our lives was coming to an end too and homeless was looming so i looked for help and found out about the ebt process i applied and got it almost instantly i just got home after finishing it and knowing it was expedited and it's safe and sound and real it doesn't feel real the lady who helped me on the phone was amazingly helpful and kind and continued to help me throughout the process until the end the ladies at the office i went to today were also just as helpful and kind i felt like i was dealing with caring people who had compassion and understanding i don't really have family near me to depend on and i didn't trust i would qualify for any help from government but after seeing how quickly my life just got beyond saved i feel stupid for not getting help sooner the amount of ebt covering our food is probably x the amount we were spending on things for our selves in a month and that's counting cleaning supplies

with ebt covering our food (and being able to buy a variety of vegetables/fruits/meat/etc) we can now afford to buy bikes and find work and save our lives and get out of this mess the  hour walk of doom can now be a half hour commute on the most positive side i went from  to  lbs so i feel blessed for a nd chance"

"arizona - application question i'm trying to help someone that is disabled she is applying for disability but is also applying for snap right now she had to drop a major bank account and switch to capital one since she doesn't have enough money in the account to avoid the bank fees 

when applying is she able to send the statement from capital one  or will they want a statement from the other bank too does she also need to provide any past savings accounts or explain why she moved what she had over (she only gets unemployment for time being so she withdrew it and moved it to the capital one) 

i told her they only look for a statement but she is worried they will look into all accounts and question why she closed that and disqualify her (since it'd be seen as double income)"

"question about cash i just posted this but it got deleted somehow long story short i’m a single mom of  kids in ma i recently reported my daughters dad for abusing me so he is in jail and doesn’t pay child support my other daughters dad is great/pays weekly thru dor

when i applied for benefits (i just got my nursing license and start as an rn in august) the only income i had was my child support

the max benefit i can get being unemployed zero income with  kids is 

because i get “” (incorrect) in child support roughly they give me the remaining that would come out to  and dor sends child support to them not me

this would make sense but now i’m not getting child support i’m just getting the  from the state while they get the child support so what’s the point why count the child support as income if i’m not getting it i’m so confused i basically gave up child support for the same amount but from tafdc

how long how long are ebt cards in california good to use 
income limit so i am renewing my benefits since i got married we are a family of three and i think my husband makes around $-$ a month our rent has went up by $ a month so it’s around  a month that we are paying right now i do not work but i am a student i’m so afraid that they are going to deny our application because he does make around $ a month but most of the money if not all of it goes to bills and not even unnecessary bills just rent power and gas everything is so expensive now and we are going paycheck to paycheck i was just wondering if anyone had any knowledge if they take into account how much bills you pay or if you are over the income limit just a little bit if they get any more information from you it may not be a lot but $ for groceries a month really helps and makes it to where we don’t have to eat just cheap crap all the time times are hard and i’m worried of losing them

"i'm scared that i'm being investigated for food stamps fraud and no one is telling me anything so i had an eligibility renewal interview on monday where they told me i have been getting overpaid for over a year now and that also my numbers don't add up regarding income and all my bills i explained everything how i make ends meet and all and said all the documentation was there so they pulled my file to look at previous years and said there's no documentation matching up to what i was saying she was very stern with me and kept saying that ""i'm taking notes of everything you say"" so that ""if"" the fraud department wants to investigate they'll have records she lectured me about not filling out the application appropriately getting money i didn't deserve and then she told me that when people are dishonest then an investigation team follows up my income and expense situation has literally not changed over the past three years she also was asking me questions about how i pay my car note and my insurance even though i'm pretty sure that's not on the snap application

then she completely changed her tone she said it looks like i qualify going forward but for a reduced amount compared to the past (which is technically the correct amount considering i got too much benefit in the past) and that i should expect a recertification letter by the end of the month

i am just trying to do the right thing i can scrape by if i am disqualified from food stamps but if i have to pay a big fine or do jail time for this i think my life will actually be over

ps i am a college student and i work  hours a week

my questions:

 will i have to repay the benefits i got over the past year she didn't mention this at all even though i asked and i called them later to ask but they said i might get a letter within  weeks if so
 what exactly happens with this kind of discrepancy what is the investigation process
 how can i prove this was an honest misunderstanding or miscommunication i'm scared
 do you think she was just playing good cop/bad cop with me as a test or am i like gonna go to jail

edit to add: one of the major discrepancies is that my parents pay my rent for me i indicated this in the past with a signed letter explaining it as well as an itemized bank statement that shows a bank transfer from my mom for the amount of the rent and me using that same amount of money to pay for the rent the next day i also explained this in person at my original interview now she is saying that i never disclosed it"

how to provide rent cost if living in dorm hi i am a college student eligible for snap i have full financial aid and live in university housing  but to apply for snap the rep said she needed a copy of my monthly rent costs utility bills etc all i had was the housing contract but that wasn't enough does anyone know how to provide this documentation
can’t qualify for snap as a college student no matter what i do (tx)  i’ve applied  times since may  when i found out college students were eligible i just threw in applications and when i was asked for more info i didn’t know what that meant so i just dropped it i didn’t receive phone interviews until maybe the rd time and i missed it i was talking to a friend who said her and her other friend said they just had no money and didn’t work and got it so easily so i applied again saying the same thing (because it was true) &amp; was denied this last time i applied i was asked for verification of employment but said i didn’t send in the right info so i’m giving up on that case i sent in another immediately because that fourth application took a month and a half to hear back when i do interview i always mention i live in a dorm this time the lady was concerned because of my meal plan which is literally just money on the card and optional she told me if we are provided meals then i could possibly not be eligible but nothing is free when you’re in college so that made me mad i also work for instacart here and there and i just started my on campus job i know that you need  hours and i haven’t quite met that requirement i was wondering if it best to just do instacart to get up to at least  hours per week i work almost  on campus consistently what are some other tips so i can qualify because as you can see i really do need them they are really frustrating me and i need help so i can nail the next interview
"[mn] approved  months ago but haven't received my card any other options tl;dr: mn ebt customer service won't send me a card claims they have but after over  months still haven't gotten any of the four cards that have been issued please help i'm tired of angry crying and waiting on hold

sorry this is a long one but i feel like the details are necessary so you guys understand that i've tried everything i applied for snap for the first time in my life in early november  and was approved on november th the system shows that my first card was issued on the th and the lead time is supposed to be - business days i never got the card

after waiting a couple weeks on december st i called the ebt customer service line for mn to see what was up they verified my address multiple times and said i should've gotten it by now but the mail could be slow i live in a populous suburb and have been receiving other correspondence from the county/state in the mail within - days they said i could either wait a little longer or cancel and re-issue a new card i waited but i then decided to call and request a new one on december rd 

december th i called again because i still hadn't received either card they verified my address again and said that the only option was to wait or cancel and reissue the card again so i talked to the local post office and they couldn't find any mail that was sent to me from the ebt servicer i waited another week and called again on the rd to have a third card reissued (i found out that each time they do this they've been charging me a $ fee too btw) so i waited again 

on january th i still hadn't received any of the three cards they issued i was fed up and decided to call my county case worker she tried to be as helpful as she could and checked into some options but due to covid they won't let me pick up my card at a county office like they apparently used to in these situations she said my only option was to call and have them reissue a fourth card called again asked if there are any options to track the parcel and even offered to pay for priority mail but the rep said this wasn't possible they also said if i have it sent to another address the mail will just get returned as undeliverable the rep said that the cards are automatically issued so it's not like a person is physically sending it to me so i had them cancel and reissue the card again 

now it's january th  and i still haven't received any of the four cards that have been issued clearly there's a technical issue or something but nobody can do anything about it i have almost $ sitting in an account that i can't use and my savings are pretty much depleted at this point

"los angeles county ebt double repayment letters hello

sorry for the slightly long setup but it's relevant i promise

in late april this year i was lucky enough to find a job that paid more than the income limit i uploaded my pay stub online and was told that it was too late for them to cancel the june $ i received a letter on / saying that i needed to repay $ and that could be debited from my ebt balance i sent the letter to the central cashier in la cienega and it was confirmed they received it and would process the $ debit

then come july and august they send me another $ in august the county office tells me that my income is over the limit and to submit my pay stub online so i do then at the end of august i receive an electronic saying that my income is over the limit and they will stop my ebt in october but of course i need to repay $ for september because of administrative error

i receive a self-addressed yellow envelope from my local field office where my case is overseen asking for repayment marked attn: cashier on thursday so i fill out the form which looks different from the one i received in may but the case number is correct i mail it out on friday morning 

come friday afternoon i receive another letter this time one that looks like the repayment letter from may that matches my electronic notice it tells me to mail my ebt debit permission form to la cienega    


my two questions are:  


 if i mailed the ebt consent form to have $ debited to my local office do i still have to fill out the repayment form to the central cashier in la cienega — are they different forms for the same purpose or completely different forms and i will have $ debited 
 should i call my local field office's customer support to inquire about this or the central cashier's office to ask

thank you"

"ca - income limit question hi everyone two-part question for you 

can someone explain what mce/bbce income limits means when i looked up ca income limits for calfresh i see there are two different income limits for a single person the first income ceiling is % of the poverty level which is $ while the mce/bbce is % of the poverty level at $ why are there two different figures and which is used 

specifically i'm curious if i will still receive calfresh i was on unemployment extensions since first applying in june ' my benefit was $ a week and i received the $ federal supplement i was approved for $ a month (and have been receiving the max amount of $/month) now since all extensions have expired as of last week i reapplied for a new ui benefit year i have qualifying earnings and because of the timing of the original claim (it was on the cusp of a new quarter) i'll actually be receiving a higher wba from ui of $/week which is roughly $ a month a little more based on the way calfresh calculates will this disqualify me from calfresh based on the % i will be over but based on % i will still qualify my rent alone is $ so i'm just trying to mentally prepare if i'm no longer eligible 

thank you so much"

now i'm in september  i havent used the ebt card since i started working end of june because i thought that because i mailed them my info/income that i would be making that my benefits would stop but i get an email asking me to "" renew my application so my benefits do not stop"" the next day i get a call from a case worker asking if i could complete my renewal application over the phone i tell her that i am not eligible for calfresh benefits anymore because i am working she asks me to complete it anyway so that i am confirmed denied stupid me i quickly try to get it overwith because i am at work i answer her questions and even confirm my income that i've recently made from my job for the last  weeks

few days pass by i get an email to check my enotices on calwin i havent logged in a while at this point because i have not been utilizing my ebt card and thought i stopped my benefits i log in and see that i have still been receivng benefits after june when i reported my wages i check the enotices and  see the letter of denial as expected but i also see this enotice (please see attached)

has anyone else received this enotice or know what it means am i being investigated for fraud or is it just a notice that they checked my work records just to determine my eligibilty it really sucks that i am finding this out on a weekend because i have to wait until monday to call a caseworker and get this straightened out it's making me kind of anxious having to wait if anyone has the answer or can put me at ease i would greatly appreciate it

"calfresh fraud questions new here i recently applied for and received calfresh benefits after about a month i got notified that they were being revoked because my qualifying child no longer lives with me the child does in fact live with me so i filed for an appeal had a hearing the county told me during the hearing what specific documents i needed to submit and i have since submitted them i presume that they will reinstate my benefits but who knows how this stuff goes 

now for my life story and questions 

i am mid divorce my ex is somewhat unstable my ex has claimed our child to receive benefits too we recently went to court and the court ordered that i am to have sole legal and physical custody of the child the order states that the child is to have about ten hours of supervised time with the other parent this seems very straightforward that i should be the one that can claim the child for this purpose

i got a giant packet from the county that had notes of various events in my case and includes references to claims made by my ex spouse about the child custody the timing of the statements are such that that they were made to the county agent after the date of the court order to me this seems like a clear case of my ex spouse committing fraud to the county

my question is if there is anything i should do to report the fraud apart from doing what i need to prove that i should receive the benefit  i have provided documentation that shows the custody order and i expect it to be clear should i just wait for the county to get back to me  should i report the fraud somehow  does it sound like this will get sorted out fairly

i do not want to report my ex for vindictive reasons but they have been making many many false accusations about me publicly partly because of un treated mental illness my goal is not to get them in trouble but i feel like i need to be addressing these fraudulent issues when they can affect me and my child

any thoughts  thank you"

"maine - work requirements clarification hello

i really hate to bother asking here but i’ve not been able to find very much helpful information on this subject myself so here goes

me and my wife have two children aged  and  and we’ve been received snap benefits for the past year or so my youngest is turning  this month and i received a notice about work requirements 

i am currently employed part time and work between  and  hours a week and that is the only income that is counted by snap the rest/bulk of our income is exempt

my wife stays at home with the kids and they are both homeschooled 

some of the information i found states that i have to be working at least  hours a week to be eligible for snap now that we don’t have a dependent under that age of  and some of it said  hours a week or be making at least the federal minimum wage x 

i plan on calling as soon as i have the time but figured i’d try to seek more information so i can better understand it before speaking with someone

i don’t think we are exempt from the work requirements unless i’m mistaken any information anyone might have on this would be greatly appreciated"
