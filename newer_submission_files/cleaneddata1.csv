"tax refund | self-employment missouri

will i have to report my tax refund since it will cause me to have more than the maximum allowed to still receive benefits in my checking account? my renewal is at the end of april, so will having that money in my account affect it?

my husband has his own business and sometimes he doesn't bring home a paycheck. this month he didn't bring home two paychecks (paid weekly). when this happens, do i inform them, and will they increase food stamp benefits for those times?

"tips for remaining positive and helpful as a snap worker? i've been a snap caseworker for almost two years, and it hasn't gotten easier. without going into it, i always feel genuinely physically ill going in to work thinking about people who will get denied help due to failing to meet an exemption or just making slightly too much. even when talking to people who are eligible, i feel gross asking for so much personal info (i know that's just the job, and i do it, but it still feels uncomfortable). 

how do you remain hopeful or help others feel hopeful/respected, even with all the invasive questions and denials? do i just have the wrong mindset? do you have any perspectives/tips for boundaries? maybe i'm just in the wrong line of work, but i'm still really trying. please remove if not allowed.

"when can i expect my card? (georgia) 

according to my georgia gateway account i have been approved for food stamps for well over a week now. they sent the letter of approval a week ago and it only just arrived yesterday. however there's no notice on my account stating that the card has been sent yet, and i've not received one. 

i'm just curious because i'm having to balance finances very carefully in order to make it work until the card comes in. does it normally take more than a week? should i be expecting closer to a month or more?

"complex situation snap question so my wife and i live in georgia and have two children and are in need of financial assistance. we recently applied for snap, however. i am not our son’s biological father. his biological father is not on the birth certificate and my wife isn’t certain where he even lives at this point or how to contact him. we do not want to receive child support as he sexually assaulted my wife and it caused her to conceive our son. we do not want him in our sons life as we don’t want our son to be potentially harmed by him. will us not wanting to pursue child support outright disqualify us from eligibility or is this grey area an exception?"
"extremely low bmi and expedited food assistance eligibility am i the only one who feels that extremely low bmi should be an important determining factor in eligibility, especially when it comes to expedited benefits?

my bmi is about 15; i am 5'6"" and weigh 95lbs. i am 28 years old. i know that my bmi is not quite at fatal levels yet, but it's sure getting close and has been dropping pretty rapidly as of late.

&#x200b;

from here on out, most of this post is going to be detailing my application process with access florida as well as giving some medical background to my situation. i'm also probably going to vent quite a bit, so feel free to skip to the end for a tldr.

&#x200b;

**my income & access florida application history:**

i've been denied expedited benefits by access florida twice now at this point. i've still yet to receive any form of benefits from them. the first time i applied, i put down that i had an income. i had just started working in online transcription. apparently, i picked the worst time in history to do so. it wasn't bad at first, but the work started to dry up very quickly. i began to see murmurs of discontent on the forums. everybody was complaining about a lack of job availability and lower pay rates amongst the few jobs that were available. most were attributing this phenomenon to the website's rapid improvement of their ai-generated transcription services, which are much cheaper for clients. then i saw a lady who claimed to work in medical transcription (which is what i'd hoped to graduate myself into) posting on those very forums stating that she usually comes to this website looking for side work, but that her medical transcription work had been drying up so much recently, she was now primarily coming to our neck of the woods for a main source of income. she also claimed that this was due to ai's rapid improvement in her field.

this was when i decided i needed to find a new means of income. i can still work on there to get myself some pocket money for the week, but that is all it's good for now. i'm sure it's only going to get worse if ai is now able to accurately transcribe complex medical terminology. the human side of this industry is clinging on for dear life and has no future sustainability, in my opinion. i'm not sure what i'm going to do for future income now, but i know that i should choose carefully. i can't exactly afford to take warehouse jobs like i did in my younger days, i would burn way too many calories in a labor-intensive work environment such as that. i tried working as a picker at walmart about a year ago, and i actually had to stop working on my third day because i was suffering from sudden bouts of tachycardia and getting very short of breath while on the job. i highly doubt this was due to any kind of mental reason such as anxiety, as my mood on the job was very optimistic and i was actually somewhat enjoying the work. i've also never had a history of panic attacks or any issues like this back when i was younger and healthier. it seems to be a health issue that pops up when my weight dips below about 100lbs. my experience at walmart prompted me to obtain medical coverage as soon as possible in any form i can get it, something i probably should have done sooner. i've now got that medical coverage, but my first appointment with my selected pcp is not available until jan 23rd next year.

so what happened with my access florida application throughout this? at first, they told me i was eligible for expedited benefits. they then retracted that statement of eligibility and wound up denying my application entirely when i couldn't prove my income. income that i foolishly reported based on speculation of how well i thought i would do this year, only to have the transcription rug pulled out from under me by robots. okay, fine, but why deny me entirely? assuming i can't prove any income, shouldn't that only increase my eligibility for expedited benefits?

to that end, i've now reapplied on access florida while reporting no income, just to see if i could possibly get expedited benefits this time. i've temporarily stopped doing any transcription work, as i just want to see if access florida will give me benefits under any circumstances. a friend of mine has been graciously helping me cover food expenses in the meantime, i wouldn't have done this if he couldn't afford to help me over the next couple of weeks. apparently this time i'm not even eligible for expedited benefits right out of the gate! there wasn't even any time for someone to review my case, just automatically determined that i'm ineligible. i also just got over covid, which certainly did not help. i lost another 1–2lbs throughout the ordeal, so logging back into access florida after getting over it and seeing that i'm not eligible for expedited benefits this time was kind of the catalyst for me making this post. the only possible reason i could see for this is because i own the house that i live in, which is a homesteaded property. it is my livelihood, not a means of income. not sure why this should make me ineligible.

&#x200b;

**why i feel this is wrong:**

knowing that people who have much more fat stores on their bodies to help sustain them are collecting benefits while i'm not getting a dime as i steadily disintegrate is utterly frustrating and quite frankly, sounds like a symptom of a broken system. i have an appointment with my doctor jan 23rd next year (soonest i could get in) to help figure out why i'm losing weight, but i know i'm not eating enough calories lately as i simply can't afford it. in the meanwhile, extra calories would really help to *keep me alive*. i've lost 8lbs in the past two months, dropping from 103 to 95.

i highly doubt that most others receiving these benefits are actually at risk of dying any time soon, but i feel i certainly am. bear in mind that *i don't think this at all invalidates their need for said benefits*, but shouldn't individuals like myself get a bit of priority? or at least not be *rejected entirely*? let alone the fact that i'm probably so malnourished, the longer this continues, the larger my risk for refeeding syndrome upon receiving these benefits becomes.

i also understand that bmi is highly criticized as a metric for health, but i don't think it can be denied that extreme outliers like myself (say, a bmi under 16 or over 40) have severe health risks associated with that number. have a look at what true starvation looks like in countries like somalia, i doubt most people there have healthy bmis and they are literally dying of starvation.

&#x200b;

edited to add: my main reason for putting forth this logic is due to empirical evidence that bmi is indeed an important factor in death due to starvation, such as this:

from the national library of medicine:

""many empirical studies have observed the point of death of people from starvation and have concluded that once an individual reaches a bmi of 12 the probability of recovery, even if the subject is re-fed, is virtually zero""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3529354/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3529354/)

if that's to be believed, i would argue that the line should certainly be drawn somewhere, when bmi reaches dangerously low levels. i don't think that high bmi counts should disqualify anyone, but extremely low bmi counts should almost guarantee approval. if it almost meets the criteria for feeding intubation, why not for food assistance?

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

**closing notes:**

i don't plan to use these benefits for very long, i don't believe it's fair to the rest of society to mooch off of everybody else for long periods unless the beneficiary is disabled or somehow unable to resolve/improve their situation with time. that is not the case for me, i will be able to stand on my own two feet again at some point—but i would have thought that situations like mine were the reason these benefits were put into effect in the first place, not for someone who has been living off government assistance for the past x years and has no plans to change that or better themselves anytime soon.

anybody else have a similar experience to mine? am i just in too much of a minority being underweight in a predominantly obese society? am i just being biased? am i wrong in anything i'm saying here? i can see how this post may come across as elitist or entitled, but it's just getting really sad stepping on that scale every day and watching myself disappear. i do not want this. i am not anorexic/bulimic, nor have i ever been.

any additional advice would also be much appreciated. i've already shifted my focus of whatever foods i can afford to calorie-dense foods and eating more meals throughout the day in smaller portions as opposed to trying to stuff many calories down in one sitting and then not eating for hours. i've been trying to physically rehabilitate myself into a more strength-focused, muscle-building exercise routine. is there anything else i can do to help remedy my situation in the meantime?

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

thanks to all who took the time to read this essay of a post, and i'd be grateful to hear any insights or opinions you may have on this matter.

a tldr for those who didn't read (i don't blame you, lol): should extremely low bmi (under 16) in conjunction with low/zero income be an immediate qualifying factor for food assistance, namely expedited food assistance? also, do you have any advice to help me gain or at least maintain my body weight right now while i wait to get to a doctor? at what point should i consider hospitalization?"
"how likely is it that my food stamps will continue after my one time payment has ended? i applied for the food stamp program last month and recently received a letter stating that i’m eligible for the program. the letter states that i will receive a set amount for this month and a set amount for the rest of the year.

i called the office because i had to set up a pin and the person stated that the application is being processed and anything else they needed they would call me. the person also said it was an emergency one time payment.

i’m in new york city and my question is if the letter states that i will receive benefits for the rest of the year why did the person in the office tell me the application process is still ongoing?"

thousands of alaskans who depend on government assistance have waited months for food stamp benefits, exacerbating a long-standing hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic, inflation and the remnants of a typhoon that wiped out stockpiles of fish and fishing equipment.

the backlog, which began last august, is especially concerning in a state where communities in far-flung areas, including alaska native villages, are often not connected by roads. they must have food shipped in by barge or airplane, making the cost of even basic goods exorbitant. around 13% of the state's roughly 735,000 residents received supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits — or snap — in july, before the troubles began.

"calfresh and federal shutdown | benefitscal may be unavailable today if you're not a ""keeping up with the news"" sort of person, you may be unaware that congress is currently fighting over next year's budget. the federal fiscal year starts october 1 - so congress needs to agree on a budget (and biden needs to sign it) before then, or different parts of the federal government stop working or making payments. 

the ca dept of social services has announced that if congress has not reached agreement on or before september 20, they intend to issue october's benefits a few days early to make sure they will be distributed without disruption due to the federal situation. they have requested permission from us dept of agriculture to make this early distribution but have not received a response yet. 

the letter is here:

https://www.cdss.ca.gov/portals/9/additional-resources/letters-and-notices/acwdl/2023/cl_9-15-23.pdf?ver=2023-09-15-141520-273

tldr: the plan is to issue all october continuing benefits on september 28 and 29. people will get their benefits early, but will not receive another benefit load until november. if the budget situation is not resolved in october it is not clear that $ will be available to fund benefits for november. 

please keep in mind that this is a contingency plan, not something that's guaranteed to happen. congress seems to play ""chicken"" with the budget every year and people getting freaked out seems to be part of the game. cdss hasn't directed counties to make announcements to clients yet; but they've posted this on their public website, so it's not really a secret, either. 

other states are likely working on the same problem, it's a federal issue that will impact all states.

"will this disqualify me? ca i have an oddl specific question.   


i am currently receiving both snap and medical. my mother is in the process of being screened for low-income senior housing. she does not have any consistent income, and the woman handling her case advised her not to make any deposits for the next several months. she is selling her car as she can not drive anymore and asked if the check could be made out to me so that i could deposit it in my bank and give the money to her as she needs it. but the amount would be well above my income limit to qualify for snap and medical.

my concern is, would this somehow flag me and disqualify me for benefits? the money would not be mine to spend, and would not be in my account for more than a few months, but i don't know how the vetting process works and if the state would be notified about it or if it would come up somehow. my next application for snap and medical won't be for some time, and i would like to help my mother but i can not afford to lose my assistance."

(texas) | student loan refund (tx) | online school (tx) | change report delay tx | something non-food got charged on my snap card. i’m curious how common overpayment is on texas snap. i had a hell of a time last year applying. got denied about 2 times before getting approved. since september of last year i had a pending application, that eventually got approved because the hospital here in town put in a medicaid application in for my son, and got approved the next day. 

got my first deposit early january, it was $1,700 in stamps. initially, i thought that was weird and assumed it was pro-rated from applying back in september. backpay. 

the only way i can justify the $1.7k is that when i initially saw i was approved, i saw it was ”approved” back in september, with a renewal date in february. which later updated to starting 02/01 with renewal in august. the amount, the math, amount of months, it added up and that’s why i assumed it was correct. but there’s definitely an error.

now, i’m thinking there has to be an error in the system. i got my usual deposit on the 26th of $506 (my first deposit, outside of that random $1.7k at the beginning of the month), which is the amount that i’m to get each month, which is fine and i’m more than okay with that. however, the next day, i got another deposit, which was in various deposits adding up to $1,251. that’s not right. especially with a family of 3. 

i’m obviously going to call because there has to be an error and i’m not trying to commit fraud or get benefits that don’t belong to me. i’m wondering if anything like this has happened to anyone here and what the outcome was?

 this wasn’t deliberate on my part, like i said, i’m not trying to commit fraud. has to be an error through texas hhsc, and monday morning i’m calling them. 

thanks!

today i had apparently missed a phone call from the texas health & human services. they didn’t leave a voicemail. i went onto yourtexasbenefits and noticed that our snap was increased to $682/mo. 

before this increase, we recently had our renewal approved and getting $649/mo. 

anyone know the reason for this random increase?

so i’m going back to school monday, and was told by someone on 211 that my benefits shouldn’t be affected since i have a child under the age of 6. totally fine. my benefits renewal got approved today and i’m totally psyched. i just need to report going to school and having the proper documentation and then just send it in. 

my question is, i am using federal loans to go to school and i usually have funds left over during my terms. i usually take it out to buy clothes or things for the holidays. do i need to report the student loan refund to snap? 

thank you! this sub has been extremely helpful as well.

how does going to online school effect snap benefits in tx? i’m married, have a child and i have a part time job. my husband doesn’t really work, does uber occasionally. together we make maybe $1,500/mo. i’d like to go back to school and finish what i had started. i applied for fafsa and my efc was 0. i’m just wondering how this would effect our benefits?

a little over a month ago, i had put in a change to my snap benefits, of a pay increase. my change report hasn’t been viewed or anything, just sitting at “sent”. original pay reported was $10/hr. new pay is $12.50/hr. 

should i call them and let them know of the change? or just wait it out?

like the title says, something non-food was charged to my snap card. 

when we were checking out, i had this coupon for food items, and everything for the coupon at checkout. there was an error with one of them, and the checker saw i had the right item and fixed it. note, the checker didn’t know we were using snap or anything. she did something, but i was surprised when a $1 hot wheels car was charged to the card. usually when i have non-food items on the same ticket, i charge the snap card and then the remainder on my debit. that’s just how it’s always been. 

i’m just perplexed by what happened. i wanted to come on here and ask if i’ll get in trouble for this error. i’m just worried i’ll get in trouble for this. i’m not trying to commit fraud, especially when it comes to a $1 hot wheels car. so, will i get in trouble?

edit- i’m in texas."
requirements what are the requirements for a single non working mom of a 11 year old to get food stamps? let’s say they cannot get government disability & cannot work currently due to sleep disorders & cptsd/other co existing disorders. do they need to get a medical note from psychiatrists? is there a way around somehow?
"no benefits, sacramento, ca branch is closed. my proof of income was required to be submitted right at the start of the shutdown, the office is closed and they stopped funds to the card.

what can i do to contact them?"
"some items not covered - what to do hey! i'm sorry if this is a silly question but i thought you all could help!

i just got an ebt card for the first time (calfresh, california). if i am buying a variety of items for the house, and some arent covered, how do i approach that? for example, if i go to target and buy groceries plus cleaning supplies and paper products, do i need to do two seperate transactions for eligible and non eligible items? or, if i do it all at once, will the system know automatically what is covered by ebt, let me pay with my ebt card, then give me the remaining balance to pay with another method?

hope this makes sense. i have major anxiety so i would rather know what to expect before i use it for the first time. thank you so much!!"
"[fl] loss of income form and paystubs - is uploading them enough? hello. i am in florida, and i am aware of the slow turn around for benefits. i applied in early july and just the other day got a letter to send over loss of income and a month of paystubs, due in early september. my question - is just uploading the documents into document center page on my account enough? i'm an extremely anxious person, and i would be devastated if my case gets closed because i didn't send this info in the mail or fax, or call to let the office know they are uploaded. 

also - does the loss of income need to be a personal letter from your old employer? i uploaded my offboarding packet i received my last day of work, but its pretty general. it has my name, employee id, department id, and reason for leaving. and then a bunch of information regarding insurance coverage and my status for rehire in the future. 

thank you for the response. i do not want to clog up the phone lines if i don't have to."
"apparently i owe a lot of money to the ebt program. so i've been on food stamps at the start of lockdown/covid. always been under the threshold for a family of 4. sent in my pay stubs whenever i got a raise, reapplied every year. just got a call at work today that i've been receiving benefits i'm not entitled to for three years. my head is still reeling. i've been assigned an investigator and am supposed to set up a meeting with him. i reported everything as required and was still approved. so i don't believe i am in the wrong here and i dont think i should be tequired to pay as this seems like a mistake on their end and they are trying to recoup funds. has anyone else experienced this situation before? i owe like upwards of 10k at this point. any advice or insight would be incredibly helpful."
"can i get food stamps for my boyfriends daughter? so my boyfriends child lives with us half of the time. i am reapplying for food stamps in michigan. when i tell them i care for a child who isn't my own, will i need her social security # for that or will they give me extra money without it?"
"ebt cards not accepted at every grocery location? hello, i went to a publix grocery store near my house and my ebt card transaction was declined ""request not authorized"". i bought some fruit and bogo cookie dough.

"question about out of state college students i‘m currently enrolled in a college at nyc, and the living cost is out of my budget. i’m already getting so much loan for each academic year. after realizing that i’m actually eligible for food stamps, i felt relieved since that’ll be less of a burden for my family and myself. 

i was just a bit confused how the application process would work for me since i’m a legal resident of georgia but i’m applying as a student in nyc. which state do i submit my application to?"

"can someone explain why the only social services we get are tied to working? | can someone help me understand why i can't reply to my earlier post? also how can i appeal my snap benefit, i really need it? please help! i seriously don't understand how and why and when it became the norm to require poor people to be working in order to to qualify for partial benefits for the already severally meager and undervalued snap?

i am not sure how or why my previous post was locked but apparently talking about our poorly ran social services is now political? and if it is, so what? i mean everything is political, no? so if i complain here and get some moral support and advice... that's bad now? crazy smh

anyhow can someone please help me, i still need help figuring out how to qualify for this snap program. i lost my job recently and they denied me benefits unless i am working. the thing is i'm looking but i'm also unwell rn, so that makes it hard. i literally have nothing and was counting on them to survive this month. now what am i suppose to do?

edit: i also like to thank everyone who responded to my previous post! i'm sorry i couldn't reply as they locked it before i could smh. i read all your responses and appreciate your kindness and understanding."
"did not receive snap in 30 days so i applied for snap a month ago and was told i'd be contacted within 30 days if i rceieved benefits or not and was told i'd get a call to schedule an interview. however neither of those things have happened and  my 30 days ended yesterday. what do i do now. i'm going to call them on tuesday regardless but is there anything else i should know/do?

thought i reported change of new job for snaps and did not! help! i've been working since sept 2022. i thought i reported the change but i must have not sent it. it said change canceled when i went to check if i needed to renew my benefits! i just reported the change. i don't know if i filled it out correctly or not. should i call them??? or just wait and see? i don't think i make enough money to not qualify for the amount i receive but i have no idea how all this works... i am in tx
"wanting to apply for snap in mo but i don't want to violate any laws. i live on my parents property, but i have a tiny home and i only use their home for meals once or twice a week because they're disabled and limited on funds themselves. as title says, i'm really just trying to follow the rules here.   
my parents allow me to live on the property with my girlfriend in a tiny home. we live about 500ft from them, and i can walk over with full access to their home for showers, bathroom usage, and kitchen usage. both of us are unemployed, and we've been struggling to find work. they're okay with us taking from the pantry (sparingly), and they would *never* apply for assistance themselves, so it's not life-or-death, but we can't hardly have balanced meals ever.   
though they won't admit it, they're not in the financial position to provide for all the adult people on the property, and i don't think they need to apply if i can just get help for the two adults i feel i am responsible for; me and my gf. so the big question is: would we be eligible for snap?

(yes a bad moment between friends years ago :) ) ideally i would not be living in his home however with covid and my landlord selling his building this was the most practical option. we do not buy food together and he does not support me and the kiddos financially. this arrangement is his way to ""help"" currently but now i am confused as to if he will be counted against me and i will no longer be eligible for foodstamps and will this get in the way of my other child and my medical. i am beginning to feel that this living arrangement will harm me more than do good. i am confused how to fill out my renewal in that i do not understand if i put him down as in my household, do i put how much money i pay for rent or do i need to discuss his mortgage payment and put that. i know he will not give me his social etc. i am a separate household in all other ways. do i just drop foodstamps. please help me in regard to what is the correct way to handle this. thank you."

"unknown decrease in benefits i got a letter that says i am no longer going to be getting $156 and will be getting $82 going forward. my income hasn’t changed, i used to get medicaid but now get medicare. i now have to pay copays and for my medication. on the letter saying that my benefits are going to decrease it says i pay $124 in rent which is not true and my paper work shows the actual amount i pay. it also says that after the deductions that i have $500 left for the month which is also not true. 


i called my local office and the lady said that those are the numbers they go off not the actual numbers that i submitted. i asked for explanation and she just yelled at me and told me that what i was asking for would be fraud. all i asked for was an explanation as to why i was getting a decrease and why they don’t go off the amounts i actually submitted. she said i could ask for a hearing but the ruling wouldn’t be in my favor. 


has anyone had this happen to them? does anyone know why i would be getting a decrease? this doesn’t make sense to me so if anyone as any explanation as to why it would be greatly appreciated. also i live in new mexico if that is helpful."
"still no food stamps (2 months now) | recertification not processed/no food stamps this month hey, i posted earlier this month about my nyc foodstamps/cash assistance case. i did my  recertification in july, got stamps in august, yet nothing for september and now no pending food stamps for october. 

to recap, i went in person, waited for the supervisor, they were dismissive and told me someone would do it by that afternoon and i would get my food stamps by the end of the week. 

i have called 3 times now to the hra call center to complain, they said they were going to escalate it to the supervisor & contact the center. tomorrow is sunday, i have no food stamp payment for the month of october. 

i am also worried i won’t get backpay of the food stamps i didn’t get for september. 

i still get the cash assistance tho, but it’s literally $150 for 2 weeks, and i usually use that for my light & internet bill (which i am now behind on) but now i have used it for my daughter’s almond milk (she’s 1 and has a milk allergy) and her dairy free yogurt & “cheeses” in order to be able to feed her. 

i have resorted to posting all my personal items i,e: my laptop, ipad, bf’s game console & etc for sale in order to make ends meet. 

my case says it’s active for cash assistance, food stamps & medicaid. but the recertification hasn’t been updated to the next 6 months. 

any caseworkers/similar situations have any suggestions on what else to do? i want to go again in person on monday, but i am feeling hopeless at this point. haven’t been eating, running low on milk again, getting desperate now.. tyia 😟🩷

i got a notice for my recertification on july 1st or else i could lose my benefits for august. i filled out my recertification & submitted all the documents on july 5th & got my food stamp benefits for august so i thought everything was fine. fast forward to now (september), i didn’t get my food stamps for this month, just the cash assistance. i called and they told me the center hasn’t processed my recertification but that they see all my documents & recertification paper, they filed a complaint for me. 

i don’t have enough money for food to make it through the week & i don’t have enough money to buy my daughter’s milk for this week. 

is there anything i can do? i’m planning to going to the center on monday but i’m not sure if they can do anything either. my case says active but i’m afraid they’ll close it. 

it’s almost the end of the month and i don’t want to lose my benefits. any advice? thank you in advance.

"florida snaps student eligibility i've been using snaps since 2020 when i first moved out for college. starting july 1st, i stopped being eligible, or so i think? i reapplied for august and they told me i was not eligible for august and september. it now says ""techincal\_question technical\_verification"" and that the status is processing.

"questions about florida snap benefits, involving members of households... thank you for this resource, i've already learned some by going over posts.

so, when i was living in alabama, i applied only as myself as a household when i was living with my then roommate. i made my own money, paid my own side of bills, cooked my own food and subsequently got my own benefit.

here in florida they seem to say that everyone you live with is counted as members of your household, and they don't make distinctions like they did in alabama.

my mom and me (i'm 33) live together, pay our own bills, split rent, cook our food, etc. i'm wondering how i just have me on ebt, because she makes too much for both of us to apply (moreover, she doesn't need ebt, but i do).

if someone is applying for calfresh who is disabled and not able to work but not yet on anything like ssi or ssdi, how do they go about getting exemption from work requirement? i saw on one site you can get a letter from a doctor. would this letter be asked for after applying initially or is it part of the application process? can you apply online if you need to get a letter for exemption? do they have an outline of what the letter needs to say? this would be in riverside county"
"north carolina i am trying to register on the edge app. i’ve tried on the app and the website. after putting all my stuff in, the “register” button just stays grey. it’s unclickable.  i even tried just signing in using my ncid in case that would work. nothing. 
im worried a few months ago i got skimmed, and without being able to sign in to go back and look, i can’t prove it in case i need to be reimbursed ! 

any suggestions/ ideas?  i tried calling but they simply said “it’s a known issue, you’ll have to keep trying til it works there’s nothing we can do”

"snap work registration i got a letter in mail about me being registered for work. i’m in school and my situation is really complicated. i’m 19, but my mom applies for food stamps by using me. it’s not illegal as her name is technically saying she lives in our house. (she doesn’t) but legally, the government agrees this is her house somehow because she had covid and nearly died last year and had to live here for a while, so now it’s on a lot of her documents. i’ve lived with my grandma since i was 15 and she just got kicked out of here. she was back because she has no job no car no place to live and we almost pulled a eviction if she didn’t leave, but she did finally, so we weren’t able to do the eviction anyways. i don’t want snap, i don’t even get the benefits actually because she’s been a deadbeat and i don’t even talk to her anymore. if i just don’t do anything, will snap stop? will any legal issues go against me? can i just ignore it?"

"looking for information my mil is in low cost housing. i was wondering if she would qualify for food stamps? my husband is spending nearly $400 a month on food for her and it is cutting into our expenses. i would rather divided that money into our kids college fund account.

\-mil is in her 60s  
\-mil does not work  
\-she lives in low cost housing in maryland by herself (no other dependents)   
\-i think her disability check is 1100 a month (that is what she brings in monthly)

i do not have access to her information so i cannot call anyone. i feel like it is her responsibly but she is entitled and expects everyone to do things for her.

**i order groceries from amazon fresh regularly. i used my ebt in july without issue on fresh. i have used my ebt to buy nonperishable foods as well on prime with no issue.** 

**last night i tried to order on fresh and my ebt was declined. i've tried 5 times canceling and retrying since.** no, my cards are not frozen as nothing actually goes through and as a test i  ordered a few items from prime today using my ebt and it went fine. five hours and no issues and the debit is showing on my ebt card as well. knock on wood.... sigh.

*i have zero ebt ineligible items, i have no substitutions marked, i have a valid cc card on file for my tip and fees (although i keep reading that ebt buyers aren't supposed to be charged for delivery, i always am). my cart is 1/3 of my available ebt food balance as well. i tried taking my card off and putting it back on my account but that didn't help either.*

it's insane because prime items come from warehouses all over the country and fresh is local. if anything i would expect it to be the other way around with ebt ordering due to the out of state possibilities for prime items. **i can't get a hold of a human at ebt so i can't get help on their end. i have sent an email but it will be a week or so before/if anyone replies. since my orders aren't going through amazon cs won't help me because there is not a specific item to connect my inquiry to either. i am so frustrated. i had zero issues until last night using amazon fresh for groceries.**

**is anyone else having this specific issue?**  i am in california la county for reference. 

**does anyone else have any other ideas?** like i stated, i have no substitutions marked, there are no non food items and i have two alternate cards available for the fees. amazon shows me clearly that it is the ebt not my cards that are the issue. or **does anyone know how to get a real live human on the ebt cs phone line?** i have googled and found nothing useful that i haven't already tried.

"caseworker messed up my income during my sar. how to get calfresh amount readjusted? i was originally receiving $281 monthly ebt. i had to update all my info, including my newly reduced hours for my first job and the expected hours for my second job. well, my caseworker put my income in as working regular hours for my first job, making it look like i make a lot more money than i currently do. my calfresh was then reduced to $66 starting 07/01.

i sent them my updated paystubs a few weeks ago as well as explicitly stating they got it wrong. i have received acknowledgement of the documents through the benefits portal, but still not change in my benefit amount. i requested a phone appointment a week ago but have not been contacted. what else can i do to escalate this? i can’t afford only having $66 for food until december.

edit: would like to add that i have medi-cal and the income that the caseworker put for me would cause me to be ineligible. never got a notification from medi-cal though 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"applying as separate household for fs and other ""welfare"" if someone lives with family members but receives food stamps and/or other free government programs, how do they apply for ""separate"" household?

they used to give papers or you do it online and separate household was an option you could checkmark and/or write about. 

not everyone in my household shared or made the same amount of money as one another, etc so someone mentioned doing separate household as an option (social worker and/or aquaintance)

i have literally contacted dhs and told them this. and they couldn't give any fucks their system was being taken advantage of. none what so ever. 

this woman lets her mom and friends use or buy these food stamps. 

i continuously remind my friend to remind her that money is for their kids. 

she then says he can apply for all the same benefits. which isn't possible. and that she's a full-time parent so she gets full-time benefits, even though she only has those kids part time.

why is dhs so fucking useless?"
"needed a note from mil, but now they are sending a paper for a landlord? | indiana p-ebt question. i’m in indiana. we recently moved in with my mil, and have re-applied. my mil gets her own food stamps, so our case is separate.

no big deal. but i see on my benefits portal they are sending me a paper for a landlord to fill out. she did not mention this on the phone, and i have no clue when this paper is supposed to arrive and the deadline to turn our stuff in is in a few days. i have everything else waiting, just didn’t think we’d need anything else.

should i turn in what i have and just explain i didn’t know about that paper?

on the app i use to check my ebt balance, it states that p-ebt and summer p-ebt were approved for the state. my kiddo who is in school qualifies for it so i'm assuming we will get it, i still have both my kids p-ebt cards from 2021. but last november i received p-ebt (i believe it was the summer one) deposits on my normal ebt card. 

the website isn't very clear, or maybe i just am not understanding, will the benefits for that later this month be sent to their p-ebt cards or my ebt card like in november? 
i also have a baby and 5 year old who aren't in school that i don't have a p-ebt card for, and i received ""extra/p-ebt"" for back in november (on my normal card)."
"categorized as abawd despite having two kids. i recently had my renewal interview via phone and during that, the case worker raced through work requirements, which didn’t apply to me the previous (our first year) of snap. (i suppose due to either the pandemic or the circumstances that put me into the position of needing the help in the first place.)

after the interview i received a letter, stating that i am required to comply with work provisions and work requirements.

however, in the same letter it states that those with someone under the age of 18 in the snap household (both kids are under 12) are not required to comply with the requirements.

i am very confused by this and am not sure if a mistake was made.

also, as i tried to find answers i read something about all the requirements not being in effect until june 2023 anyway (i am in il).

my older child is special needs (doesn’t receive ssi) and i have to be home when he is because a regular “babysitter” would never be able to handle him. which means 80 hours a month would be very hard to manage.

"snap colorado | snap and medicaid | medical assistance | question | ebt | please help me | ebt colorado | help needed for colorado medicaid | colorado medicaid question hello.

i have a question regarding snap benefits. if a person, with a marital status single filer, lives with 1 more person, but they don't share food and each one is responsible for their food. is this other person who is not applying for snap benefits considered part of the household or not? even though these two people share the same house the second one is not used. so should the second person be included or not in the application?

thank you.

hello.

if my income from $346 increases to $544 a month, is my food stamps and medicaid gonna get canceled or not? in co state.

 it looks like the colorado medical assistance program can't verify my us citizenship automatically i don't why. i've been asked if i'm us born because of this. i have provided my ssn letter showing a us citizen's domestic born, and i have provided us life insurance showing my us place of birth. i asked if i can mail them my voter id and certificate showing that i'm a us citizen, obviously. they said unfortunately our system would not be able to use the voter id and the colorado online voter registration certificate as valid proof of u.s. citizenship. once you receive your birth certificate or a passport. i don't have both and i don't have money to order. so, ssn, life ins. or voter won't help. the lady used all resources over the phone she couldn't. what should i do? should email them my voter id?

colorado medicaid replied: we will just need the full ssn to clear that verification off your case.

what does mean this sentence?

if the ebt card never arrives, then you call to get a new one, are previously canceled? because they asked me do you want to cancel this one i said yes. so i'm worried if i should keep the same ebt number card that was 3 times returned or if the new card number is good.

desperately needing help.

co medicaid can't verify my citizenship, so they asked for my proof. i provided them with the ssa verification letter all matched, ssn us citizen domestic born. they say they can't accept that one and asking me for a passport now or a birth certificate plus an ssn card. i mean, please. is not the ssa letter enough? is anyone in the same situation in colorado?

jesus.

my ebt card was returned back twice to the county and they told me because my address doesn't have a drive so the card was back to the sender. what does it mean doesn't have a drive? my address is a dr. and i'm receiving all mail from the county so why not the ebt card? how comes? i'm confused. do they mail it through usps or does a regular person drops it off?

&#x200b;

i got a voicemail left from an administrative coordinator, what does that mean?

hello people.

i really need your advice.

i applied and got approved for medicaid in colorado, but they're asking me for proof of my us citizenship, such as a birth certificate,  passport, or other proof. i have already given them life insurance showing the us place of birth because this is under other third-level proof as well. they said they can't accept that one. secondly, i gave them an ssa verification letter that i am us born, a domestic-born citizen, and they said neither. i don't have a passport or birth certificate now, and i don't have money to order one from the vital check, and the deadline is coming. what i have is my  colorado online voter registration confirmation certificate that of course i'm a us citizen and i have my voter id with my id number. do you think they can accept this one at the moment? will i get in trouble or not give them all of these documents?

also, they are asking me to provide them with a letter that i did not receive benefits in another state. i did not so how the other state would give me a determination letter of not receiving benefits if i never applied for it?

thank you.

i've been approved for food and medical assistance and currently receiving benefits. i have been asked to submit proof of us citizenship, such as a passport, birth certificate, or other proof. i'm us born citizen, but don't have any of these besides my us life insurance showing the us place of birth, my voter id, and the voter certification form that say i'm a us citizen.

i have uploaded the life insurance but they said that can't accept that one. but clearly says us life insurance is considered also as other proof of citizenship.

what should i do? i don't want my medical assistance medicaid to be canceled in april. i'm in colorado."
"new york focus story on snap delays in new york | new york focus reporter looking to speak to snap recipients and experts hi r/foodstamps \-- the mods here were kind enough to let me post here a few months ago letting people know i was working on an article for new york focus about snap application delays. a number of you were generous enough to reach out, and this subreddit ultimately had a pretty significant influence on the story we published this morning. here it is: [https://nysfocus.com/2023/05/15/need-food-stamps-in-new-york-come-back-in-a-few-months](https://nysfocus.com/2023/05/15/need-food-stamps-in-new-york-come-back-in-a-few-months)

thanks to those of you who were willing to speak with me! focus will run a few more stories on this topic over the next few months, so if you've had problems with snap (or other public benefits) in new york, please do reach out. we're especially interested in hearing from dss workers who handle public benefits applications, and our next story will likely focus on staffing issues. and, of course, always want to hear feedback on our coverage, so let me know what you think!

you can reach me at alex@nysfocus.com.

hi r/foodstamps, i'm alex lubben, a reporter with new york focus ([nysfocus.com](https://nysfocus.com)).

i'm working on a story about delays in processing snap applications in non-nyc counties in new york state. through a records request, we got data from the state that indicates that illegal delays in processing snap applications are widespread.

if you've applied for snap in new york state and it took longer than 30 days to get an approval (or denial), i'd love to talk to you. or, if you're a case worker at a dss office in new york state, i'd also love to talk to you. it's our understanding these offices are understaffed, and that working in dss has become harder over the course of the pandemic.

if you do reach out to me: i am more than happy to speak off the record or to quote you anonymously if you prefer. i'll consider any initial conversation from people on this subreddit off the record until we agree otherwise.

you can reach me by phone / whatsapp / signal at (914) 275-5607. my email address is [alex@nysfocus.com](mailto:alex@nysfocus.com)."

no pending benefits in nyc so everything is fine with my case i been recertified in june or july online and over the phone so i know my case is fine and active. it says my cash is available tonight at 12 but nothing about the snap benefits. anyone else having this issue?
"i’m being investigated for food stamp fraud. i got a call on friday from an investigator saying they think my recertification is fraudulent because i and our children live with my ex but didn’t report his income. i was unaware that i had to report his income because i thought we were considered separate households.

i have been on medicaid since 2016 when i had to leave my job because o hyperemesis from pregnancy with our first child. i was in a car accident near the end of my pregnancy which injured my back so badly i’ve been unable to go back to work. he’s always been resentful of this (and me keeping our baby in the first place) and insists that i pay as much as i can of the bills because “he’s not my benefactor”. 

i ran up debt on my only credit card and had to borrow money from my parents to pay bills after leaving my job in june 2016. in the spring of 2019 i finally received my settlement check which i reported to medicaid. we bought a house (also reported). i started going back to school that fall but got pregnant and again had severe morning sickness to the point i had to leave school. we broke up shortly after i found out i was pregnant but decided to stay living together because of our daughter. i was able to pay off my credit card and stretch my money until about april of 2020. he helped me for a bit until june of 2020 when he lost his job due to the pandemic. he suggested i go on food stamps because he could not help me anymore without income. 

i applied for food stamps and was approved.
he had put our mortgage on forbearance. all of this was disclosed during my interview to get approved for food stamps. now we were more strict than ever about separation of expenses because we had to buy our groceries separate. i paid for my food and for my children’s food and stored it separately as well. he was unemployed for 6 months and paid his share with his unemployment checks. i got by with food stamps and the stimulus checks sent to everyone. he finally got a contract position at the end of january 2021 and started working from home. we continued to split expenses. the roommate situation was working fine for us for awhile. 

then i find out i’m pregnant from having slept with him one freaking time at the end of november 2020. i decide to keep baby. i had been self studying at home for a web dev job and felt confident i could get a job which would allow me to be flexible with my schedule and support my children fully. 

during this time time my food stamps are extended twice without them asking for any recertification or interview. i am able to pay my part of the bills from being extremely frugal and getting part of the child tax credit which started in june of 2021. i gave birth to our youngest in august of 2022. continued to pay for kids expenses and part of the utilities with child care tax credit and my credit card. this whole time mortgage was on forbearance. 

finally, the county sends me notice that it’s time to reapply for my food stamps. i send in my recertification at the beginning of december 2021. ex gets word that the contract position he’s been working is ready to offer him full time employment but that he’ll have to come into the office 2x /week as an actual employee. i tell him if he does that we’ll have to work out a way to keep me and the kids safe from catching covid (kids can’t be vaccinated and i’m high risk). i suggest he wear a mask when around us. didn’t think it would be a big deal since he spent most of his time in the basement (his bed and office were downstairs). he refuses and states he’d rather move out and live in his motor home. he starts cleaning his stuff out and sleeping in his motor home most of the time which is parked in front of the house. in the meantime, my food stamps have yet to be approved due to backlog.

i finally got a call for an interview at the beginning of last week. then this past friday i get another call from an investigator saying i should have reported my ex’s income. she accused me of still being in a relationship with him saying we looked real happy on facebook (which is weird cause we have no recent pics together on fb and my profile pic is of me with my baby).  i told her how he had just moved  out and explained we were not a couple.

i am very confused about the whole situation and why the county would think i am trying to lie when i’ve been very forthright this whole time. it was my understanding that we were separate households due to splitting costs of expenses and no longer being a couple. my ex has always insisted that he’s not liable for my expenses and that since i chose to have kids i needed to support them as best as possible.

any advice for a situation like this?"

"random people using my address to apply i moved in to my current atp early 2019. i applied to calfresh on and off (off when they messed up my renewal) for a little over a year now. 

suddently months back, i got mail from 2-3 random people using my exact address with apt on it for medicare/cal and calfresh. i tried to write ""return to sender"" many times and kept getting them. after a while, i just placed them on top of my apt complex mailbox and they were all picked up each time. i can't seem to find a way to fix this. 

 i am just a bit worry if this will affect me or my case or not. i know my apt complex is pretty messed up. there are families with 5-6 people and 2 dogs renting just one br. so i am not sure if calfresh investigate this or not."
"can snap be cut off without warning? hi there, me again. normally around this time of month, my benefits will show as ""pending"" in my ebt edge account, but this month nothing is pending and i'm really worried.

i have an open disability case, and if you're at all familiar with that system you'd know it can take *years* before you're approved for disability. i'm unable to work, and i've been relying on food stamps to keep myself from starving. and now, i'm very worried they're going to cut me off. i've been keeping an eye on my mail but nothing has shown up, is it possible that i could be cut off from food stamps without any warnings?"

"my family lost snap because fssa didn't update our new address in their system (indiana) my family moved 11-28-22 and i reported the change to the office on 12-7-22.  i got all the information turned in on time and everything was fine for a while.  we continued receiving benefits from december through april.  however, the woman i spoke to in december told me they'd mail an interim contact form that would be due in april and if i didn't fill it out and return it on time i'd lose my benefits.  on april 27th i remembered that conversation and realized that i hadn't seen the form in the mail, so i signed into my fssa benefits portal online and saw that they'd mailed it in march and it was already past due and my benefits would end april 30th.

i called the office and the woman i spoke to asked me to confirm my dob, address, and phone number.  it turns out that they hadn't updated my address in december and they'd sent the form to my former address.  she put me on hold while she spoke to her supervisor then told me that they had just updated my address and told me to go to the office to fill out the form.  i asked if it would be ok considering that it was already past due and she said yes, it was their mistake.  i asked if i would need to appeal their decision to cancel my benefits to ensure that i would keep my benefits while it gets sorted out.  she said no, it would get fixed.  i filled the form out the next day (april 28th) and thought everything would be ok.

our benefits are deposited the 11th of every month.  on may 9th i checked online and nothing had changed.  it still said my snap ended april 30th.  i called the office again and the woman i spoke to said they'd just ""sent it up yesterday.""  she said it shouldn't take too long to get fixed.  it is at the state level now.  i asked if i should just apply again, maybe for expedited food stamps. (i have  no income right now.)  she said no, it would be ok.  a ""higher up"" just has to approve it.  it should be soon, she said.

i called again the 15th (monday) and spoke to the same woman.  i was told the same things.  

it's now the 17th.  our food stamps are 6 days late.  my teenage kids are telling me to apply for emergency food stamps so we can get them sooner.  i'm really starting to panic.  we're relying on food from my dad because we have no food stamps and he really can't afford to help us.  i'm worried that this isn't going to get fixed and i'll just be sitting here waiting for no reason.  if someone higher up decided not to fix this, i wouldn't know.  there's no pending application to deny.  i'm compulsively checking online to see if anything has changed.  is there any way to speak to someone ""higher up?"" if it's at state level, as opposed to county, is their a number to call?  is there anything at all i can do?"
"inflation & possible ebt adjustments? | they won’t respond hi,
did a little research & saw that we are getting so little this year because the fiscal year cost-of-living adjustment is based off of 2021 or 2022… if this is true; when can we expect to see an updated fiscal year cost-of-living adjustment that will account for inflation 2023?

if this makes no sense im sorry 😭 might have my info twisted😩

hi everyone,

i had to reapply for food stamps with my sister due to my mother stealing food stamps. when we submitted she said she wanted us to have our own cards so she would take the application for my sister, but i would need to submit my own; which i did!

it has been 30+ days since i’ve submitted the application. i have called and have only ever been able to talk to the receptionist briefly before she transfers me to my new caseworker. when trying to connect with caseworker he never picks up and i am left to leave a voicemail. they say they are short staffed but they are still supposed to send things out on time!

i have not received any letters/confirmation from them and the only reason i know who my new caseworker is; is because of the receptionist lady.

basically i am wondering who i should contact a bit higher up because they are not meeting the 30 day period that is promised."

"nyc: ""new system removed rent on file for many."" | nyc office rent mistake this is an update to an earlier post. recap: i didn't receive my snap benefits this month and the agent asked me to submit a change report because the rent amount mysteriously disappeared from my case.

today i returned to get clarification on why this happened. she said that they have a new system that removed many people's rent on file. however, she looked highly suspicious, and when i said, ""so you must be getting a lot of people here with this problem,"" she couldn't look me in the eye when she said, ""yes."" mind you, an agent for cash assistance told me i was in luck because there were few people there for snap today. she had trouble responding directly to any of my questions and would only repeat, ""you have to wait. it will take about a month."" for example, when i asked if there was anything we could do so that i'm not penalized for the system's error:  ""no. you have to wait."" are my recertification documents still on file? ""yes."" why couldn't the recertification documents be used so i wouldn't have to submit the same rent bill with a change report? ""m'am, you have to wait."" does anyone have any tips on what i could have done differently? i'm at a loss.

this month i did not receive benefits. the office indicated that they had $0 for rent on file, even though i've been receiving benefits since before covid with a specified rent amount and renew every year. i was then asked to submit a change form with my rent receipt and told it would take a month for this to process. if the error was on their end, shouldn't i be reimbursed for this month? she said i wouldn't. i suspect she was uninformed, that the change form was the wrong strategy since my account already has the rent document. i shouldn't have needed to resubmit what was already physically on file even if not digitally in the system. or is there no protocol for this type of error so that i have to submit a change form regardless?"

where can i use my ebt card? i’ve had ebt for a while and i travel between two counties. i’ve been buying food from a different county than the one i reside in and a cal fresh representative called to tell me that i can only try to use it in the county that i live in. was this wrong of her to say? i thought i can use cal fresh anywhere.

"how far behind is texas? our snap was cut off after i was told i did not send in some documents they said they needed, even though our renewal isn't until the end of may. i did send in the documents they had requested and i waited on hold for nearly 2 hours to talk to someone who then verified yes, i did send all forms, and i sent them on time, so they didn't understand why they were terminating. that was on 3/17 and we were told since our benefits hit on the 23rd (they were being cut off on april 1st so we did get snap for march) they should have fixed it by the time the april date rolled around.  however, that change report from 3/17 hasn't even been viewed by anyone yet. 

as the subject lines asks, how far behind is texas?  we have been waiting 40 days now."
"applying for food stamps question so i am 21 years old, i live in florida at my grandma's house with her, my dad and my aunt and daughter. i was wondering if i could apply for food stamps so that i could get my own food since i don't eat what they usually eat and the few foods i eat my aunt and her daughter eat them. i was wondering if i could apply for just me but i only pay for half the utilities and no rent since i don't make enough money to contribute to rent. my aunt has food stamps but i don't know if her having food stamps to this address will affect me in any way. could i still do it??"
"pa snap decrease; worth an appeal? i am based in pa, am a graduate student, and therefore, my income is exempt and declared as 0. however, i am in a two-person household and my partner made $1,900 when we first applied six months ago. therefore, we received $286 for monthly snap benefits. my partner had to get a second job and now makes $2,400 a month and when we reported this on our semi-annual reporting, it decreased to $164 a month.  i am confused about the decrease since the income limit is $3,052 per month for a two-person household in pa. my partner and i are not married. when i called my case manager, she was extremely rude and impatient. she said i had declared him as someone who helps with food purchases and preparation, so that is why it decreased since he ""makes more"". $2,400 is still nothing for two people and a $120 decrease in help is quite a punch.

should i try to appeal, is it worth a shot?"

"what does application complete mean? | phone interview mistake called to check the status of a snap application and the machine told me “application was received and has been completed”. does this mean they received all the paper verifications and all i have to do is wait for the decision? 

i’m asking because i got a letter today from the snap office that was sent to me on 2/8/23 telling me to turn in a school verification form. i turned it in on that day but in the afternoon. i’m unsure if the letter was sent in the morning before i went to the office to hand them in. just wondering if i’m all good.

my mom applied for food stamps last week and was phoned in for an interview today. she was asked if i went to college/are a student and she said yes; the problem is that she mistook my online certification classes that i've been taking for community college/university classes and was vehemently asked to bring a financial award letter asap or else the case would be cancelled. obviously the problem here is that i do not have a financial award letter because i'm not attending any college－ just an online career school. i'm not sure on what to say or bring now. we really need the money right now and i'm afraid this slight error will get her whole case thrown away."
"$205 down to $23 i live in the state of illinois. april i did my yearly certification for snap. i got it raised to $205. april ,may, june , july i got $205. this month i get a letter saying it's being reduced to $23 because of increase of income. i am on disability i get $914 a month and that is all. in the paperwork they showed me it's saying that i'm getting an additional $599 of earned income from somewhere. i don't have any other income coming from anywhere besides the disability. i'm going to call them tomorrow to see what the deal is. i'm hoping it's just a data entry error. has anybody had this problem? i would appreciate any advice or insight.

edit: i just checked my social security account and there is nothing on there about any current or past employment in the past like 10 years. all it has is my current benefits from ssi. i thought i would check just in case somebody use my social security number. i don't know.

update: i called this morning and they said there were two pay stubs turned in and that's why they reduced the snap. i told them it was not me that i am on ssi and can't work. put me on hold for a few. when they came back they said that they fixed the problem. apparently there is somebody with the same 1st and last name as me. so it's all fixed now and they said they'll be sending me a letter in the mail.
i'm not sure how that even works with the pay stubs. you would think that they would check more identifiers then just first and last name."

"snap and tanf reallocation i am trying to figure out how budget management works at social services offices in most states.

from what i understand, the state allocates a certain amount for snap + tanf, and the counties in each state then take what they receive and earmark a certain amount for operating expenses and then the rest to the benefits. however, when the quarter ends with less applicants than were expected, i've read they can choose to carry over the funds to the next quarter, to use in case of a surge in applications, or they can also choose to just reallocate the funds at their discretion, or even return it to the state government.

the last two things are what i'm mostly curious about. any public finance people know what happens to the money usually in these cases? i figure it going directly into payroll again would probably be restricted.  


also, side question that i'm not as curious about, in case you're feeling generous! if the state governments get their snap/tanf allocations from federal funding, isn't that kind of weird? it sort of ties what's going on in 49 other state economies to your own likely very different state's economy, forcing you to change the amount of tax dollars from your own state that you're allocating for public assistance? or am i misunderstanding this?

"tx snap change report and tanf app at the end of march i went on disability from work due to health issues. 
i have already been receiving snap benefits and have been grateful for what i get to help with myself and two kids - so at first i didn’t plan to ask for more. especially since at the time i thought i’d be out maybe a week. well a week has turned into almost two months now and looking like it’s going to keep going as i try to get answers.
i ended up filling out the change report on april 27th showing my wage loss - which is almost a 2k loss a month because std benefits are terrible.
i also filled out the tanf cash help (on april 18th) just to see if i could get anything.
neither application or change have been looked at - and i have read some posts that say texas is very far behind - but at this point i’m down to nothing on my card - i have visited food banks and received what i could but my options are limited to what’s around me and what i know i can cook/my kids will eat.
so my question is - is it worth calling the food stamps number to check on my application and change or just keep waiting knowing i’ll hopefully get back pay for whatever decision they make?
i don’t want to sit on the phone for hours if it won’t help; but if i can do anything i will. 

i want to add to all the employees here - i appreciate you taking the time to respond to these posts and sharing information."

is it normal for them to send out this letter so late after my calfresh has been discontinued? what steps do i need to take to get my benefits back? do i need to mail in a new sar 7 or should i just wait for them to send in a new sar 7 for me to return to them? am i on a ticking clock before my case is closed entirely?

"proof of income & food stamps i am a 19 year old girl who was kicked out of my family home. i was taken in by my friends/now boyfriend at the beginning of this year after it all happened. when i first came here, i ended up being without a job for a couple months because i now live a distance from where i used to stay and don’t yet have a car. during that time i applied for food stamps, got it expedited, then by the time it came around for the interview i had just started working at applebees as a server. i wasn’t making much money which did reflect on my pay stubs so they continued to give me snap benefits of almost $140. i have since left that job and started serving somewhere else where my base pay is still $7.98 but make a bit more in tips. my question is, i plan on signing the new lease in november with my roommates (4 of us split the rent), so by then i need to prove that i make 3x the rent. if i am able to pick up shifts (work more than i’m scheduled if people don’t want their scheduled shifts) i believe i could make that, but would that have any affect on my food stamp eligibility if for a month or two my income is higher than originally reported, even though it won’t be a consistent thing following?"

my question is, would going to the dcf via scheduled appointment in-person to conduct a recertification interview be my best bet in preventing an interruption of my snap?

i'm finally feeling a little more comfortable with snap but now they want me to work medicaid cases. i've never been trained in medicaid and when i told them they kind of scoffed it off. 

is this normal? i asked them why don't they just train me in medicaid first but they say the agency is so behind they don't have time to train and i probably wont get medicaid trained until october. the problem is i notice a lot of cases are being done wrong by new people. and it seems like the whole not training people is making things worse. is this how it's always been?"
"got a job at the beginning of the month, reported it, but i'm still expected to get the full amount tomorrow, will i need to pay anything back? i found out i'd be training for a job on friday, july 29. i called that monday after my first day of training to let the office know i needed to make a change. they asked me about insurance, and because i didn't know the info yet, since it was my first day, i asked if i'd be able to call back. she said yes, and that was the end of the call. i wasn't able to submit changes until the 8th. i noticed on my account i was pre authorized for the full amount on the 17th of last month. will i need to pay anything back?
just for info on the job, i'm working full time, so i get 40 hours a week. i only get paid twice a month, at the beginning and towards the end. because i started at the beginning of the month, i shouldn't get paid until towards the end of the month. i'm just worried they'll fine me or something. :(

hello i am in los angeles county and i had a sar-7 report that was due by sept. 5,2022 for the month of august 2022 which i submitted online on 9/2/22 i received a letter from them on 10/18/2022 saying that my sar-7 report was received incomplete giving me until the end of october to send them what they needed or else risking my benefits being stopped now mind you the information that they are requesting that they say is missing i did submit that information along with my sar-7 report on the required date and did that online and i have the confirmation number as proof but i went ahead and complied with the request of what they needed to complete my incomplete sar-7 report and i resent that information to them online again getting a confirmation number as proof and that did this on 10/19/2022 one day after i received in the mail the incomplete sar-7 report letter but come november 3,2022 my benefits were not loaded to my ebt card so i called them on 11/04/2022 and asked them to transfer me to the department that handles the reprocessing of sar-7 reports which they did and the ew whom i spoke looked up my case and she confirmed that i had filled out and sent in my documents in a timely fashion and it was an error on their end and not an error on my part so she reprocessed my report while i stayed on the line with her which took about 30min she then told me she was going to expedite my case to her supervisor for final sign off and i should receive my benefits within a 3-5 day window we are now almost in dec and i still have not received my benefits i’ve called several times this month and i keep getting the same answer from the ew that i see you have called several times and what i’ve done for you is i have put a note on your case to my supervisor saying urgent that even though you filled out your report in a timely fashion your benefits were stopped when they should not have and then i ask when i will see my benefits reinstated they can’t say but that it has been transferred to a supervisor for approval and that my benefits will be retroactive but this is what they have been saying every time i’ve called this month today i called and again they said it’s waiting for a supervisor approval i asked to speak or be transferred to a supervisor but was told they could not do that and that i just needed to wait is there anything else i can do that i’m not doing aside from filing an appeal which when i asked the ew about that she said that if i file to have a hearing on my case that it would delay my benefits even longer from being reinstated is there anything else i can do i would greatly appreciate any help with matter thank you.

hello i hope someone can help me i was included in a class action lawsuit and just received a check for 12,000 dollars will i need to report this as income to calfresh and also how does this affect me going forward because i do not have any income that i report normally because i do not work the only income i report is money that my parents send me monthly which is 300 to buy things that i can’t buy with my ebt card so this 12.000 check is a check that is a onetime only monitory payment not something that i will get monthly so how does this affect my eligibility i know i need to fill out the sar report of change document but will they disqualify me because i will be reporting a change of income for the month of august as 12,300 instead of my normal 300 and also will i need to fill out the sar report twice one for this month for the check that i just received and then next month when my income goes back to 300 a month because of not getting another check for 12,000 i hope someone can clarify this for me thanks so much"
"what happens next after an investigator comes to your home? ca an investigator came to my home unannounced after i submitted my mid year report. she told me that because i received help from my children’s father and he spent time with the kids here in the home it would be as if he lived here in the eyes of the county, she said “he lives here” she told me i could add him or sign a form to end benefits so i signed to end benefit because she said that could be considered fraud and could cause problems for
him by sending people to
his job. i haven’t heard back, i log on a the case is still active. i am very worried i don’t know what to do. should i call my worker? after she left i had to explain the situation to my child’s father and we decided to just have him move back in since he can afford to continue to fully support us and himself in his own living place. this all was suppose to be temporary since i lost my income last year sep. i did log on after and report him in the home. my question is what happens after the investigator come?

"food vs cash assistance hello,

i live in florida. i was recently approved for food assistance, but not for cash assistance (is there a separate application?). is there any way i can get the cash instead of groceries if i don’t have this assistance? i had some retroactive payments and my balance is higher than what i’ll use anytime soon. i was hoping to take cash out for the things food assistance doesn’t pay for. any advice for a work-around? 

thanks!"

"abawd letter? | recertification issues (ky) i received a letter today telling me of the changes to the abawd requirements. i'm trying to figure out if this letter is just sent out to everyone, or if i'm somehow marked as abawd in the system and that's why i've gotten it.

to me (and my sister) it seems bit ambiguous and we're not sure if it's actually a notice or just a 'hey this is a change that's happeming'.

i'm disabled (blind) and receive ssi. since i've become disabled 8ish years ago i never was required to take place in the work program/hold x amount of hours at a job. has this changed?

i'm also willing to call if needed but would rather not if this was just a mass mailed letter to snap recipients in ky.

(sorry if this is all jumbled i'm happy to clarify my thoughts questions as needed)

(kentucky)  so i was supposed to recertify in june, which is fine i did the phone call, all was good.

then close to the end of the month, i got an automated phone call 'reminding' me to turn in paperwork. paperwork that the worker i talked to didnt inform me about. i call back. im told i have to return some sort of proof that what i said was right and it was due the 30th. fine. i figured out what was needed, and had someone write it out for me and mail it off.

keep in mind the only thing i've recieved so far was the need to recertify.  a week ago i get the form that was supposed to be sent out to me. dated the 28th. but i already sent in the information the worker asked for, so i ignored it.

yesterday i got a letter saying they didn't receive my information. i call today the first worker who i talked to said they saw a document on  file (wouldn't even say what the document was) but she was sending me to a case worker. fine i expected that. i'm on hold for 2+ hours and when they picked up they immediately disconnected the call.

i dont know what to do? i'm not in a position to go to an office (i'm disabled(blind) and rely on family/friends to take me places). and i know i should have called to make sure they recieved my info, but i have a lot going on at the moment and it slipped my mind.

is my only option to call every morning until i finally talk to someone and get it figured out? i cant afford even one month with stamps. 

i understand they're over worked and understaffed, but i've never had this much difficulty in my 8 yrs of receiving benefits. 

to note: - kynect (our local website) wont let me log in, i've literally never been able to get it to work.
-i would utilize food pantries but the ones near me are only open a couple hours on certain days and i dont have a way to get there.
-im calling them again first thing in the morning.

i came here because i've i've alot of times theres advice given that i wouldn't have thought of hopefully someone can do the same for me.

tl;dr i dont think my recertification went through and i'm not sure what to do next."
"student denied in ga so me and my partner applied for food stamps in georgia. my partner was approved but i was denied because i don’t work more than 20 hours a week as a student.  but i was under the impression that because i both qualify for a work study and have an efc of zero, that i was eligible for food stamps. do i need to call my case worker? 

i think it’s insane to ask me to work 20 hours a week. i have 18 hour semesters and i work every weekday, my shifts are only 4 hours though so i can have time for homework and idk maybe sleep and eat?? this is so fucked up"
"do i currently qualify for food stamps as a college student? if not, what’s my best approach to get on them? (ma) i’m currently a freshman living in the dorms on a meal plan during the school semester and do not have a work study or a job. i am homeless and my school does not offer food during the month-long winter break or during the summer, and i am currently trying to apply in order to feed myself for those times. i am estranged from my family and receive no support from them. i have a suspicion my current application is going to be denied on account of me receiving 2/3 of my meals during semester times from the school but i have no way of feeding myself outside of that and am only asking for what i need when the plan no longer covers food for me.

do you think they will currently accept my application or can they accept it on a limited basis enough to give me food for the times the school does not? if not, what’s my best approach to ensure it’ll be accepted when i get kicked off my meal plan in the spring and can apply again?"
"benefits repeatedly stolen, county no help in kern county ca hey everyone 
i am making this post on behalf of my friend. we live in bakersfield ca. starting in july of 2022 she has had her cash aid stolen off her card 4 times and had over $1000 in food stamps taken off her card in december. her worker won’t return her phone calls. the people at the front desk won’t transfer her to a supervisor. she’s filled out the paperwork, she’s made a police report. she’s done everything on her side she has needed to do but the county is basically stonewalling her.

"tx. is emergency snap still a thing? long story short, my husband lost his job 2 weeks ago. we spent everything moving to be closer to his job, then fired a week later (unemployment isnt possible). we are -$450. barely have any food but doing what we can to make it last. hes been looking, putting in over 60 applications but it's going to be weeks until money might start coming in. so, is emergency snap still a thing? even getting it for one month would amazing."
"no benefits and no pending payment? recently, we relocated to nyc because of unfortunate circumstances. someone told me to apply for emergency everything (snap, ebt cash, medicaid). of course, i did. so, we applied on the 6th and supposedly got approved for emergency funds. we received them on the 11th after going up there and getting a supervisor approval (partial amount). then, we sent all these documents through the app and i received a letter in the mail saying we were approved until 06/30/2023. thank goodness!! after approval, we received the rest of the emergency funds on january 28th.

so, i googled when benefits come and because of the ending of my card is should be in today. i checked at midnight and nothing. i checked again and still nothing. i even went on the website to see any pending payments: nothing. i'm starting to freak because we literally have no income (partner just got a job after being a month here, but starts on the 9th) and we do not have diapers for my little one. will the funds arrive or is everyone else experiencing delays? is this common? does it normally come at a later time?

i apologize if i am giving off any vibes. i am extremely unhinged. thank you for any advice or details you provide. i will be calling hra to see any information they can provide. again, thank you to anyone with information."

"unconventional living situation affect eligibility? i live in western ny. i recently got a letter from nys of health stating my husband and i now qualify for medicaid with our 16 month old son. so i thought i would look back into food stamps, especially with how insanely expensive food is right now.

so i live in the country, my mother in law owns the house. there is an apartment that used to be a garage that is on the back of the house. that's where me, my husband and son live. there is no way to enter the main house from the apartment without going outside and through the front door so it's completely separate other than we are on the same electric and other utilities. 

my mother in law and brother in law live in the main house. my husband works full time while i'm a sahm. 
his mom and brother also both work at the same local grocery store.
we pass his mom about 550$ a month that's basically meant for our share of utilities and whatever else. 

with trying to help pay for upkeep on the house as a whole, vehicles breaking down amongst everything else, we are scraping by. my father in law passed away from cancer almost a year ago and my mother in law can't get his ss or whatever  it is until she turns 60 at the very end of 2024.

not sure how the living situation will affect our eligibility, i don't want to get in trouble for fraud, if i can't get it, it will be what it will be but i don't want to start the process then potentially get in trouble because of the living situation. 

not sure if i'm forgetting any context but any help would be appreciated."

"food stamps and casual reselling of property / online sales income after our unemployment runs out, we may find the need to apply for food stamps, and i was wondering how ""income"" from online sales would count or need to be disclosed.  if i sell something online (ebay) and they deposit an amount from the sale lets say $100. and it goes into my bank account as $100, will the food stamps people care?  will they want to count the whole amount of $100?  or will they understand that $50 was cost of goods, $10 was shipping and $10 was costs of fees or business expenses, meaning the income was only $30.  i'm just wondering what to expect, and if i should suspend my variable online selling in favor of something certain.  any advise is appreciated.  i don't know the right way to handle this.  another question would concern sale of personal property in which there was no profit.  like if i sold my wedding ring at a loss.  would food stamps count this as income?   thank you.  nc is the state."

(my system still says i have an interview at 9 but i already handled that interview earlier this week, either way i know they're probably goanna call anyways. i was prepared to tell them i hadn't received any forms. please advise me on what to do and if i should still take that call or not?

i just applied and checked the boxes under qualified emergency for quicker service, i'll run out of food in 3 days or less, it said they will call me or i can call, which do you recommend? 

also, the last time i applied to get my medical coverage off my moms case and onto my own (application for own insurance i mean) i was told they're unlikely to do that as its easier to keep it on her case and that way i wouldn't have to use a different address, does anyone know if those policies have changed? 

either way it won't matter to me because it's better for me both ways but i also realize it is actually better if my medical case stays under my mom, both for the keeping of the address benefit and also so i wouldn't have to do the medical application all over, i have a good feeling this would be the case, but since i did tell them i was under abusive circumstances (over 18 her, 25 to be exact) i wonder if they used this info in their decision to possibly take me off everything, which again can only be a benefit for me since it'd be better to have everything under my  case for the future, i am about to call right now and find out anyways.

 the only underlying factor i would mention about wanting the case to be completely under me would be so i don't have any hardship in the future if my mother tries to claim i'm mentally ill and cannot be taken off unless her authorization allows it (i doubt they would approve that without proof from me ) and i wouldn't doubt my mother from taking those steps in the future even if she hasn't so far, she is the type to threaten herself with injury so the cops will believe her over me or anyone else in the household anyway, she's done it before so i'd rather not let history repeat itself in that regard with something she could control like that, i don't have my own place currently that's why i'm applying for assistance to get the ball rolling and because i really need food right now.

hi, my sar7 came in the mail but i received it on the 6th. the letter stated i should have turned it in between august 1st and the 5th. obviously it was late and i still submitted it anyways. good thing to, cause when i uploaded it online i saw the notice that we have til next month to submit the form even if it's late. 

however, knowing that it's been submitted late, even a day later than it needed to be, i am curious how long it will take to process my sar7 so i can continue getting my stamps? 

i believe i read something about how there may be a delay in benefits by like 10 days from the day i usually receive them if this is the case, being as a sar 7 is submitted late.

i haven't seen any updates by mail or online notices. not even my ebt app is showing me when i will get the next allotment of benefits.

i understand this is probably because i submitted late and therefore priority isn't being given to me (cases like mine because i missed the due date) so i'm curious when i can expect it to be processed or get an update?

additionally, does this mean i will still get full benefit amount or half?

so in essence. 2 questions.

1. how long to expect my sar7 to get approved since it was submitted 1 day after the allotted time slot (which is okay because the online notice informa me of submission extension until 9/30/23 ) 

2. will i still get my full beneft amount?

i am in los angeles county, ca.

please let me know if you have any follow up questions.

does anyone know if the verification letter stating that we are of low income they area in california?

i signed up for gr and got the electronic verification and authorization forms last week, one of them is called authorization for reimbursement of interim assistance initial claim or post eligibility case and the box next to ssi/ssa is checked. i'm not under ssi or is this form saying i authorize the state to reimburse the program for helping me out with money? cause that's what it sounds like when i reread it ore again, just want to make sure i know what it's for before i send it in? any food stamps or gr workers can answer or anyone else? please and thank you."

"ga- would they reload my old ebt card with new benefits?? i don't think my title explains my situation well so i will clarify

my family had foodstamps for quite a while last year but were told that we made too much money to qualify and  therefore stopped receiving benefits. i threw away my card. this was, if i remember correctly, october 2020. 

after some new jobs and income changes, i reapplied last month and finally, after getting our proofs together, we got approved about a week ago. yay!! 

i automatically assumed that i would be getting a new card in the mail but during a conversation with my friend she mentioned that its a shame that i threw my card away because they would have just reloaded it. 

it never even crossed my mind that i never reported disposing of my card to anyone, so now i'm worried that my long-gone card has almost $1000 on it sitting in a landfill somewhere. is this a thing?? or is it the norm to be sent a new card that is attached to the new case number?

any and all help is appreciated!"

"how does calfresh eligibility work? hi, i've been trying to find information about eligibility for calfresh. my best friend doesn't make a lot of money, and her rent is almost her entire paycheck. 

she doesn't think she can get food stamps because she makes about $2400 a month right now, which is above all of different amounts that we can find online for a 1 person household. 

but my big question is if her rent is $2100, would they be looking at the $2400, or the leftover $300? 

obviously $300 would make her eligible, but probably not the $2400? 

i tried to get her to apply anyway just to see what happens, but she ""doesn't want to go through the whole process for nothing."" hoping i can get some info that will convince her to apply, because she's struggling big time, and i hate seeing her like this. 

we're in california, alameda county. 

thanks!"
"first month of food stamps (not receiving benefits) | saving my benefits i received my food stamps earlier this month for the first time on the 3rd which included ""initial amount"" and ""prior months benefits"". my date to receive benefits monthly is the 22nd but i did not receive any. i was planning to call them tomorrow but also wasn't sure if i just don't receive them this month since i received them earlier in the month or if there was an issue. i still have plenty on my card so that's no issue but i would just like to know if i need to contact them.

i have kinda been budgeting and trying to save my benefits as much as i can for when i start back to college in a few weeks. i currently have about $500 in my account. would this cause them to not add my monthly benefits?"
"issues with cal fresh recertification form i used the benefitscal portal website to submit my (sar7) recertification form, but i’m not sure if it was processed or not. three days ago when i logged in it said not reviewed so i tried logging in again today & it says nothing.the form i submitted was completely gone with no status or update…. has anyone else experienced this ? could this mean that the recertification form was processed or denied…? i am still learning things when it comes to certain government assistance/benefits so at times this can become quite stressful & confusing… just want to be prepared,and not have any surprises especially with easter dinner and my daughter’s birthday party coming up."

"is allowing family members live rent-free with you affect the amount of snap benefits? | snap benefits reduced by more than half | ca snap benefits/medi-cal & lump sum benefits with rollover survivor ira my aunt (64) and uncle (65) both are retired, and are receiving monthly ssa retirement benefits of $1016 (uncle) +$487 (aunt). their daughter and 2 small children live with them and she helps her parents out by buying food and sharing it together. she doesn't pay rent nor utilities as it is tough already paying for her and her children's expenses. 

my aunt and uncle would like to know if they can still apply for snap benefits here in the state of california, but would like to know beforehand if having their daughter along with her children live with them rent-free is going to pose a problem of getting approved for snap.

thanks in advance for any and all input.

ever since my husband passed away and i lost my job (2 months after his passing) last year, i decided to apply for california snap benefits and medi-cal. i have never applied for any of these program before and therefore don't know how they work.  i was granted both. my snap monthly benefit amount was $740 and it had remained the same until i had to recertification last week- it dropped significantly to $256 for a 3 person household. nothing has changed except that i started receiving monthly death benefits from my late husband's pension plan in the amount of $1170, plus a monthly $942 from ssa for survivor benefits. obviously, they take into account what i pay for mortgage and utilities. 2 family members live in my house and help me pay for my mortgage, otherwise i wouldn't be able to afford it. but when verifying they asked me if i charge them rent or if they help me pay for my mortgage... to me it's all the same since i use their money towards my mortgage. but,  apparently it has to do with how they account for that money. for example, if i charge them rent that money now goes towards my income. however, if they help me pay the mortgage that money is deducted from my expenses and not counted as income. also, when i went into the office the rep mentioned something that i still couldn't wrap my head around; she said that to receive snap and medi-cal, it doesn't matter what i have in the bank or what property i own, that they solely go by the earned income (from a job). does this hold any truth? either way, i still didn't understand the logic behind any of what i just mentioned but i just know that my benefits were reduced significantly. does anyone has any insight on any of this? tia for any and all input.

hi. i lost my husband last year and soon after lost my job. i applied for snap benefits and medi-cal (in riverside county) for my children and i. my case got approved since the only income i was receiving was unemployment and ssa survivor benefits for my children. 

i need to finish setting up benefits from my late husband's pension plan. but it comes with a lump sum amount payable to me, plus his ira earnings rolled over to me, and then a monthly stipend for my children and i.  

i guess my question is, how will all this affect my eligibility with these 2 programs (snap & medi-cal)? how does social services handle lump sum payments? ira rollovers to a surviving spouse? should i just cancel my benefits until i figure all of this out and then reapply for benefits? tia."
"what time is the best? is there a better time to go in to the food stamp office than others? or better day of the week?

also, how is the amount calculated? i read $6 a day for virtual - however i have friends who already get snap benefits and received a huge amount even though their kids went to school in person instead of doing virtual.

"calfresh overissue? hey y’all! i have a quick question to (hopefully) put my mind at ease. when i re-applied for calfresh back in march, i included the income i receive from a contracting job, and didn’t include my income through my second job, which was work-study (my understanding was that work-study is not considered to be income).

last week, i got a letter from calfresh asking for either the pay stubs from the work-study job or verification that it is indeed work-study, or else they would discontinue my benefits. and now that i’m looking around, i’m realizing that this job may not have been work-study after all—it’s part of my academic program, but not officially federal or state work-study.

i feel stupid for the mistake, and am happy to pay back any difference in benefits. i’m just worried that they’ll accuse me of fraud or something. or are they more likely to just take back the overissue? does anyone have experience or perspective on a situation like this? (and of course, i’ve been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with my case worker for days—certainly doesn’t help the anxiety!)

"news: pa college students may now be eligible for snap benefits | fyi for hungry pennsylvanians: snap income limit increased [abc 27 article](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-college-students-may-now-be-eligible-for-snap-benefits/)

this policy was actually released to the county assistance offices back in june, but dhs appears to have formally announced it to the public today to coincide with the start of the fall semester.

for more details beyond what the article provides, you can reference [ops memo 23-06-01](http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/oimpolicymanuals/snap/snap_eligibility_for_students_23-06-01.pdf).

per the memo, already approved ""e&t-equivalent"" programs include:

* [trio upward bound](https://www.patrio.org/ub)
* [gearup](https://www.pagearup.org/)
* [elect](https://www.education.pa.gov/policy-funding/federalprograms/elect/pages/default.aspx)
* [title ii adult basic education](https://www.education.pa.gov/postsecondary-adult/adult%20and%20family%20literacy%20education/pages/legislation.aspx)
* [chafee education and training grant](https://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/other-educational-aid/chafee-program.shtml)

if you participated in any of these programs *prior to starting college*, pa dhs will treat you as meeting a snap student exemption.

if you *currently* participate in an [act 101 program](https://www.pheaa.org/partner-access/schools/act-101.shtml) or receive a [fostering independence tuition waiver (aka fostered)](https://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/other-educational-aid/foster-education.shtml), pa dhs will also treat you as meeting a snap student exemption.

as the article describes, pa dhs also established a process for colleges to submit additional ""e&t-equivalent"" programs that meet certain guidelines to dhs for consideration.  if dhs agrees the submitted program meets the criteria, it'll be added to the list.

per pa dhs's [new snap student website](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/services/assistance/pages/snap-for-college-students.aspx), in order to receive snap, a college student must:

1. meet all normal snap eligibility requirements (e.g. - income limits);
2. not have a meal plan (or have a meal plan that provides 10 or fewer meals per week); **and**
3. meet a student exemption (such as, [but not limited to](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/services/assistance/pages/snap-for-college-students.aspx#exemptions), the ones described above).

back in 2018, dhs also [expanded student eligibility](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/docs/publications/oim%20pcs%20and%20ops%20memos/ops-18-03-04.docx) to community college students in career-focused majors.

really proud of my state (commonwealth\*) for its continued work on student eligibility!

from a [pa department of human services press release](https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/dhs_details.aspx?newsid=857):

>	effective october 1, pennsylvania will increase the income threshold for all applicants to 200 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines (fpig). with this change, more than 420,000 additional pennsylvanians in more than 174,000 households will be newly eligible for snap and will receive, on average, $63 a month.

pa families with at least one elderly (60+) or disabled household member were already subject to a 200% fpig income limit, but for everyone else, the income limit is increasing from 160% fpig to 200% fpig.

this change is **in addition** to the annual cost-of-living (ie inflation) update to income limits and benefit amounts, which will also go into effect on october 1.

tl;dr: if you live in pa and were recently denied due to being a bit over the gross income limit, it might make sense to reapply starting october 1!"

"va — third rejection my third time applying for ebt. i am a college student fully independent and work 18-20 hrs per week. can’t imagine getting another job rn i’m in my senior year taking 5 upper level classes and trying to get through everything and get a degree asap.  in the last two years i tried to apply once and was rejected for not completing an interview even though no one reached out to me to schedule an interview. i applied again and was rejected due to having income over the income limit. they grossly over calculated my wage and salary i don’t know how but said i was making above the upper limit (on my 20 hr/week job??). i went to fill in another app after being told i had to submit a change in income but i never even finished it bc i got so fed up. 

this year i said fuck it i really need food let me try again. a month after i turned in my application no updates nothing. calling 311, case worker, went to dss office called legal aid to get my decision nobody picks up the phone or they tell me i have to talk to my case worker who has never answered the phone. month and two weeks after submitting, i got a letter requesting proof of residency went in and submitted my dl. two months after initial submission, still calling around still no updates and no contact with case worker no one can give me a decision or answer questions. application online still says pending this whole time. now a little over two months checked my portal again and saw i was rejected for the third time. no explanation but i wouldn’t be surprised if it’s another “failed to interview”. just at a loss feel like crying and so fed up with this system. what to do?"
"my ebt card paid for our beer and i'm confused hey guys. so we just went to the grocery store and got some food...everything we got we knew would be covered by the food stamps besides a 6 pack of beer. i pulled out a $20 to pay for that, and then see our remaining balance was $2. this was for the bottle fee and for the bags (i'm in oregon and we have to pay for our bags lol). why did the food stamps cover the beer?! i feel like this was a mess up? i even asked the cashier and made sure the beer scanned, but she didn't seem to understand my question haha. 

additionally, my card reloads on the 9th of the month. it reloaded on the 9th, and then seemingly reloaded again a week later. i just got this card this month and i am so confused lol. my concern is there is some mess up and eventually i'll be told i owe then money because they gave me too much, or because it paid for things i shouldn't have. does anyone know what's happening?"
"current wait times for snap and ca in nyc? anyone have an update on what the wait times are for the dual application? trying to help someone out who applied approx 75 days ago. and they still haven’t heard back. they did get a paper saying their “immediate need” (for a one shot deal) was declined, but otherwise there have been zero updates on the snap and ca part of their application. 

they have called the card balance hotline, and checked the hra app. and were apparently told by the interviewer when they first applied back in june that they should start receiving money in a week. clearly that didn’t happen!"

edited to add that i copied the statement from the middle of a sentence on the website linked; i know that that comma shouldn't be there and reddit won't let me edit the subject line!"
how soon will i hear back? im from nc and i applied right before christmas. im married with a one year old and im the only one supporting my family due to my husbands business going under. im so desperate for snap but i don’t know how much longer i can wait :/
"discontinued benefits... should i reapply? alameda county

i turned in my sar 7 late and now my benefits have been discontinued, i was wondering if i can reapply for calfresh?"
"i wonder how much grocery stores & farm companies spend on food stamp lobbyists? i have lived in different states in different parts of the country but liberal places. i never hear politicians talk down snap. occasionally there is talk about allowing only certain foods to be purchased with them similar to wic but it never goes anywhere. closest is the 50% supplement for vegetables & such purchased at farmed markets. i am absolutely convinced that walmart, kroger, etc & corn growers will always make sure that food stamps are funded & with no restrictions especially sugar. 18% of all snap goes to walmart. it’s interesting if you think about it"
"how to get case re-opened my case has been closed for about 3 weeks after a renewal. after 3 weeks of constant friendly contact with my local dfacs (ga) my benefits have been reinstated. i wanted to share how. 

1. upload and hand deliver requested documents in a timely manner.
2. make sure you get receipt via screen shot for uploaded documents and a receipt for hand deliveries. 
3. always remain polite and pleasant, we are all humans and they have difficulties in life as well. you will brighten their day with your optimism.
4. call and leave a message to your caseworker often. if they haven't contacted you in a few days, call their supervisor. these are need based programs and many people apply so keep contacting them. 
5. go to the office  or call and confirm that the caseworker is available and see if the receptionist can set up an appointment for you to speak with your caseworker.
6. if you haven't received any letter or phone call, contact the supervisor of the supervisor of your caseworker to let her know what's going on. 
7. i know it can be frustrating because we apply for these benefits because we are in need, but remain polite, friendly and always have proof for any income you receive, so as to not have any delay in benefits.
8. many times in my area caseworkers make mistakes and close cases, look over your paperwork for any inconsistencies and try to self-edit. if your caseworker states any untrue info regarding what you sent in or that they didn't receive it, kindly inform them of the receipts. hopefully your case will be re-opened and you get the benefits your family needs good luck!"
"does the federal minimum wage increase need to be reported? the federal minimum wage in new york state just went up a dollar. does it need to be reported, or is that kind of thing worked into snap? 

thanks in advance!"
hi! i am in michigan i have 2 kids and i’m a stay at home mom. my boyfriend works and he just got a 1$ raise at the beginning of the month. i’m worried about letting them know the 1$ change because i don’t want it to affect our benefits that come on saturday. does anyone know if they will stop them over a 1$ pay change? we also won’t be over the income limit for michigan.  thanks for any help!!
"food stamp interview tomorrow. advice? i am part time worker, 19, planning to go to cosmetology school soon, and i recently applied for food stamps because i don’t make enough money for food. only enough for bills and ubers to get to work. i’m extremely nervous on whether or not i’ll be approved. i really need this to work out for me because i hate having to rely on the free food from my job. i live in louisiana. any advice or things i should know about the interview?


update: i had my phone interview and the lady on the phone conducting my interview was rude and had a stank attitude. i have to fill out a lot of paperwork in order to qualify and i’m not feeling too great about it. the dcfs office for my state has awful reviews."
calling the county has anyone else been having issues getting through the county phone line and speaking with a rep. i woke up at 8 30 and called at 8 35 just to be told there is a high volume of calls and i can't speak to anyone. i been at it for 2 hours and this same thing happened to me about 2 weeks ago. i'm in contra costa. it there another number or way to speak with a rep about my case!?!?!?
"using snap across state lines? hi all! my snap is in minnesota. i have to travel out of state periodically, and when i do i use my snap card in local grocery stores, which i know i’m allowed to do. but i’ve now gotten 2 letters questioning my residency, and have had to go in and verify my address at the benefits office each time. 

the staff there act like it’s not a big deal - i bring in mail with my address on it and it all works out. but one of them mentioned offhandedly that if this happens too often i could lose my benefits. i tried to ask her how often is too often, but she just kind of shrugged. 

does anyone have experience with this? do you know “how often is too often?” i have no choice but to travel out of state again next week, and i’m nervous that using my card will cause problems. 

thanks so much!"
"new to ebt hi there, this is my first time getting an ebt card and my limit is $281. (i reside in san diego county) my question is: is there a daily limit to how much you can spend? i’ve had multiple instances where i’ll get groceries/household items at vons/walmart and my total isn’t fully covered. for ex: i spent $107 on groceries today at walmart and my ebt only covered $53 while i have over $200 in my account. why is this? thanks in advance."
"does my adult son have a chance at being accepted for food stamps? my son, who lives with me and is supported by my financially, is 23 years old and suffers from small nerve fiber neuropathy. it affects his ability to work and have a normal life. we are in the starting process of filing for disability. my question is, will he be able to apply for food stamps as an adult without them considering my income? someone advised that he should apply using a different address. is that even an option? he has no job, no income, and relies on me for everything. is there a chance he could get it? we live in massachusetts, and any advice will be greatly appreciated. 🙏🏾"
"why were my ebt and gr discontinued? it says

you did not give proof of your income from work.

you earned money above the gr income limit of $221.00.

no i didn't. where did they get this info?"
"mortgage question my husband and i have gotten tired of living in somewhat sketchy apartments because sometimes the neighbors are trashy or smoke inside their apt and the smell comes thru our vents. it’s gotten to the point where i just can’t stand it cause i have little ones. my mom must have noticed my exasperation cause she told my dad who said he could co sign on a mortgage loan. the reason why i need a co-signer is cause i don’t work and my husband is undocumented so he can’t get a loan.i talked to one lender who told me that they could give me two options that largely depend on his income and credit. 1. my dad would be the only one on the loan yet the house title would be in my name only. 2. we could both be on the loan with my dad being the primary borrower. my question is, how would i go proving my housing costs (i currently get snap so i’d have to update my housing cost since it would no longer be rent) in both scenarios especially with the first one since i wouldn’t be on the loan. and in both cases theyd want to know if my dad lives with us which he wouldn’t. my husband would be the one paying the mortgage my dad would just be the co-signer so we can buy a house and finally get out of these trashy apts."
"help | help please hello everyone, i made a post last week but i just ended up even more confused after talking to an agent. someone told me that if it’s discontinued i have to re-apply right? im assuming thats what this means, please help 😢

hello everyone. i need help trying to figure out what im supposed to do because these call centers are hours of waiting 💔for context i did not know you were supposed to do the sar7, i received it in the mail but i didn’t think i had to fill it out because my income didn’t change. it has almost been a year since i applied for food stamps, should i still try to renew the sar7 (im pretty sure that option isn’t even available anymore) or should i just reapply for calfresh benefits?? if anyone can help i would appreciate it 💯"
"selling on ebay due to my husband passing away, i haven't been able to go back to work. i'm not psychologically ready and my children need me to be available for them. so to pay bills i started to sell stuff on ebay. my own stuff, clothes, shoes, tools, random stuff from the house. when it was time to renew my benefits, of course i reported my ebay earnings because i wanted to show that i am working even though it's not a typical job. now they want all types of ""business"" information. a schedule ""c"" that i don't even know what it is, receipts (i haven't purchased anything other than ink for my printer), business name, tax information, income for the past 3 months. i dont have a ""business"", like i said pretty much just cleaning out my closets and garage! i sent them a copy of my monthly ebay earnings printed from the ebay  website and they said it wasn't good enough. i submitted my renewal info by the due date and it took them a month to get back to me. i haven't received my snap for this month. i need to call to ask all these questions but i don't want to spend the whole day in hold! does anyone have any information on reporting ebay income? i live in florida."
my general relief only paid me 92 bucks. i have had gr and ebt for years. i'm homeless and unemployed and here in la they just hand out ebt to anyone out here who is experiencing some sort of hardship. but i haven't changed any information or made any changes. my recertification starts in august and hasn't been released yet.. i'm hoping tomorrow i can call when there open and it's just a mess up on there end. has this happen to anyone else? is there something i missing? or is this just my luck
"[mn] girlfriend left household. county is making it very hard to get snap now. i had a snap case with my (now ex) girlfriend and our 2 children. my girlfriend left our household mid july. she got a job and moved into an apartment in a new county. she left our children, and they remain in the household with me.

&#x200b;

i called the county. explained the situation and asked if i could simply remove her from the household. they told me ""sorry no, you need to re-apply."" so, i did. i finished the phone interview. later the same day, my worker called me and said ""so.... you're not eligible for ebt benefits. because your dependents are already on another case.... and you can't get benefits for them 2 times. sorry about that....""

i again, explained to her the case they were on previously, is the exact same address, income, and people. the only difference is my ex girlfriend left the household. she told me ""well, the case is in her name. she'll need to verify she left the household. sorry. you can reapply in the future.""

it took the county a month after i reapplied to get the phone interview done. my ex girlfriend moved multiple counties away and got a job that puts her over the income limit for snap."
"when to report changes - calfresh hello, my family has been very fortunate to receive calfresh benefits during a difficult period in our lives. thankfully, my partner has received a job offer that will mean we will no longer be eligible for these benefits. when do i report these changes though? the new job doesn't start until the new year and even then he won't be getting paid right away and we will still need to buy groceries until he is. i want to make sure i do the right thing, but i also want to make sure we're covered until his paychecks start coming in. thank you.

edit: should i use as much of the money that is on my card while i still can or is that in poor taste?

edit2: i am in santa clara county

"nj general assistance | nj general assistance? i have a valid med1 for general assistance but i just received a letter sayin i have to do the 28 day program i was hoping someone could tell me if i will receive retroactive cash assistance? i applied in september and had my dr fax in paper work multiple times but they kept sayin they didn't get it. recently i took them a hard copy and they are working on my case now. will i receive cash assistance from all the past months when it goes threw.

i thought that was the point of having a med1 form. i have a valid med1 for a year but i still just received something saying i have to do the 28day program as well as sign the ssi repayment form. my question is could this just be a generic letter that is sent to everyone?"
"list of discounts/perks for folks with ebt in california hello!

we just qualified for calfresh (california version of snap) and medi-cal (ca version of medicaid) and have been trying to find all sorts of benefits that are now open to us. it seems like companies intentionally don't advertise these and i couldn't find a good comprehensive list so i made my own!

credit card as expenses i noticed medicaid on there application for nyc you can add the credit card monthly payment as a expense but not on food stamps why is that or maybe i'm wrong do they take credit card payments as an expense for food stamp
"will i get jail time is i don’t report a income on snap application? been getting food stamps for 2 years. about 8 months ago i got a new job that pays decent money however right now i’m struggling.

i have about 3 jobs right now. job 1 and 2 pays minimum wage with the hours i get there along with how high my rent is id qualify for max benefits 

however if i include job 3 either id get no benefits at all or it’s be severely reduced.

my question is would snap find out if i 
 only included my 2 minimum wage jobs in my application and left out the 3rd one?

also if it makes any difference i didn’t file my taxes for 2022 so they wouldn’t know about my new job through that"
"my family got robbed worth of food stamps, is there any way to find the perpetrator? so for context, my family had a large sum of food stamps saved up over the years (we have our reasons, nothing illegal). we check our account in the morning and it shows a $0 balance and obviously we got robbed, i would say scammed but we didn't partake in any games or any of that sort. we see three transactions one as a test for less than a dollar and the other two splitting the rest of the available money and a declined transaction coming out from houston. assuming the culprit used some sort of physical device to get my card info at a self-checkout and peeked over my shoulder for my pin, would there be any catch this monster? it just really makes me mad that this thief would steal from low-income households (assuming i'm not the only one) and get away with it? we talked to the appropriate departments and we're only getting a small portion of the full amount back. so, if there is any way you guys can suggest tracing the transactions back to him or any service that would do so, it would be much appreciated. i am not responding to pm's, only suggestions in the comments! thanks!"

"california ebt benefit reduction i live in california (la county) and have had ebt for a couple of years now. i’ve been hit with a lot of bs during this time from the dpss but what happened last month doesn’t make any sense and i’m wondering if this happened to anyone else. i am a grad student so i am only able to work 20 hours a week, which is the minimum required of students on ebt. my internship only pays minimum wage and as a result, i was receiving max benefits. i had to do my verification of income reporting in february and when they had reviewed it in march, they told me that my benefits were being reduced by $50 dollars due to an increase in my overall income. the increase in question is the state mandated 50 cent increase to minimum wage in california that went into effect in january. relatively speaking, im in the same position that i was before, along with everyone else making minimum wage. i called my case worker to see if this was factored in and they said yes. i don’t see how that is true as i hit the bare minimum qualifications to have ebt, meaning that im in the same boat as all other part time student workers making minimum wage. did everyone else in this position also see a $50 reduction? 

tldr
how does the state mandated 50 cent increase to minimum wage starting in january in california count as an increase in overall income, resulting in a $50 loss in benefits even though i’m still making minimum wage?"
salary or monthly hello! i have arizona snap ebt right now and i’m in the process of renewing my application. i’m wondering if my student loans will affect how much benefits i receive and if i’m supposed to report them. also what do i do if my job is seasonal for example i have a job on campus that is not available during the summer and during breaks? do i report annual salary instead and update them after i successfully landed a summer job?
"denied | michigan | extra benefit in mi??? got denied because my gross income was above the limit but they didn’t even count everyone in my household?

hi again! so i did my redetermination interview like a few weeks ago and sent all the required documents, called and they said i should have a decision by the end of august. well end of august is here and no decision. does it take this long? my benefits usually come in on the 11th of each month

hi! so for some reason i got a random $380 deposit on my ebt card randomly two days ago??? i’m in michigan has anyone experienced this?"
"has anyone written a collateral letter before? what should i put on it? | my last employer won't fill out loss of income form (florida) | i was denied because they wouldn't answer their phones. [snap, fl] i'm having a friend write a collateral letter since my former employer won't fill out the loss of income form. i'm not sure what my friend should write exactly. does anyone have suggestions or an outline she can follow?

some background, i left my last job due to another opportunity. while waiting for my drug test to come back for my new job, they hired someone else and rescinded their job offer, leaving me without a job. i have a family, so i quickly re-applied for ebt (i was always receiving it but only getting about 15 bucks a month). they're now requesting i fill out a loss of income form and when i asked my last employer, they refused to fill it out because they technically didn't terminate me, i left willingly. i'm not sure what to do now. is there a way around this?

i was sent a letter to call and have my phone interview; and for about a week, i called and called and called and left several messages throughout the day, each day and no one got back to me. i even called after my deadline but still, nothing. now, they've denied me, saying i didn't complete my phone interview and that it was my responsibility and blah blah. anyway, i'm trying to reapply but they're not giving me the option at all, whatsoever. does anyone know how long until i can reapply again? is there anyone i could contact in the meantime?

&#x200b;

**update:** since my case had already been denied, and the offices where i live are closed and refusing to answer any calls, i did receive an email to go to this link to request an appeal ([https://www.myflfamilies.com/about-us/office-inspector-general/appeal-hearings/fair-hearing-request-form.shtml](https://www.myflfamilies.com/about-us/office-inspector-general/appeal-hearings/fair-hearing-request-form.shtml))

hopefully, i'll hear back from someone by monday.

**updated two:** i was scheduled to have a hearing on dec. 17th, but luckily, someone called me today (december 1st) and gave me my phone interview. i am now receiving food stamps again. thank you so much for your help everyone!"
"out of state grad student i know students aren’t typically allowed to get food stamps, but i work 20 hours a week for my program so i should be eligible. i’m from the west coast, still have residency (voting, id, driver’s license, etc) there, but am at school in massachusetts. would i apply for food stamps in mass? would that cause any problems for my residency?"
"no interview notification, just a random call, from random numbers, at a random time of day. i'm pretty disappointed right now as i've missed two phone interviews. the problem is they don't give any sort of notification that an interview is coming. they just call at random. the only reason i even know that the call was for a potential interview is because when i dial the number back a few minutes later, the voicemail greeting mentions dss. i leave a voicemail with my info but get no response back.

are scheduled interviews no longer a thing for snap benefits?

after the first missed interview i called dss sc connect number and waited 2 hrs on the phone to request another interview. i'm going to do the same again today and see what happens. i'm not sure how many interview attempts i can receive without getting denied."
"what’s the source of the rule that benefits get auto extended right now due to public health emergency? i just had my benefits cancelled (ny) because i missed some paperwork i was supposed to mail in, but i keep seeing this referenced on here.

is there something i can quote or reference when calling them or asking for a hearing on the decision to end my benefits? why would they do this if they’re supposed to not cancel anyone right now?"
what's going on in texas? i applied february 16 for snap benefits and my application is not being processed. it's been over a month. i called them twice and each time the case worker said they escalated my case and to wait for something in the mail. this is getting ridiculous.
got approved but worried... got let go from failed drug test will i still get approved? i live in fl got a 5 year old boy...snap wants loss of job stuff i'm just worried that will deny me...?
"questions regarding benefit fraud. 1. **include the state you are in.**

2. please comment the names of all apps you use to access, check the balance or make purchases with your benefits that are not the official agency app or website.

3. what has your experience been with fraud and what, if any, unusual events happened around the time your benefits were stolen?

4. what is your opinion on how this is happening?"

"food stamps as an adult college student i am 26 years old in the state of nc, live with my parents, but help monthly with rent, utilities, and groceries. i start college full time in 3 weeks and i am paying for tuition by myself. i work 20-25 hours a week but i average maybe $1300 a month so i am seeking government assistance. would i qualify for food stamps? should i wait until i am enrolled in college \[and paying tuition on a payment plan\] to apply, or would doing it sooner benefit my situation? i am applying for fns as an individual since my parents do not/cannot support me financially, but since i help them with living expenses could that increase my benefits? tia!"
"recreating my post. i live in california and the allotoment max is $1,800 before taxes. i had a rep tell me i actually make a gross income of $1,950 per the state. i already take out the deducted amount so i’m actually less than $1,800 monthly. i’m capped at the $1,800 per the ui site. what can i do to resolve this when i call in for an appeal?"
"ny extra benefit deposit - what’s going on? i live in ny and woke up to a ton of extra food stamps this morning! as far as i know, there’s zero reason for this - extra allotment is over, i am not owed any back pay for p-ebt, my regular allotment  was already deposited… i have no idea what this is for. a friend of mine also got a bunch of extra. does anyone know why? and, if it’s a glitch, will it be taken away? my friend’s like, “they can’t take it away once they give it to you!” but, this is nys. i’m pretty sure they can, and will. 😂"
"what non-food items are snap ebt eligible, and how can i find them out? on amazon, recently i've noticed that several non-food items are snap ebt eligible, like the ""aerogarden bounty basic"" which allows you go grow salad greens, etc, indoors. also, products like mushroom logs are also eligible.  


it appears that some products that are related to gardening and one growing their own food are eligible. what other products are eligible or how can i find out more information about eligible products that aren't necessarily directly edible but have to do with gardening and growing your own food?"
"approved for snap good news! i finally had my phone interview.  we are 3 bucks over the limit. but by some freaking grace of god, in part due to hubby's insane high and recurring medical bills to long to go into here... for a family of 4 me hubby our 2 kids we get 175 a month in tanf state medicaid and 80 bucks a month in snap.  the cash will pay our light or water bill and the 80 in ebt is going to give us some breathing room"
"would i qualify? currently my dad (who receives about $1100 per month of ssi & social security combined) is getting $167 per month of snap. we live together but since he has so many medical issues & dietary needs, i cook his meals separately from mine. my gross income is about $2,500 per month, which puts me just out of range to qualify for snap. what i'm wondering is if i were to apply as a household with my dad would that qualify me for snap and maybe raise the amount over the $167 dad already gets? we're relatively new to this so i don't know how this all works.

edit: i'm in california."

texas: can someone please tell why hhsc is requesting this (you weren't able to prove your identity during the phone interview. you must go to an hhsc benefits office to show proof of your identity. to find an office near you) the thing is i never got a phone call and i know they have my info since me and my children where approved for medicaid. do i still need to go or can i just upload this on my app?

"balance went down within 1 day after receiving card hi guys! so i got my snap ebt card through calfresh just within the past week and registered it to my amazon account. when i checked my balance through amazon it said my balance was $260 so naturally i added roughly $258 worth to my cart all snap eligible. 

but when i went to check out and clicked on my snap card to be used it suddenly showed that my balance was $226. i took some stuff out and checked out but i was a little confused.

i tried registering the card to look at the balance/perhaps see transactions but was met with the error message. i was really worried that someone had stolen the info despite no one getting access to the card and i had only registered it on amazon.

however, upon rechecking my letter from the county it said i would only be getting $226 for august - so was the $260 just an error? why did it reflect a different balance initially?

and has anyone else bypassed the error msg when trying to register the card?"

im not 60 or disabled but they say anyone on my case. i live with my older folks but they aren't on food stamps. im the only one on food stamps so i just say no correct?

under job income their asking about how much i made in august before taxes but i literally made less than a thousand is that worth answering?

"update: usps ripped my food stamps mail in half and delivered it a week after the deadline. | usps ripped my food stamps mail and delivered it a week after the deadline. okay, so first a correction: i mistakenly said ssa in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/vwatl0/usps_ripped_my_food_stamps_mail_and_delivered_it?sort=confidence) but as someone pointed out, ssa isn't in charge of that, it was the nevada dhss.

i'm okay and did not lose my food stamps. an agent on the phone informed me and my case manager that the deadline is actually the 31st, not the 1st. they just put that on the letter to (i assume) make sure they get it on time. my case manager very kindly taped together the pages while i filled them out, and after going home to print out some stuff to prove my income and work hours i returned and she faxed it to them. moral of the story, don't panic when shit happens. welfare offices (or nevada's, at least) are more lenient than other government bodies. thanks to everyone who commented on my original post, and i hope things get better for all of us. 💖

i am beyond furious. i will be calling my case manager tomorrow to see what i can do about this. the entire envelope was torn in an arc that suggests an employee did it by hand, not by a machine. the envelope contained the proof of income forms that needed to be in the ssa office last week. will i lose my food stamps over this, and if so will i have any course of action against the usps for this? my food stamps balance is still available, should i stock up? 

interesting how the 20 pieces of junk mail my grandma gets every day alway miraculously arrive in one piece, but the big important envelope from literally the government gets destroyed by hand and arrives late."

"california glitch causing skipped month | calfresh deposit never came | ca benefits not deposited second month in a row i was supposed to receive my benefits on the 7th, but when i went to buy groceries the card declined. i called and was told that there was a marking on my account to skip the month of may with no note as to why, and that my case would be sent to a supervisor for an override. i was told on this call that i should have my benefits by the 12th. the 12th came and went with no update and no money, so once the weekend was over i called again. this time i was told that my benefits had been skipped because of a glitch in the system, and that no supervisors had looked at my case yet. the representative then submitted a second request for a supervisor to override the skip and told me that it was marked as urgent and i should receive my benefits soon.

it seems like nothing is actually happening with my case. i'm pretty much completely out of food and no one in the office cares. i asked what i was supposed to do while i wait weeks past the time i was supposed to get my benefits and they just said to ask friends or family for food. does anyone have recommendations on how to get them to actually do something about what they have already admitted is an issue on their end, not mine?

edit: this is in la county

my benefits are supposed to be deposited on the 7th of every month, but nothing came today (yesterday technically since it's after midnight). i was approved around two months ago, so it definitely isn't a recertification issue. i checked my account on benefits cal and everything looks normal, it still lists my monthly amount and shows that my recertification isn't due for a while.

has anyone else in california had any issues with late deposits? i've never had this happen before (i was just approved for this round of ebt two months ago, but was on it for a few years a while back so i've had a lot of deposits). i'm going to call my local office as soon as they open in the morning, but i was just wondering if anyone had any idea of what the problem might be.

edit: i'm in los angeles county.

i've posted in here about this issue before, but i thought it was all resolved and i guess it isn't. my benefits weren't deposited last month on the 7th like they were supposed to be, and i was told it was due to a glitch in the system. i had to call every day for 2.5 weeks to get my benefits last month, and i was told a supervisor would be calling me several times but none ever did. i recently started working different hours, so now i have to take time off of work in order to call every time i have an issue since the wait time is usually 2-4 hours on hold. i can't afford to do this, and my job won't allow me to. what am i supposed to do if a supervisor never calls me back? who can i contact to get this fixed? i can't afford to not know when or if i'll be getting my benefits each month.

"urgent alameda social services food stamp help hello, to preface i am currently in medical school. several of my classmates were supposed to have our interviews  this month and last month regarding renewals of our ebt. 

weeks leading up to my interview date of 7/24 i made sure i called(left voice mail) 7 times to confirm if they have received my paperwork. unfortunately nobody picked up all those times. yesterday, i did not receive a call. i called back 5 times and left 2 voicemails on 7/24 and never received a callback. just now, i received a discontinued status on mybenefitscalwin.

strangely, this also happened to my class mates who had an interview on july 3rd and did not receive a call  for their interview. to this day they have not received a call back even after calling back everyday.

luckily we have a food pantry in school, but due to low stock there isn't enough food to last each student a week

since we're in the hospital everyday from 7am to 6pm there isnt a way for us to visit the offices. is there any way for us to file a complaint or grievance? it really frustrates me that i set aside 30 minutes for my interview only to be sent a notice that i missed the interview."

"chip texas | medicaid/chip texas household of 5 (3 kids) i recently renewed and i check the app status with says that they are denied. i called and said it was do to income limit. so i decided to go through healthcare.gov and after the application it says that we are eligible for chip? called hhs and they told me to apply again. my husband income varies a lot since he sometimes works out of state so yes his check is higher sometimes due to perdem which he uses for expenses. i'm a bit confused and don't know what steps to take, my kids benefits end this month. can someone please help me or guide me through this issue?

we are a one income family of 5. my kids had been receiving medicaid (8yr,6yrs,10mths) which was up for renewal. today i logged into the app and saw that all three of my kids were denied medicaid and only my older 2 were under a tab of chip with pending enrollment. i called 211 amd they said that the are requesting 4 checkstubs from my husband. we are in a situation right now were this past month his pay was significantly higher due to him working out of the state and he was receiving per diem. i'm afraid that it will drastically change the outcome of our kids receiving any benefits. him leaving isn't a normal thing. it was completely a rare thing so idk what i can do to show that since the last for check stubs are from him getting that extra pay. any help or advice would be appreciated. thank you!"

"snap overpayment tx i recieved a letter in the mail stating that i owe 9,133 to hhsc because i didn’t report the correct household size. they have my kids father listed as a member of my household and he’s not. on all my snap records i put that he pays my rent and light bill as a agreement between him and i. he is only on the lease at the house because i didn’t have enough rental history to sign on my own. i can not afford this debt nor do i feel responsible for it.i requested a legal aid . 


i called the number to request a fair hearing. no one has responded or given me a call back . i also mailed a letter requesting a hearing in the mail.

how often does these scenarios work in the favor of the snap recipient?

"child support in california i'm going through a divorce and will be receiving child support. i was looking into how that factors into receiving assistance, calfresh i think, and it looks like the child support will be taken as reimbursement? sorry if this is dumb, there wasn't much information i could find on this topic but the little i did find made it seem like essentially, the child support payments fund the food stamps. in which case i guess i'm wondering wouldn't it make more sense to not get assistance and just use the child support money? if anyone in california who is receiving child support and food stamps could let me know how that works i would really appreciate it.

"snap & immigration hi all, i am wondering if you can advise me. 

background: i am a student and my spouse lives overseas (he is not a us citizen). we filed for his greencard which has been approved and he is finally able to move to the us. for the last few months i have been receiving snap benefits as i qualify being a student with no income. my spouse has been supporting me by paying my rent and living expenses (while also paying his own rent and living expenses). in the last few months i have accrued over $2000 in food stamps and have spent a total of $350 of them. the reason being was i was scared that they would 1. affect immigration and 2. i thought maybe i was mistakenly approved as i do have a spouse. he technically was not in my household, does not have a social security number, and does not earn an income in the us. 

my question: was i allowed to use that $350? is that considered snap fraud as i do have a spouse or am i overthinking it? i genuinely needed those benefits to pay for food (i spent about $70 a month on groceries to try to keep my costs as low as possible)

i am calling to close my case on sunday when he moves to usa and my household income changes, but i am wondering what i should say and if i have done anything wrong. 

thanks in advance for all your help."

"washington eligible for $0 after recertification - do i still get emergency benefits? hi everyone, 

thank you for taking the time to read this. i've called dshs a few times to get this clarified but i'm paranoid to say the least. 

long story short, i completed my recertification earlier this month and i went from $29 a month to $0. they told me that if maximum emergency benefits are approved i should continue to get the max amount but once that expires we no longer receive benefits. now, i would normally take what they say at face value but i'm not confident and i'm hoping to hear from someone in my situation that has received benefits with a $0 amount approved. my case appears to be active and per the state website it makes mention of households approved for $0 receiving the full amount but i guess i need reassurance to really feel secure in this answer. i know it's silly but life has been very difficult for us(like many of us) and these benefits have been a life saver for us.



edit: i can confirm that my balance is now showing as $509 on washington's benefit website. :)"

"do they remove cash if the balance gets too high? my mother has been on a restricted diet for about a year. i do all her shopping and she also receives meals on wheels every day.

she also eats like a mouse. just some nibbles here and there.

at the beginning of this month i checked all her finances like i always do and she had $2800 and change on the card. 

then it got loaded with another $280 and the balance is still $2800.

so there is a years worth of benefits on the card right now.

i do use the card for her but they are small things when i visit. usually something sweet. and remotely to order via amazon or instacart. sparingly.

her ability to eat should be back one of these days and i sure do hope they don't just up and cancel it on her for a year of illness.

so on friday i checked the benefits portal to see when our calworks deposit would be made and came across a letter they issued saying that our calworks was in the process of being deposited to our bank account. problem is, we never requested that they direct deposited our assistance to that bank account, as it had a negative balance and with children, need all the money we can receive. to make matter worse, when i checked our bank account, the bank closed down our account without telling us and don't know when they closed it or what happened to those assistance funds.

i've tried calling our worker and the bank, but given the holiday no one is in. left messages, etc., and plan on calling our worker first thing tomorrow as well.

while i wait, i was just trying to ascertain whether they do offer benefit replacements for folks typically and if not, would they be able to given the fact that we never requested direct deposit, our bank account is closed and we have no other source of income right now?

"ohio snap benefit drops in october- can i still find a way to get additional funds for snap? | (ohio)- snap benefits question: increase in benefits i was given a ohio direction snap benefit card for ohio food stamps. i told in a letter i would get $44 a month. but because of the pandemic; i was given the maximum amount of $235/month each month. of course in september the 'extra' ends; and october we do get that permanent raise (not sure what i will get then). anyways, the $235/month really helped a lot! i always wondered how they expected $44 to help me each month. it helps some-yes, but it really doesn't ""truly help"". i told them i get $814 a month on ssi. i told them i pay $300 a month in rent. however; their 'formula/calculations' determined i get only $44.  i additionally pay a cell phone bill (for myself) among other things. but apparently they do not 'care' about the additional things you pay?!  
   
i am worried what will occur in october; when it drops. basically will it even be enough. is their anything i can do to seek even slightly more funds?

i sent a email to my case manager's assistant last week (around october 8th) that i currently get snap ebt benefits; have been getting them for awhile. however; i have been helping pay (splitting bills) with my roommate now. aka..electric, internet, garbage, etc). she sent me a email back saying ""thanks for letting her know, she would forward the email to the case worker to review""....  
my question is; i called the ebt card and it still has the same amount of money 'set' to be placed on the card soon, so no 'increase yet'. i would think they likely will need ""documentation"" of the split bills (that i now pay). which affects my overall income...  
anyways one week later; and still no mail from them (nor email) if they need any additional information.   


\*\*\*\*                                                                                                                                                              \*\*\*\*

how long does it generally take to 'increase' someone's benefit amount when they are getting $xx vs a increase to say $xxx...is it within a month?"

"child support and getting off ebt so i’ve been notified by dss i néed to give info for the father of my child bc they want to collect child support. can i call my caseworker and say i no longer want to receive food stamps and get the case dropped? the father is support the child, he is unemployed and i do not need child support. trying to figure out the best way to get everything closed quickly without raising flags. this is in nc"
they denied my family for food stamps for not submitting the income proof in time even though we submitted it a few days before the deadline. is there anyway around this?
"quick pa question | please help me. i’m in chester county. i can not figure out what date my deposit is supposed to come. the article online said to use the last digit of your case number. i got a piece of mail but it has like 4 different sets of numbers i’m not sure which one is the case id. can anyone help me out. i also saw another article that said it based on the last digit of your ssn.

they canceled my snap because i didn’t send in the form on time, it was due dec 24. i didn’t receive it in the mail until january 11th, that’s their fault not mine right? i was on the phone with the judge today for an appeal. i said i have usps informed delivery setup. i didn’t receive it the mail until jan 11th i can show you. the judge told me unless i could prove it was submitted before december 24th she can’t do anything. so from dec 15 until feb 15 it was canceled. like what???? they are refusing to do the back pay because it was submitted late. i told her i can not submit before i receive it. she said that’s beyond her control. so from december 15 to feb 15 i lost out on about 800 dollars and it was very rough. in september my father passed away. i could have really used the money for groceries. i told the judge despite me having evidence, you essentially said unless i could time travel and send a form before i received it, that this is essentially my fault. i feel helpless and overwhelmed. i can not afford a lawyer. is there anything i could do. for my appeal i defended myself could i get a public defender? is it too late i told the judge if that’s what your saying there is nothing else i can do. she asked if wanted to resign my appeal. i asked was there anything else that could be done she said no unless i could prove it was sent in by dec 24. again i got the for jan 11. i felt helpless and i said i suppose so mam. she said my appeal was pulled and ended the court date. why did the government just fuck me over? i’m in chester county pennsylvania."
do i need to re-apply once i leave college? i just finished my last semester of college and i’m wondering if working more and not being in school will help me get more benefits. i don’t get enough as it is and i barely met the criteria before. does anyone know if i need to apply again to see if i can get more or if it’s even worth it?
"florida snap status, what does this mean?? so i recently reapplied (i missed the date for renewal) and both my children were approved again. they didn't ask for an interview, just documentation (again) of the child support i'm paid, which i uploaded (again)... so that's all good.

however, they have me listed as ineligible and the reason listed is technical_eligibility in_sanction_period. does anyone know that this means?

i think i'm exempt from the able-bodied worker thing because i'm a student and have children? i was last time. my income is basically non-existent. i do have money in the bank but it's all going to rent and bills. nothing has changed since last time except maybe i have less money.

probably more info than needed and i realize i'll probably have to call (ugh), but thought i would first see if anyone knows what the heck technical_eligibility in_sanction_period could mean.

thanks in advance!"
"can i rant about calworks for a sec??? i didnt see anywhere else to post this so i figured i would add it here.. 

so long story short i have state benefits (calfresh/medi-cal) bc i'm pregnant and had to leave my job bc this journey has been rough. so anyways, my friend tells me to apply to calworks because i'm getting worried about funds and it's been hard to find accommodating work while i'm pregnant. so anyways i apply, i know i'm eligible, because the qualifications include being pregnant which i am!!!! and after i have my interview, the person tells me thanks for submitting all the necessary documents and that i should have no issue. well fast forward, at first they were giving me a hard time because although i have lived in california for over a year, i have an out of state driver's license because the dmv was always closed whenever i was working and there was no way for me to get over there and i dont have a car here so i didnt see a point in transferring my license until i absolutely needed to ...so because of that i think the process took longer, but i have a lease in california and i have worked two jobs here too like i am a california resident. anyways fast forward and they deny me. i'm like huh?? and they said it's because i don't meet the criteria, but i do and sent in my pregnancy verification. now the lady at the appeals is being super rude the first time she calls me. she's basically condescending like i'm trying to fraud the system, implying that i'm a liar asking me all these questions about my pregnancy being sarcastic - i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. she says that they never received my pregnancy verification and i'm telling her i submitted it along with my baby's genetic testing which also states i'm pregnant sooooo ????? so i already know there's not use trying to reason with her even tho on my benefits portal it clearly says all my documents that were uploaded and then she says to reupload it, and i do. then she calls me back and apologizes because she misread my file wrong and it does in fact state that i am pregnant. she told me she would do some digging and find out why it was denied etc. so she calls the welfare office or whatever and told me that they tried saying i didnt upload the document until yesterday and the lady thank god advocates for me because they're trying to say i didnt upload any documents and she basically tells them f\*ck no that's not true, stating that i uploaded everything in a timely manner. after she realizes i did everything correctly, her demeanor towards me changed. but i'm just annoyed that this even happened. like this process has now taken almost 2 months. i'm pregnant and terrified and all alone here in california like i don't need more stress of people questioning my character thinking im trying to abuse the system when i actually need help rn .. so anyways she told me they're willing to resubmit my application and approve it because it was an error on their end. thank god but still mildly frustrating.

has this happened to anyone else in california?"
"do i need to call to let them know i got a new job that will disqualify me from receiving food stamps. i already sent in the documents on the app (tx) i have gotten a better job that will send me over the monthly allowed limit for myself. i know this will cut off my food stamps. i submitted my first paystub from the job when i got paid on march 3rd and updated my job info and deleted the job i did have. today was my second payday at the new job and i just submitted that paystub as well. the one i sent on the 3rd still hasn’t been viewed yet and it just says sent. i know it has taken even months for someone to finally look over documents i sent in. so i just want to know do i need to actually call them to tell them about the changes, or just wait until someone views them? i just don’t want them to send my april benefits and then me have to pay them back since they haven’t viewed my job change/pay stubs yet."
"california- weird snap interview i was on snap last year. didn’t do my renewal so it stopped. redid the app and had my interview today 

between now and then i had a baby. i am not in contact with the father- long story short, i don’t know him. don’t judge me. my girlfriend (we live separately, finances are not combined) is on his birth certificate- which i haven’t ordered yet. i live with a roommate. we split rent and utilities. do not share food. one room each. 

well, during my interview the person asked me for my sons birth certificate and i told her i hadn’t ordered it. she said he would be disqualified then. i told her that was fine, he is only 7 months. she then asked about the father. i told her i didn’t know him. she then asked if he pays child support. i again told her i didn’t know him. she then told me i’m approved pending my sons birth certificate and income verification. 

i guess i’m confused. i’m fine with him not being included. i just need food for me. i told her i didn’t have it and she said i need to order it. 

is this standard? i’m not asking for him to be included in my “household”. i’m not looking for extra money for food. i also am not interested in going after the father for child support. he’s not even on the bc, someone else is. we will eventually do a second parent adoption. 

what are my options here? do i have to provide his bc? even if he’s disqualified? she wouldn’t explain much and was pretty accusatory."

"was approved, now discontinued? for ks

"phone interview with caseworker. (tn) i am scheduled for an interview for reapplication in march. i have received snap before but never missed an interview. how does the reapplication process actually work and will it be okay if i just miss this interview, let the benefits stop and reapply that way with different caseworker later on? 

firstly, i have anxiety. last time i spoke with this particular caseworker, she was quite condescending, judgmental and withheld a specific task that needed to be completed for my application to be approved, resulting in a my application being denied. i had to speak with another caseworker to actually process my application correctly. in addition to the information that i correctly submitted, she simply needed to call a family member to verify who was in my household (she did not tell me this. at all.) and in her own way, told me to get a job. i don’t want to go through that again. my first caseworker and the nice older man who got my application properly submitted were angels to me. i don’t know why this particular caseworker is like this but i would rather eat canned tuna and saltines for a couple of months than be interviewed by her again. i never missed an interview before so i don’t really know how that works which is why i’m asking if it’ll be okay if i do so. 

if this gets downvoted or ratio’ed by a comment, i don’t care. this is my actual situation and how i feel about it. 🤷‍♀️"

how do they take food stamps away? my family got ebt when the pandemic hit. i now got a new job and know i’ll make too much money. i should be starting soon but we still have money left on our card. do they zero out the card as soon as i start my new job? or do they just not replenish it?

i'm stuck on hold with the ebt number so thought i'd ask here to see if i get a faster, more straightforward answer

edit: finally got off hold. so if you're in the state of new york and head of household passes away, you do not need to re-apply.

"""expenses are greater than income"" ""please provide information as to how are you paying your bills"" the day i got out of the hospital from covid-19 where i developed pneumonia and almost died from it. i was reciving requests from snap well after a month that i had applied, but that i needed to verify some things. by the time i recovered at home to start looking up my bills and see if unemployment had payed me anything yet etc i saw their request in the mail. so i missed their deadline for 5 days.

now their original request said :

information/action required
expenses are greater than income. 
please provide information as to how you 
are paying your bills. 

acceptable verification/proof
you must provide verification of how you are meeting your expenses or proof your expenses are not paid

so i talked to a rep after that, i sent them my missed mortgage house payments, the mortgage is 1141 of the missed payments, but i wrote 1400 in ""shelter costs"" since i was including hoa.

that page says ""costs that lower your income"" (deductions) 
cost 1,400.     deduction. 586

they sent me a new letter saying:

expenses are greater than income.
please provide information as to how you are paying your bills. provide verification of your mortgage payment. 

what changed was the amount in their ""costs that lower your income""(deductions)

it says now, shelter 360, deduction 360.

so it seems like they adjusted my shelter costs and now they want to see how the remaining 360 are paid?
or they want to know how did i afford to pay stuff if my expenses were greater than income?

i thought of sending them the statement where it shows unemployment was paying in december but then they stopped in december, so i then applied to snap because i was unsure if i was going to get unemployment back.


what should i do and not do? i am having a very slow recovery from covid, i don't have the energy to be dealing with all the extra stress. i really need the help. unemployment has paid whenever they want to then stop paying again. 

i am not sure if what i posted make sense. i am just hoping to get advice from people that was in the same situation and how they resolved it. 


thank you. please don't let covid get you, it got me almost a year after i took care of myself."

i'm in los angeles county ca

i live in la county and i'm wondering when i can submit the recertification paperwork?

it says recertification due date 01/01/2023 but it doesn't give me the option to fill it out online. it's not a huge deal but i would just like to get it out of the way.

i started donating plasma and i get about $560 a month and i have about 1k saved up in the bank.  my rent is $625, and since i don't make enough through plasma donation i use a little bit of my savings to cover rent & my cell phone bill. so currently i am unemployed & i also live in a low income sober living.  do you think i'll still be eligible to receive ebt when i do my recertification? also, when putting in my plasma donation earnings do i put it under self employment? will my savings affect my eligibility at all? thanks to all that respond. i'm in los angeles county btw.

i've been getting the extra $95 on top of my usual $250 for awhile now. i'm curious, how do i find out if i'll receive it this month and on what day? i'm in california.

"how are calfresh snap benefits calculated? just got a letter saying my benefits are decreasing and the lady on the phone didn't help at all lol. even if you are below the income limit is it possible to receive less than the maximum amount? 

i get ssi, and i was getting $281.  i just got a letter saying as of 2/1/2023 my benefits are going to be lowered to $226.  

i just got off the phone with them because i was trying to get more information and the woman literally didn't know anything lol.  at first she says ""oh everyone got that letter it's just about the emergency allottment ending.""  then i was like well the letter says it is because of a change in my income, and she says ""oh that's what everyone's letter says."" and then i said ""well it doesn't add up to $95."" 

and finally she said oh well did your income change? i said my ssi went up from like $930 to $1250 due to changes to my housing and the cola.  

then she said ""oh ok that's the reason.""  

then i was like well can you look in the computer and tell me exactly what it was? and she looked and was like ""there is no recent note in here so i don't know."" 

then i try to ask ""well what income amount makes you eligible for the full $281?"" and she said ""oh i don't know we just put the numbers in the system, we don't give out that information.""   

so i am left still wondering whether or not my income increasing was the actual reason for the decrease. 

also, in march ssi plans to reduce my ssi amount by $120 a month, and i asked her if calfresh will update my amount automatically, and she said no, they only do it every 6 months i'd have to report it or something. she was very unclear. 

i have looked into it and i think that they have a standard deduction.  i also pay $850 a month in rent, can i get that deducted too? 

this reduction to my foodstamps along with the removal of the emergency allotment will seriously affect me. 

does anyone have any idea of the scale of income that they use? like what is it? 

like is it if you make $1,000 or less you get the full $281 calfresh. 

but if you make $1,100 you get $250 calfresh

and if you make $1,200 you get $220 calfresh

like that, does anyone know what the actual scale is??? the woman on the phone wouldn't tell me lol i'm so confused

thank you <3"
"first year college students apply for calfresh and basically got threatened by the caseworker santa clara county, ca

i and my brothers decided to move out of our parents' home for personal reason. we go to college in the same city where my parents live. we apply for calfresh and the caseworker continuously made remarks about we could have been lying about moving out since our parents' home is in the same city. we provided proof of income from unemployment, financial aid and also expenses such as rent; however, during the interview, she kept implying we are lying about moving out, and it is weird and unusual to not live with parents, asking about the dependency status on our parents' taxes, etc. she kept saying that i and my brother are so young, only freshmen in college, it would raise a question on the application and our case might get investigated. i am just baffled with the entire interview experience. 

so my question is: is our case really weird and special and worth investigating? does dependency on parent's tax affect our calfresh eligibility? do calfresh caseworker this hostile towards applicants?

i also put that i lived at my dorm when they asked for home address. i figured home address meant the address you lived at 90% of the time….so i probably got qualified because they thought i was independent (i’m not, i’m still dependent on my dads taxes and i live with him during summer).

needless to say i don’t think i actually qualify. what do i do? am i gonna have to pay all of this back? i live in michigan by the way. i’m also in college. they’ve given me so much in benefits i don’t even know what to do with it…i’m terrified right now. i can’t afford to pay almost $3,000 back. i’m a broke college student…"

"can a card stay active if your balance is $0 and your monthly benefits amount is $0? hope this question makes sense, i've been so confused by the process. so i lost my job and i applied for snap when my income was zero and got the maximum allotment of benefits i believe (i had no assets or dependents and wasn't receiving any other assistance if it matters).

about a week ago i finally found another job that pays a couple dollars above minimum wage. however, after plugging in my new information to https://fscalc.dhs.illinois.gov/fscalc/ i find that i pass the net monthly income test and asset test but i fail the gross monthly income test and my estimated ""potential monthly benefit amount""
 is $0

 i am submitting my change of information now, but i am wondering what that process looks like- is my card revoked/my account shut down because i make too much now? or will my card and account stay active with a $0 balance in case my income changes? like if i lose this job or my hours get cut. i am only barely making too much to be above the 130% poverty limit. if i made about $100 less per month i'd be below it. 

i'm really hoping the later in case something happens and i lose this job, so i won't have to go through the process again (it took me almost 3 weeks from applying to receiving my card, and a month before getting any funds iirc which is why it scares me).

sorry that was really long but hopefully someone can help me out."
"my father claims me as a dependent as it’s the only way i’m getting medi-cal. however my snap interview is on monday and i worry that will affect my eligibility? for context: i am moving in two weeks across the state to live on my own with roommates for college. i am heavily relying on this cal fresh to help me feed myself through this all. i have a monthly income of less than $2500, and a rent of $1,000. i do get financial aid although i don’t think cal fresh counts that as income. my parental contribution is $0 on financial aid documents which they wanted to see too. do you think they will still accept me?"

"california - if you ever received a calworks overpayment and calfresh overissuance in the same month you may be eligible to some relief counties have been processing calfresh over issuances incorrectly for years and now they have to fix things but only if you ask. 

if you were told you were overpaid calworks and calfresh for the same month, you can ask that your calfresh overissuance be recalculated.  

this may reduce the amount of calfresh benefits that you have to pay back.

"nj snap issues/questions i had snap benefits in atlantic county, nj. i moved to burlington county and was told that (despite my benefits being discontinued prior) that i had to have my still-active atlantic county case closed before i could apply in burlington county.

i contacted atlantic county, was never able to speak to an actual person, but left countless messages asking to have my call returned. it took them 5 months to call me back, for a five minute conversation asking my case to be closed, then another month for them to actually close it.

i applied to burlington, received the packet, sent it back and just got off the phone with them (called for status update) and was told that after receiving everything back it could take another few *months* to actually receive my card, benefits. i asked if there was any way to get expedited benefits, they said no.

i read on lsnjlaw
[https://www.lsnjlaw.org/government-aid-services/food-hunger-nutrition/food-stamps/pages/snap-nj-food-stamp-program.aspx]:

>if you qualify for food stamps/snap, you should get them no later than 30 days from the date the office got your application.

>if your household has little or no money and needs help right away, you may be eligible for expedited food stamps/snap. this means that the food stamp/snap office must give you food stamps/snap within seven days of the date you apply.

so - njlsw contradicts what i was told by bcss about how long it takes to receive benefits and the existence of expedited benefits.

just wondering if anyone has experienced applying (in burlington county or elsewhere with a similar situation) and if their experience reflected what i was told by bcss.

i'm freaking out - disabled, two kids, can't drive (so can't get to food pantries) and have been overdrafting my bank account every month just to buy food. i'm $500 in the negative with fees mounting daily and have no food. i'm really at the end of my rope.

any suggestions, information, etc would be greatly appreciated. thank you.

"gas station still hasn’t refund me my money $18 that they over charged me. | gas station clerk charged me 3 times and won’t refund me so just an update it’s been almost a whole month and they still haven’t given me my money back. ebt won’t help me so i need advice. i am debating between calling the police or running up in that store and taking $18 worth of merchandise. i won’t just let it go because they don’t deserve to keep my money . at this point, it’s not even about the money.. also, i want to say two weeks later i went back in the store and they said i have to keep waiting and 2 weeks after i called they said they were going to process the refund but still nothing. this was a district manager who said that . a refund doesn’t take a month they playing children games with the wrong one. then they want to look at me like i’m crazy like if i’m making a big deal and not once have they apologize to me for a mistake they made . with this inflation damn straight i’m counting every dollar.

in total he charged me $18 and when i called ebt customer service they said i have to take it up with the merchant but the merchant told me they voided it so i’m gonna get those funds back. with ebt a cancelled charge immediately gets back on the card. and it’s been 5 days. i know it sounds dramatic and it’s only $18 but you know no one can walk into a store and get $18 of free items. but anyway i feel like calling the cops. any advice? i’m in florida"
"income limits, deductions, and cut off firstly, apologies if this is already answered somewhere in the sub. i did a cursory search and was unable to find a clear answer. 

my family of 3 (mom, dad, child under 6) qualified for calfresh and medi-cal after my husband lost his job, which was our sole income. we live in ca in an extremely high cost of living area. 

i started looking for work as soon as he lost his job. i'm close to accepting a job with a top research institution that would have pretty horrible pay, but strategically could be a good career move in the long run. if i'm grossing $3,582.40 to $3,960 a month would my family of three (husband, child, and myself) lose benefits? i think i read that there is a shelter/utilities deduction. after utilities we pay about $2,200 a month in rent. believe it or not this is about market rate rent where i live for the size of our rental unit. i anticipate take home pay will be about 30% less after healthcare and taxes. 

if we still have benefits, would the amount granted decrease? is there a calculator to figure this out? i want to take the job, but i don't want to lose benefits until my husband is working too and we don't need to worry about barely making rent and not eating."

"snap lowered again even though living expenses increased [nd] i have contacted the local office via email but in the past they've explained nothing to me even in person so i have low expectations if they do get around to getting back to me.

i moved in feb. my rent costs went up. my other expenses are the same but reported as usual. i reported all changes. i have gotten another letter that my new benefit amount will only be 29$ instead. surely this isn't correct? how am i getting less in snap when my expenses increased? is there something i'm not factoring in correctly?

i'm applying for food stamps and they want my bank savings account amount. i still have around 3k saved from april when i deposited my federal return.

will my federal income tax return effect eligibility?should i give them a transaction history of 5 months to show the only money in my bank account is from income tax and shouldn't be counted as a resource until october 24th?

applied on 11/14 and my state is waiving interviews. i reapplied on 11/14 and florida is waiving interviews for snap. i mailed in my husbands paystubs to the main mailing address and i havent heard anything back. my application on the dcf website is still pending and there’s no verifications or notices mailed. what’s the next step? when we go to the local office they are very rude and they don’t assist.
"parents’ food stamps rejected, mom is ending work next year- can we reapply? my dad has been retired for a while because of cancer and leg pains but somehow keeps getting denied disability whenever we tried so we stopped trying. they rely on food stamps and medicaid/medicare. my mom just reached retirement age and went on retirement as well. but my parents’ combined retirement income is just too little to survive plus the factory my mom works at had trouble hiring and asked my mom to stay to the end of the year. she thought this will help with money but it ended up hurting. 

we got the recertification letter in august and recertified. their income is too high by the smallest margin and they were denied. we live in nyc and everything is out of control expensive. 

my question is - is there anything else they can do? working disqualifies them but not working is not enough either. come january, my mom will stop working - can we immediately reapply for food stamps then? will this denial of food stamps affect their medicare/medicaid? my dad has very frequent doctor visits for his cancer (remission) follow up so they can’t lose medical. my mom also has a host of health issues and need that medical care as well. 

thanks for any advice!"
"school loans counted as income? | no call for interview? hi,

i am in ca and in the process of renewing my benefits. when i applied last year i said i was in school (plus 2 kids) and received my private loans. they didn't request any other document but for the renewal they said this has to be counted.  does anyone know how this works?

thank you!

hi, i received a letter a few weeks ago that my recertification is due 8/31/23. it also stated that i had a phone interview for this same thing this morning at 8:30 am i did submit my recertification online within a few days. when i look on my online portal it does say my interview was scheduled for this morning and when i click on my case details it shows this:

"expungement notice says $40 left, grocery receipt says $360 left… is that money ok to spend? asking for my girlfriend, who moved last fall from massachusetts to california. she closed her ma case and stopped using the card, and opened up a new case in ca (there was no overlap between the request to end benefits in ma and to start benefits in ca, not sure if that matters.)

last month she received an expungement notice from ma stating that she has until 5/28 to spend the remaining ~$40 on her card. she went to the grocery store yesterday and bought $39.xx worth of groceries with the ma card, but the receipt lists a remaining ebt balance of ~$360. i thought at first it might be combining her ma and ca balances, but we checked and her ca balance is ~$260.

can she spend the remaining $360? or is she beholden to the amount listed in the expungement notice?"

"can i use ca food stamps out of state? | when should i cancel my ebt? i moved the washington this month. i didn't turn in the sar 7 and thus received a letter stating that after december 31st they will be stopping my food stamps. no big deal, i will be living and working in wa soon and hopefully won't need them. however i still have some leftover food stamps and as far as i know i can still use those but won't be receiving any more.....which is what i thought until i got another load of food stamps on january 8th?? they told me they were stopping my food stamps after december but gave me more in january?

so basically, am i allowed to use up the rest of my food stamps in this state since i (supposedly)won't be getting any more? do i have to contact the office and tell them i'm traveling in case they flag me for fraud?(i plan on using it all up within 30 days). and am i allowed to use this extra they gave me or is that a mistake on their end? or...am i just confused and dumb lol.

i am in san bernardino county for more context. also i am crashing on my sisters couch for the time being until i find myself an apartment with an official address. so as of right now i'm still a ca resident

i received the sar 7 today, and it's due in about 2 days or so. i know it's necessary to report if i want to keep ebt but i'm moving on the 21st of january to another state. should i just report that i want to cancel the ebt? if so, does that mean that the remaining balance on the card, that i was saving for when we run out of groceries in the middle of the month will be taken back? i work and get about $600 a month. my bf just got a seasonal job as well and is planning on quitting in jan before we leave so i already know that that might affect the ebt amount anyways. i just wanna know if i get to keep the $200+ that's on my card for this month and then just get nothing for january as we won't really need it."

"public health emergency & food stamps | college student - pandemic exemption | [oh] college student — work study hi all,

the public health emergency has covered me for food stamps as i am a college student with an efc of 0 & qualify for work study.

i understand that i am only covered as long as the phe is active on a federal level. it expires today.

does anyone know if there are plans to extend the phe again, and if not, if i should reach out to my food stamp office to make sure my file is updated so i don’t mistakenly keep receiving benefits?

thank you!

eta: i am in ohio, but i’m not sure if this matters due to the federal policy which makes me eligible.

hi all,

starting in january 2021, there was federal legislation that expanded snap benefits to college students during the public health emergency. it made students who were eligible for work study and who had an expected family contribution (efc) of 0 eligible to receive food stamps.

i applied back in may and was approved. i'm currently a non-ohio resident going to school in ohio for graduate school, i was approved for work study, and have an efc of 0 due to being a grad student.

however, i've had some recent worries about my eligibility. i uploaded all the documents required, such as my bank account, my personal ids, information about my car and rent payments, student loans, roommate information, so on and so forth. i had a phone interview where they asked me a few questions and then approved me.

i've found some inconsistent information about asset testing-- i found the federal limits for assets regarding bank accounts and assets such as cars, and those financial limits, which i am above. however, i believe i've found information that states ohio doesn't do asset testing when considering eligibility for food stamps, but nothing concrete. i did find information about income levels, which i am well below as i was unemployed, and i am currently earning \~$400/month from work study (which is not counted as regular income, i believe).

essentially, i'm worried that i was approved mistakenly because of this special exception, and that it will be found and i'll have to pay the money back. as a grad student, you can imagine that i don't really have much excess money to do so. if anyone who is more familiar with the snap program could address my concerns, i would be incredibly grateful.

tldr: ohio grad student who is a non-resident of ohio approved for food stamps, income level is well below poverty line but has assets above the federal limit. not sure if my residency status or assets disqualify me and i was misapproved and will owe money back.

thank you!

hi all,

i am a grad student who has been receiving food stamps since may 2021 under the current pandemic exemption. i’m a bit of an anxious person and constantly worry about that something will go wrong and i’ll have to pay back food stamp money. i have a couple questions—

1) i started a work study job in september 2021 where i earn $400/month in work study money. would i need to report this or is it not considered income because it is work study?

2) my parents help me with rent most months, but they never asked me about this during my intake interview. should i note this somewhere? would it change the amount i receive?

thanks!"
"ohio snap ebt card lock feature is now live if you live in the state of oh and receive snap via ebt, the state has rolled out the first of several anti-fraud measures planned for the near future. you do have to have the connectebt mobile app for this feature currently. 

""snap card lock

 for your awareness:

to assist ohioans in securing their snap benefits, a new card lock feature became available july 1, 2023 in the connectebt mobile app. the card lock feature allows the cardholder to lock their card when not in use. cardholder should consider setting their card to a locked status until they are actively making a purchase with the ebt card.   once the purchase is successful the cardholder can then lock their card again using the connectebt mobile app."""

"my application is in washington dc for some reason, but i live in indiana. what is going on???? my grandmother (legal adult guardian) helped me apply for food stamps a while ago (back in november i think) and i was instantly approved for around $300 to $350, and we did all the proper step of calling them that weekend to get that month's balance and have the card sent to me, but they never gave us the balance, and they never sent me the card. when my grandma called to inquire, they just said it was ""processing"".

a while later, i recieved a letter saying i needed proof of something related to ssi/disability, which at that point, we had gotten a lawyer to help us fight that whole mess, since i'd been denied 4 times at that point. i don't know what grandma did about that.

since then, grandma's called every so often, and has just gotten the same answer of ""processing"".

less than 30 minutes ago, she was talking to my behaviorist, and she said something along the lines of ""they said it was in washington dc.""

washington dc is around 500 miles from where i live. it makes no sense for my application to be there.

i just wanna know what's going on, since i'm living off of $60 to $100 of child support back-pay a month, and can't buy my own groceries to learn how to cook thanks to that, since for some reason, 1 meal bought at walmart containing the cheapest brands costs $20 to $30."

"just approved for calfresh - i have some questions about using the ebt card... i just got approved for calfresh (california version of snap) and am now waiting on my ebt card in the mail.  i have a few questions... they seem really dumb and obvious, but i've been searching around the calfresh site and the wiki here and am finding no answers.  forgive me if they're common questions, maybe my search-engine skills are especially bad today.

1. i know i can only buy food and even then there are restrictions (no eaten-in-the-store type foods, etc.) and the person doing my interview said ""it just won't work if you try to buy toilet paper or something with it.""  ok.  what happens at the check-out of the grocery store if i accidentally have an item that isn't covered?  does the whole payment get rejected and i have to use an alternative payment for everything?  or does it notify the check-out person that the amount of the non-food item has to be paid for another way while putting the allowed items on the ebt?  something else?

2.  similar to the last question... if i'm close to using up my monthly balance, and accidentally get a few items that put me over that balance, does it reject the whole thing, or inform me and the checkout person that i have to pay for the rest with another method?  something else?

3. i'm guessing the answer to this must be yes, but does the check-out person at the grocery store see that i'm paying with calfresh/foodstamps?  i kind of know some of the checkout people at the store i usually go to and i know it shouldn't matter, but i'd rather they didn't know i am on foodstamps. 

4. i'm guessing the answer to this must be no, but if i don't use a lot of my balance one month, does any of that remaining amount ""roll over"" to the next month?  i assume it entirely resets to the given balance each month, i'd be very surprised if it were anything else, but i'd like to know for sure.

"question- sd county ca- new immigrant applies for benefit hi, is anyone familiar with how the i-864 affidavit of support and sponsor deeming working towards snap/cal fresh? i tried to search for so long and didn't get an answer. i am specifically looking at adding a new family member with a long-term permanent resident card to join the same household calfresh program. 

i found out that some said the sponsor needs to repay for any means-tested programs in 5yrs and certain sites said the california agencies have not sought reimbursement from sponsors. (state funded perhaps?) and i mean there's no way to apply for it if the benefit needs to pay back since i am just looking for some extra help because of the higher food costs.  any suggestions might be helpful since i couldn't think of any other things besides rent and wage to increase the irt at this moment. 

thank you in advance to spend time looking at and answering my questions."
"oregon snap website down? hey friends! i need to reapply for my food stamps very soon, but when i try to access the website, it gives me and error 404 message. is anyone else's oregon snap page down for them?"
"food stamp interview months away? (or) hey there, i've been getting snap for exactly a year and we submitted the recertification earlier this month. i got a call today saying they want to do a phone interview... in may. excuse me? i'm so confused. does this mean we won't get benefits until the interview? they said we could call to do it earlier. is that our only hope? there was no information about anything else. no indication that we filled anything out wrong, just a notice of an interview.

thanks for any insight."

"would a 1-time payment of $300 affect my benefits? (arkansas) i’m worried about not only snap but also medicaid, not sure which sub would be best to ask this question.

i’m on ssdi and get extra help from the state with paying my medicare premium, copays, prescriptions. and i also have snap.

i got an offer to open a bank account and receive a $300 bonus. i’m already really worried about the public health emergency ending and dhs is a mess so it’s just a waiting game to know if i’ll be affected. but this $300 offer is expiring soon and i plan to use the bonus $ for a necessity. 

this is a little bit of a hassle already and feeling overwhelmed, but it would be so nice to have this money for something i absolutely need. 

i’m having trouble figuring out if it’s a wise decision though."
"texas-26 year old married full time student + full time worker looking to apply. feel like i won’t get accepted. advice needed! hello! i’m a 26 year old full time online college student. i currently have a pell grant plus subsidized loans. i was accepted into the acp program and get $30 off of my wifi bill per month. i make $20 an hour, but i am married and my spouse makes $12.50 an hour. she is full time online college as well. we pay rent for a single family home. both full time jobs. should i even attempt to apply for food stamps or will i get denied because we make “too much”? we are basically paycheck to paycheck due to rent and bills. rent is $1650 a month. if i do apply, should i do so online or over the phone? thanks!"
"using the balance of my calfresh benefits after a move to michigan i currently have over $600 in calfresh benedits on my ebt card. i’m a live-alone senior, and i take advantage to food banks, sales, dollar stores, etc. because my benefits pre--covid were $20 a month.  i was preparing for the post-covid reduction.

strangely enough, my first love from when i was 15 y/o called me a month ago.  we had never forgotten each other, and his wife of 40 years died a year ago.  we reconnected, and i am moving to michigan.

we’ll be living together, and our incomes will make us ineligible for snap.  ineligibility will be as of august 1.  will i still get the pandemic allotment for july, paid in august?can i continue to use my old benefit balance after the move, using them in mi?  will they expire at some point?"
"got a random 281 deposit on my card didn't even know it was there till i randomly checked. what's going on. my eligibility worker mailed me a letter it said $23 a month so i'm confused. | so they really wanted me to come in for $23 a month ebt | what to do? my benefits portal doesn't say when the deposit was made just shows the last transaction i made with the $23 allotment i got. i didn't make it to my face to face interview with my case worker and didn't get an email about the deposit coming .

edit to add.. i'm in southern california my county is los angeles. thank you

so california more specifically la county wanted me to come in yesterday morning for a face to face over my gasp ebt stamps. really they expected less when i wasn't working and getting the full amount here for abwod case. all was over the phone . not only that the eligibility worker over the phone got all confused about my december pay stubs and tried getting snippy with me till she finally saw what everything meant . my thing is i wasn't expecting the full allotment but how do i only qualify for 23 bucks in california 🤔. i'm pretty sure she calculated wrong

hello so i've been on mloa (medical leave) from work the past few weeks and applied for short term disability but it's still processing . is there a way to increase my benefits temporarily? my recertification is in may i think . this is emergency wondering if should just start new case . i'm in la county(pasadena)  california. i currently have no income coming in ."

"state of emergency question hey everyone, i need a little guidance on how to go about this situation. i am currently a senior in college in nc. i have been receiving food stamps since my sophomore year because i was participating in work study. in october, i had to do my recertification and assumed i would be approved because i was still eligible for work study- even though i was not actively participating. i was told by my caseworker that i was an ineligible student because i was not actively participating in work study. after reading through this subreddit i decided to request a hearing. after my hearing, the decision was upheld because nc state of emergency for covid-19 was lifted in august 2022. was this decision correct? or should they be abiding by the federal public health emergency for covid-19 (which ends january 11). i appreciate any advice or help!

update: my case was reviewed by the chief hearing officer and he reversed the decision! he said they are going based off of the federal public health emergency and not the state’s, so i am eligible for food stamps. whoever delete their comment thank you so much again, you’re the reason i decided to request another hearing!"
recently turned 22 basically turned 22. was on my parents food stamps before. i was told i could apply for my own food stamps when i turned 22 but wanted to verify. i currently live in pittsburgh and will be moving to texas in a few months for college. i just wanted to know if should apply here for 3 (months) duration i am staying then move to texas (staying for 9 months) and still be on food stamps through pa or would i have to reapply in texas.

hi,
i submitted my recertification online on 8/7.
the due date is on 8/31.
is there a reason why it's taking a while for the case worker to look into my file? does it usually take more than a week? should i wait? maybe there’s a delay? it’s my first time renewing, so please help!

i’m a college student and i am currently on summer break. my school is at a different city compared to where my parents live. i moved out of my dorm and  will be staying at my parents house temporarily for 2 1/2 months. i received a mail that i need to complete the recertification. since i no longer have access to my previous dorm mail, am i supposed to change it to my parents address to receive mail and then change it back to my new dorm address in september? if i do, my concern is that the county that i’m enrolled in for ebt is different county where my parent lives. will that be okay? btw i live in california. please help!"

"ny, does the balance expire after 9 months if not on benefits? i was receiving food stamps along with my parents last year for a few months. i started another job in the summer, so by july we were off the food stamps. we have not been on food stamps since then. we just got numerous letters in the mail saying the balance will be expunged by march. we had not realized there is a few thousand on the balance from pandemic relief stuff(the original amount we were getting was very small). if we make the account active again, will this save what's on the balance, or will that 9 month limit count down because we don't receive food stamps anymore?

any clarity on this is appreciated, thank you."
"advice on when to apply? hiya! i'm looking into applying for snap in ma soon. currently my partner and i are living with family but getting ready to move into our own place again in sept. he's unemployed,  imm currently employed part time, though my work only schedules me one day a week rn -_- when we move we'll both be looking for part time service work to get started (new place is about 45 min away and with only one car commuting before moving for work would be hard) 

when do you think would be a good time for us to apply? i was going to apply right when we move but maybe waiting until we're employed more stably would be better? i've never done this before but have been looking into it for almost a year now (we've been in various stages of unhoused/couch surfing etc since january so i keep psyching myself out of applying bc our situation changed every other month.) but stability is in sight so i wanted to finally ask for advice! 

thanks! any advice is appreciated!"
i’m self employed and got form in mail to recertify. i’ve been receiving fs for 4 months. i uploaded required paperwork and got a call today. last month my bills exceeded my income and they asked how i paid bills when income was not enough.  i told them i had to use a credit card. they have requested now my credit card statement plus a copy of the front and back of my credit card. i feel uncomfortable giving my credit card information.

"moved out of state hey everyone.

my grandmother moved out of state, down here to south carolina about a year and a half ago. she lived with me until getting her own house and address a few weeks ago.


she has been issued food stamps for a really long time. and after moving down here, she didn't have her old benefits cancelled. 


she has been receiving her food stamps from ohio since she moved down here.


we haven't used them in fear of getting in trouble.


is she safe to use them? she will be calling and trying to get them transferred down here soon."

"insanity so, i want you all to hear the insanity i just had to deal with. i have yet to receive any benefits for july. today i finally got through to someone (my county (essex county in new jersey) has switched to a digital format so talking to people is even harder) i was told that i have not received benefits for july because i needed to be recertified for july. you know when i got the paperwork for recert? 2 days before july! and that was because of an error with the mail where they were returned as undeliverable and needed to be resent. i was told it can take up to a month to process. so, in otherwards, i may not get benefits for july because it can take up to the start of august to process the papers for recert. would it not make sense, if a person needs to recert for july, and it can take up to a month to process, to send said paperwork in may, so that it has all of june to process and then someone is not sitting on their ass worried how they are going to eat for a month?"

however i read the paper work saying that you can  ask your caseworker to reverse the expungement. does that mean i have to go into the ebt center to talk to someone in person ? can i not due this over the phone?"

"virginia just increased the income limit and eliminated the asset limit for snap through bbce | reasons for underredemption of snap benefits | gross income limit for households with elderly/disabled members | keeping non-resident college students on snap case virginia passed a new law into effect july 1st, 2021 to implement [broad-based categorical eligibility (bbce)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/broad-based-categorical-eligibility) for snap. the virginia bbce policy increases the snap gross income limit to 200% fpl and eliminates the asset limit. this change is estimated to unlock snap benefits for an additional 25,000 households in virginia.

if you happen to have applied in virginia previously and been denied due to assets or income, i would encourage you to apply again!

first, happy world gratitude day - i am very thankful for this community!   


i am looking for information on reasons for underredemption of snap benefits. i found [this analysis](https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/snapebt-benefitredemption-summary.pdf) of benefit redemption patterns from the federal food and nutrition service, but have not been able to locate any qualitative research on reasons for underredemption (e.g., fear of overpayment). does anyone know of any studies (formal or informal)?  


if not, i would also welcome any insights from personal experience or anecdotes to inform a potential study on this topic.

hello, i'm hoping some eligibility workers or policy specialists can help me better understand a pretty specific aspect of snap income eligibility. as far as i know, it is a federal standard that applies to every state that a household that includes an elderly or disabled household member only needs to meet the net income eligibility standard (not the gross income standard). but in many states ([tn](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/human-services/documents/snap%20tn.gov_income_update.pdf), [il](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=30357) for example) the income tables that are displayed on the snap pages of agency websites include a separate gross income standard for elderly or disabled households. 

is there a reason why states display a gross income standard for those households even though it doesn't apply to them? am i missing something?

thank you in advance for sharing your knowledge!

hello, i have been getting a lot of questions about college student snap eligibility and one thing that came up is whether college students who move on campus can remain on their family snap case. my gut answer is no because they are no longer living with them (seems obvious re: definition of snap household), but i was listening to a webinar where a representative ([see timestamp 27:30](https://youtu.be/viebd-qeyzi?t=1646)) seemed to indicate that moving on campus could be considered a temporary change of living situation which could mean that a college student may remain on their family snap case.   


i don't have a specific state in mind as my org works across states. thank you for any insight! i don't want to be sharing incorrect information."

"can you tell me if my mother qualifies? my mother is 56 and chose early retirement (retiring in 10 years) because of neck pain and her job was strenuous. she was a stay at home mom most of our lives before divorce, and didn't fight my father for half of anything (or child support/alimony). she moved in with me about 6 months so ago so that i can care for her financially in exchange for doing some light work at my business. my brother is also 21 and in college, and slightly depressed, so he does college online and doesn't leave the house. he does receive full financial aid and pays me $200 in rent. i am supporting both of them (food and whatever other household items). my mother only receives $600 a month in retirement money and $200 a month goes to her health insurance. she will get ss eventually (i don't know how much it will be, and if it will be 62 or 65?). she didn't feel like going through the hassle of applying for disability instead, so she elected retirement. i also have a much less laborious job for her doing light reception work at my business, so it works out for me and it is not as strenuous as her job as a custodian. i make a decent amount, but food costs are getting so high and i'm trying to save for a house (we are sharing a 1br apt right now). in a situation like this, would her or my brother qualify for food stamps to take some of the burden off of me financially?"

>""that timely processing rate, considered a “critical indicator” of agency performance in the [annual mayor’s management report](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/mmr2022/hra.pdf), has plummeted **from about 92 percent** in fiscal year 2021 to just over 60 percent last year **to now 46.3 percent**, officials said.""

i have noticed that in /r/scams, people make clear that scammers might try to private message you after you post about getting scammed.

i’m not sure if that might happen here, but i wanted to post this as a public service announcement.

do not engage with accounts messaging you asking for personal info and saying they can get your benefits back.

(also, if you have received such a private message, please reply to let us know.)

today is my cake day, and so as a participant and mod i wanted to give a big **thank you** to everyone who participates here helping each other out with an incredibly complex, often under-resourced program which helps so many people. we're just shy of **10,000 members**, which makes me very happy to see.

i know how many redditors here also respond to questions on top of many day-job hours and life struggles of their own.

i also have a cake day request: we post and reply here helping each other with really hard and often negative stuff. but **i'd love to hear a positive story or two** from your experiences; if a staff member has gone above and beyond, if ebt has really helped, that kind of thing.

i know that may be a strange request! but i think with things being so hard sometimes, it helps to share the positive stuff we've seen. (also it's my cake day! ;p)

thanks again everyone. i appreciate you!

i recently learned that the ebt system used by many states now supports a person choosing to block *out of state* and/or *online* purchases with their ebt card.

with recent ""card skimming"" thieves draining benefits, this may be an option folks want to consider if they don't travel out of state and/or make purchases online.

this option is available in states that have ""ebtedge"", and can be done by:

1. logging into the state's ebt portal
2. clicking ""protect my account""
3. selecting the option to turn off out-of-state and/or internet transactions

i have found specific info that this option is available at least in ca, or, and fl, but i believe applies to any state that uses ebtedge (fis) as their ebt platform.

arkansas now has a web form for questions that you can use instead of calling the call center, called access anywhere: [https://humanservices.arkansas.gov/divisions-shared-services/county-operations/access-anywhere/](https://humanservices.arkansas.gov/divisions-shared-services/county-operations/access-anywhere/)

statement here: [https://www.fns.usda.gov/news-item/fns-007.23](https://www.fns.usda.gov/news-item/fns-007.23) 

this page a lot more substantive info: [https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/stolen-benefits](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/stolen-benefits) 

***tldr: all states have submitted plans for stolen benefit replacement, and this page (*** [***https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals***](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals) ***) will be updated as state plans are approved with implementation dates.***

some key points:

* **february 2023:** by law, state agencies were required to submit their state plan \[for replacing stolen benefits\] to fns by feb. 27, 2023.
* **march 2023 and forward:** fns is reviewing and approving state plans for implementation. we have [compiled a list](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/replacing-stolen-benefits-state-plan-approvals) of approved state plans and estimated implementation dates. state plans will remain in effect until new fns regulations on benefit replacements, issued under this new authority, take effect.

**tips for snap participants:**

* **avoid simple pins**. number combinations such as 1111, 1234 or 9876 may be easy for others to guess.
* **keep your pin and card number secret**. do not share your pin or card number with anyone outside your household. cover the keypad when you enter your pin on a machine.
* **beware of phishing**. state agencies and ebt processors will never call or text to ask for your pin or card number.
* **change your pin often**. change your pin at least once a month, right before your benefit issuance date.
* **check your ebt account regularly for unauthorized charges**. if you see any, change your pin right away to stop the thief from making new purchases. report suspicious activity to your [local snap office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).
* **contact your local snap office**. if you think you are the victim of card skimming and your snap benefits were stolen, contact your [local snap office](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory).

sharing for information and discussion, since everyone here lives and breathes this.

today, president biden signed [an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/) on customer experience and service delivery with a lot of focus on benefits.

on food stamps it specifically says:

>   (d)  the secretary of agriculture shall:  
...  
            (ii)   **identify opportunities to reduce individuals’ and families’ burdens by simplifying enrollment and recertification for nutrition assistance programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap)**

so i'm curious — for you, what are the opportunities you see to...

* reduce burdens
* simplify enrollment and recertification

hi all, just wanted to do a quick post because i think a lot of people probably have this question today.

has anyone used this?

i'm mentioning this because for anyone who is at higher risk for coronavirus, doing the ordering online and just going in to swipe the card and grab the bag may be useful.

first a huge thank you to all eligibility staff and case workers on here who take the time to help people struggling with the process.  


this may be a bit of an out-there question, but i've spent the last 5 years working to make the process of applying for and keeping snap benefits easier for clients, and i'm curious about your experiences with this.  


from your experience:

  
\- what parts of the process are most difficult for clients? what leads otherwise eligible applicants to not make it through?  


\- what changes in your state, county, or office have made the process better for your clients in your experience? (for example policy changes, training, it systems, business process changes, lobby improivements)

i've been seeing some megathreads elsewhere around benefits like unemployment, and i'm wondering if we should marshal the collective knowledge here across our various states to give a really good overview of how people can go about applying and getting enrolled given everything (especially as call centers are or are soon to be slammed.)

what do you all think?

hi everyone!

i wanted to share an announcement that as of today, online services for los angeles county (california) have moved from the yourbenefitsnow web site to the newer [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) web site.

this includes stuff like:

* applying for benefits
* checking existing case information
* uploading documents

[benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) has been in use for a number of months now in the counties that used to use the c4yourself system. over the next couple of years, all the rest of california will move onto [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com).

if you live in la county and experience any problems, please post below, and folks can share answers and/or give a way to report the problem.

i'm wondering if anyone knows if eligibility workers in some states can view individual ebt transactions. i heard this second-hand, and i do not believe it is the case in my state, but wondering if it is the case elsewhere."
"father of child is moving out of my household, he won’t change his information. im trying to apply for benefits. (fl)i haven’t been able to get a hold of him. he’s going no contact. im trying to apply for benefits but his information is basically all connected with my address. his low income job, his mail, his license, everything. i’m trying to figure out if theres a way i can legally make him change that information.

i want to apply to benefits for the first time since i have a newborn. i earn way below income. not enough for us. i’ve considered moving somewhere else because the father of my child hasn’t changed his address/information yet and i don’t want to raise an investigation and get in trouble and have them think he’s here. moving seems like such a hassle. i’m currently living alone but what other way is there to prove that it’s just me and my child here?"
"mandatory household member question | fyi - p-ebt changes re: homeschool / virtual school students | snap and 18-21 year old not in parents household? | potential gov shutdown & snap questions | semi-related question re medicaid | ebt down - tx {and other states} | moving questions | tx shorted benefits | 2023 snap updates | amazon snap promo | psa: hold onto your p-ebt card if you received one | walmart's at it again | usda news on online snap & a sneak peak of the future | fyi some states are changing rules | any updates as to the status of grocery delivery and snap? | can someone weigh in on what this means? usda article about increases | usda snap & college students news release | odd payment issue with snap & amazon | am i just going to be out of luck? moving & snap delay | how far behind is texas running? | texas snap / power outage? | the new child tax credit payments & assistance programs? | just curious - corona virus and snap asking for a relative of mine. they may be having an unrelated person move in with them due to some recent law changes. they are in michigan. 

said person is 18 - would they fall under the mandatory household member due to being under 22, even though they are unrelated to those on the snap case? 

they probably won't have all the proper documents for snap either - their biological parent is refusing to give them their birth certificate and social security card. it's a complicated situation that i don't think i can really explain here due to the politics rule. is there some type of guidance for this situation? i'm told it may take several months to get replacement documents - would they be ineligible in the interim?

fyi, there has been a recent change in p-ebt requirements starting for the 2022-23 school year p-ebt and states are now required to cover eligible children who attended homeschools / virtual schools **due to concerns with covid**. states were given the option to apply it to summer 22 p-ebt as well, but i'm not aware of any who have yet. i know there are several other homeschooling parents who frequent here that this will impact. workers, be aware homeschooled parents may or may not be aware of eligibility for p-ebt going forward. i'm sure it will be both a headache and a blessing for many. 

&#x200b;

if it's okay with the mods, i'll keep this thread updated with approvals for 22-23 and their homeschool section of the plans if anyone asks for their state. if anyone wants me to check the summer p-ebt in their state to see if they retro-actively are covering homeschooled kids, please let me know the state and i'll see what i can find out. 

&#x200b;

so far, only wisconsin has been approved for school year 22-23 p-ebt but states are just starting to be approved.

asking because of another question here made me wonder. i'm moving to mi this fall from tx, but we're adding another household member as my bonus child {18} will be moving in with us due to family issues. i am not in any way biologically or legally related to them - i just raised the divorced neighbor's kids because it was a neglect situation on both sides. 

how does that work for snap? is the state of mi going to go after their biological parent for child support on someone of legal maturity age? do they need to go on my case regardless because i'm in a parental role in the household?

i was going to have them open a case independently from us because we won't be preparing meals in common typically {we have multiple food allergies, they have different tastes} and because the idea is to teach them self-sufficiency and life skills with the goal of them moving out on their own in 6-12 months after getting a ged and employment. 

is that the best way to do things? and while i know this is the snap forum, does anyone know about medicaid for the same kid? they have insurance from dad, but there are no covered physicians in mi as the policy is out of tx. i assume medicaid would be secondary, of course. 

a few questions i can't seem to find an answer to elsewhere. i know that if the gov defaults  / shuts down, nothing really happens for 30 days as far as benefits, etc. after 30 days it gets hazy though. 

my question is at what point would ebt cards temporarily stop working, if any? i have a balance on my card because i'm using up stuff to move but our move has been slightly delayed into late summer. if the gov defaults & shuts down i'm okay because of the banked benefits but at what point would i start to risk losing access due to things?

i apologize in advance. this forum is far more active than the medicaid one, and i figured workers might know. state would be mi. 

unusual situation and i cannot find policy online to answer. a friend, lets call them e, is 18. they are currently covered on parental insurance out of tx {home state} and will be until 26. they are moving to mi and will be living independently without family support. there are areas of care that are expressly not covered on the tx policy due to tx laws being passed presently for anyone who conducts business with the state {parent is a state employee}. mi medicaid covers those areas of care. 

&#x200b;

would they be able to get medicaid as a secondary to cover things the tx policy thru parent will not? or would they be denied completely due to having ""full coverage""? how would that work exactly?

looks like ebt is down in tx and possibly other states as well. walmart app will not bring up pinpad & i""m seeing reports online of the same with other stores.

we're moving this summer, going tx to mi. couple of questions as far as snap & move

1. when exactly do i need to report the move? we're moving over the span of several weeks with multiple trips back and forth. do i wait until i am 100% completely out of texas after the final trip to notify them of the move within 10 days? or do the 10 days start as soon as i begin the move?
2. part 2 of above - what's the fastest way to get them to end my tx case once i am completely out of tx so i can reapply in mi? i'm worried as it took several months for a change report recently - are move reports prioritized? 
3. during the move, i'll be running two households for close to a month or so. if i only order delivery from walmart / amazon, will it tell snap the delivery address is not in tx on some orders? i typically order delivery only anyway. can they see the address where things are delivered?

so i've been waiting since october for the mess with my shorted benefits to get sorted out {never got 2023 increase}. change report was submitted in october, i've escalated, etc - tried the ombudsman but that just got bounced back to dhs . my renewal came due and i figured i'd bring it up with the worker because nothing else has worked. 

well...it looks like they renewed without interviewing. which is fine and i knew it might be a possibility. but the change report from october now says ""reviewed"". does that mean they've fixed it? i only appear to have my april snap benefits {now correct amount}. would the shorted benefits come at a later date? 

there's no approval letter or anything in my online account yet either, so i'm guessing it's still in the works but likely delayed by the holiday.

[https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fy-2023-cola#:\~:text=the%20resource%20limit%20for%20households,increase%20by%20%24500%20to%20%244%2c250](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fy-2023-cola#:~:text=the%20resource%20limit%20for%20households,increase%20by%20%24500%20to%20%244%2c250).

wanted to share. got this in my mail today. ""customers with a registered snap ebt card get $10 off of $35 on amazon fresh. promo code: snapoff10""

expires 4/15/21

it's very likely, depending on state, that there will be a fall issuance of p-ebt funds for kids either distance learning or if schools close. i'm hearing local and state level talk of it here in texas. i'm guessing other states are similar.

they're making snap eligible items snap ineligible in the system again fyi. so far it's sam's cola both regular & diet of most flavors as well as a lot of drink mixes. 

double check your stuff & if your receipt totals seem off that's probably why. i'm in texas, but folks are complaining on their facebook from other states as well so it appears to be company wide.

[https://www.fns.usda.gov/news-item/fns-0008.22](https://www.fns.usda.gov/news-item/fns-0008.22)

in a nutshell summed up - grants for smaller companies / retailers to help bring them on board with online snap. i really really hope this goes on to include things like csa's / online ordering from local vendors. 

but they also offer this tantalizing clue - 

>usda is currently developing a [pilot program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/mobile-payment-pilot) to allow snap consumers to use their phones to purchase groceries at the checkout counter and will soon seek states to participate in this pilot.

&#x200b;

so it sounds like the ability to use snap via a saved card with things like scan & go without having the physical card present to swipe. i'm not sure how i feel about this - on one hand it seems like it would free up a lot of time in store for a lot of folks via the use of scan & go to see as they go along totals etc. but it also seems like a huge risk for fraud. thoughts?

trying not to be political. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/18/republican-states-restrict-snap-food-assistance-usda/ (article is paywalled, but available via cached pages )

it looks like some states are changing rules / enforcing different as far as snap and child support, income and resources. i urge everyone to check for recent state changes in state level passed bills relating to snap and other forms of public assistance. the article mentioned ohio, arizona, missouri as well as others.

been trying to look online and not finding anything. mostly interested in texas but other states approval would be encouraging at least.

""usda increases emergency snap benefits for 25 million americans; ensures covid-19 relief reaches those struggling the most"" 

>starting this month, households that had not received at least $95 per month in increased benefits through emergency allotments during the pandemic – because they were already at or close to receiving the current maximum benefit – will now be eligible to receive additional benefits. benefit levels will remain unchanged for households that have been receiving increased payments of at least $95 per month. states may need a few weeks to update their systems and get the additional benefits to participants.

&#x200b;

can someone put this in laymans terms? is this the extra 15% or whatever that's going until september {was june}? or is this something else on top of that? 

&#x200b;

with the rising grocery costs here, it's a struggle honestly even with a full allotment. and we've not been able to fall back on the food pantries we usually do because they've all gone to drive thru's and we have no car.

>under regular [snap eligibility](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility) requirements, students enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education are typically ineligible for snap benefits unless they meet certain specific exemptions. the *consolidated appropriations act, 2021* [temporarily expands](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/provisions-consolidated-appropriations-act-2021) snap eligibility to include students who either:  
>  
>are eligible to participate in state or federally financed work study during the regular academic year, as determined by the institution of higher education; or  
>  
>have an expected family contribution (efc) of 0 in the current academic year. this includes students who are eligible for a maximum pell grant.  
>  
>beginning jan. 16, 2021, students who meet one of the two criteria outlined above may receive snap benefits if they meet all other financial and non-financial snap eligibility criteria. the new, temporary exemptions will be in effect until 30 days after the covid-19 public health emergency is lifted. more information can be found on the [snap benefits for students webpage and q&a on student eligibility](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/students).

posting as i know this comes up often here.

anyone have any guesses what happened here? tx. 

i have been buying some freeze dried items on amazon with my snap. i purchased two identical cans of freeze dried strawberries in a single order yesterday, with the full purchase covered with snap. 

today, it got kicked back for payment issues because snap only covered one can? i don't understand how that can be as it was literally 2 of the same item. i more than had balance to cover it as well. 

anyone have insights into maybe why?

texas. i'm waiting on a snap app since 4/3. still nothing. i've called and they've just told me to wait. i can't go to the office to force it due to lack of transportation. 

&#x200b;

i'm 95% sure i'm moving out of state either the last week of june or the second week of july. if my application isn't processed by then, am i just out of luck since i'll have moved out of state before they processed it? i'm really hoping not as i'm counting on those funds to be able to buy groceries in the new house.

just checking in - applied 4/4, haven't heard anything back yet and it's now 5/19. no interview scheduled, nothing has changed in the system. application just says sent. 

&#x200b;

how far behind is texas running for new applications presently? i know it was 6 weeks+ last time i checked. 

&#x200b;

also...which set of info will they want? the information from when i applied 2 months ago or current? wondering if i need to get another set of documents gathered up.

i know they replaced stuff from the winter storm because that was a declared disaster. will they replace when it isn't? and if so, can we complete the form by calling like before or does it have to be submitted in person because it's not a special recognized situation?

we got hit with a major storm friday night. power was out for 36 hours straight so everything in my fridge is gone. most of the city was back up yesterday, we just were a pocket that took longer.

so i realize this probably isn't even ironed out yet, but any guesses as to how the new monthly child tax credit payments are going to affect things like snap, medicaid, etc? 

&#x200b;

i know usually tax refunds don't count as income because they're a one time payment thing. but this is a monthly payment from july to december unless parents elect to receive it as a part of their usual tax refund. was talking with a friend of mine who has several kids & works & she's worried that especially in larger families, the payments could be high enough to push a family off the benefits cliff for at least some programs. she asked me to look into it and try to find out in time to decline monthly payments & opt for it all in the tax refund if it's going to put her into a worse situation by getting the monthly payments. texas specifically, but it's going to be a question for every state honestly.

has there been any memos or anything in the rumor line regarding corona virus and snap benefits? 

currently waiting on my application to be processed. kinda worried about a major outbreak happening and preventing me from being able to get to the store to use it (i use public transportation and they've already said if it hits here they will shut down buses). i can get groceries delivered but can't use snap for that unfortunately."
"locked account hello, my mom forgot her password and she tried a few times to login on her myaccess, but got locked. i tried calling the customer service number provided several times and they keep hanging up when i choose to speak with a representative. anyone here has any solutions to this? always the same bullshit excuse ""our representatives are currently busy assisting other people""

ps: my state is fl"
"texas snap - got approved for...$20 a month in food stamps? i'm a bit confused here. i did an application, i'm drowning in bills and got approved for $20 a month.

i pay $500/rent, $250-400/utilities, $50/phone, $250/car and insurance, $120/medical insurance(can't get medicaid/care) and only made $1500 a month and now got a hour reduction making it to where i only make around $1300 a month. 

i work from home, but it's self-employment, contract work. i used to have unlimited hours i could work, but now it got cut to 40/week and now it's cut to 30/week with send offs. i average around 25 hours a week, sometimes less - which makes my checks even smaller than what i've been making. 

i did my interview, after waiting over 30 days for the application to be reviewed, i was just transferred to the interview line. she confirmed the information - i sent bank statements over to prove my income, but...as much as i appreciate the money every month, i'm still ridiculously struggling. even if i get a 'free $20 in groceries a month'. plus everything seems to be going up in price. 

does anyone know if i missed something or if they missed something? i'm just confused on the amount."
does the dhhr call your landlord? wv my landlord is horrible and gets mad at every little inconvenience or perceived inconvenience for her. if i apply for food stamps and submit my lease does the dhhr call her to ask questions? i’ll deal with it either way but i’m just trying to prepare for a headache. (she will take it as well if you need food stamps how are you going to afford your rent ) she constantly threatens not to renew my lease.
"disability | residency i have two disabilities, one physical and one psychiatric, of kinds that they ask about on disability disclosure forms for jobs. (i don't disclose in case the form ends up in the wrong hands.) physical clearly impacts me because i have trouble standing or walking for extended periods, although i'm nervously going to give it a try in a kitchen setting with ankle braces and orthotics. but i'm pretty sure ssa would say ""who cares? you have a master's degree, you can get a desk job."" (reality is more complicated.) psychiatric impacts me mainly because i would have to take a leave of absence if i were hospitalized, but my dx is also known to have trouble with stress response and executive function, plus comorbid anxiety makes it tough to drive a car.

anyway i'm pretty sure i can't get disability benefits, but i'm kind of irritated that i can't list myself as disabled on a snap application. or am i wrong?

"getting a job before re-certification hi everyone,

i was unemployed and received calfresh (snap for california), my irt level (income threshold) is n/a. i got a job recently and trying to check whether i need to report the income change. i checked online and it says if irt is n/a, i don't have to report the income change until the next re-certification. does that mean i can continue to collect calfresh until my re-certification, even though i have a job now? will they make me pay it back after i re-certified? thanks."
"florida snap i did my application and have been waiting for it to be fully processed. my bills went up but it’s showing $38 a month rather than 240 i had previously. could the $38 be what they think i should get or just a placeholder amount until it’s finished? 
the system also says i should have received $28 extra for march and april. i didn’t receive either, was i actually supposed to?"
"got $1,000+ stolen from my ebt. calfresh denies it and won't give my money back. what can i do now? i am the only user of my ebt card. i've never lost the card or gave it to anyone.

last week, $1,000 in transactions were processed without my knowledge in a target an hour away from me. all spent within the span of 30 minutes. no idea how that was possible considering i have my card with me.

i called services and submitted a case for each of the ten fraudulent transactions. they shut down my current card and are sending a new one.

few days later, got ten papers in the mail. got all ten cases denied.

feeling hopeless. anything else i can do?

"(texas) single without kids, on unemployment, advice on applying for fs hi, thanks for your time.
so i recently lost my job and was trying to apply for food stamps either tomorrow or the day after and had some questions. 

when i took a week off of work to visit a dying family member, work had replaced me so now i am unemployed... thankfully twc approved my unemployment, but let's be real, it isn't enough to cover food, rent, etc so here i am.

my main concern on why i think i might be denied is because i have about $11,000 in the bank. that money was given to me by the insurance company because i got in a wreck and totaled my car a few months ago. the money is reserved for purchasing a new car.... other than that 11k i have no other assets i can think of.  
is this money in the bank going to be a problem, and will me showing paperwork that this is from the insurance company help at all? 

i am single and 31, with no kids. 
not sure if this is all the info you fine folks need, but please let me know any advice you can give. 

(i believe i am only eligible for 3 months of fs per 3 years... which will help me out greatly!)

thank you."
"unsure of status i’m in md and currently am waiting for my benefits to be deposited in my account for july. my redetermination was completed and says “submitted” in the portal. because i was not working at the time they followed up and asked (via message on portal, not by mail.) for previous paystubs which i submitted immediately. (around june 7th) 

i originally submitted my redetermination documents online and via mail, but only submitted the paystubs online. 

my benefits for june were deposited into my account on the 23rd (normal) and my benefits for july never were deposited. i haven’t received any contact , mail or otherwise saying that my benefits were cancelled or that my case was closed. the online portal for my state still says my case is open and my redetermination has been received. 

i haven’t been able to get ahold of a representative on the customer service line and have experiences of eating upwards of 4 hours on hold (yes i waited the whole time :,))

is there any way for me to figure out if i have had my benefits terminated or my redetermination denied?"
"have my own apartment but spending nearly 100% of time at mom's to help out. please read | i have a pre-hearing in less than 3 hours. question about ""maximum gross income"" illinois | just realized my ebay sales are income and not liquidating assets | preparing for snap interview in illinois. i qualify, right? due to a family emergency i have been staying with my mother since before christmas and may be here for months to help her because she can't do what she needs to on a daily basis by herself at this time.

i have my own apartment and live alone and i entered all that info for snap. illinois.

i strongly prefer to get my groceries delivered. i have really bad anxiety and don't like to go shopping plus i do not drive. however, i'm paranoid if i deliver my walmart+ or amazon fresh groceries to my mom's with snap as payment they will either think i am residing there somehow or that i am giving my groceries to my mother.

would this all be legitimate? do you see any issues with any of this?

thank you so much.

i know gross means total without deductions. does this mean without even deducting self-employment expenses?

for example, on ebay last month my ""total sales"" were $1,012.86. but i only made net $508.01 which includes fees, shipping, and $193.04 that i can prove i bought items for with receipts that i then sold over time.

if it literally does mean gross and it appears i made over $1,000 last month i'm screwed, lol.

&#x200b;

the pre-hearing by the way is because they say i'm not disabled first of all. then we have to figure all this out.

thanks.

edit: no one answered the number i was supposed to call at 2 and no one called me back. no pre-hearing? i guess this is going straight to a hearing??? i left a message at the general number but i doubt that will do anything. the number i was supposed to call just rang 10 times then went busy.

edit 2: got a call about 1.5 hours later. looks like everything is solved now. the expenses are not counted as deductions. but she didn't go by the chart on the link. she said the net number was $2,056 which i was under by $5.

illinois

so i spent over $10,000 on video games in 2019 before this unforseen disability has ruined my life. i am now on ssdi and receiving food stamps. i thought i would be okay to sell my video game collection because after all i spent the money on it and have receipts. however, i recently found out i'm not allowed to cherry pick and i must average out all the games that i bought and that is my ""expense"" per disc that i am allowed to deduct.

so for example if i sell a game for $50 i am only allowed to deduct the average game price of $0.97 from the sales price since i bought them in lots and bulk leaving me with a profit of $49.03.

well i've been selling games all year long and have made a profit of over $4,000 so far...

this would definitely lead to my food stamps going away since i should only be receiving $16 before the boost to whatever the emergency maximum is.

how do i go about reporting this income so late? any idea what the penalty will be? will i have to pay back all these months of maximum food stamps?

thanks for any guidance and help. i feel like such an idiot. i would never try to scam the system.

i just applied for snap because my new disability vocational counselor told me i should definitely be getting it. i receive medicaid as i have $0 income since may '19. however, social security doesn't see me as disabled... i've tried twice. but i answered the question on the snap application, do they see me as disabled or do i have a disability that has prevented me from working for at least 12 months. i have the medical paperwork to back up my claim if it comes to it. to at least show that i'm not intentionally lying... it's a mental illness so social security thinks i can work through it.

anyway, i live with my parents but do not share food. i am pretty positive i qualify as my own household even though i live here as i was really worried about it on my medicaid application and looked into it extensively. i also pay them rent and put that amount as my rent. i put that i do not pay any utilities and strictly rent.

should i qualify for snap in illinois? do you need more info to know? did i answer anything that would disqualify me?

i just want to know now so i don't waste anyone's time going to the office if i am not supposed to get the benefit.

thank you!"

basically, my question is: will loans from friends and repayments from a friend or roommate for loans or things i purchased for them be counted as income? will i likely be asked for statements from my friend and my roommate after the caseworker looks at my bank statement?"

"tn foodstamps cut by $700 i have a family of five in tn, consisting of myself, my wife, and our three children 13, 8, and 5. our ebt benefits are deposited on the first of the month. today, our amount seems to have been reduced by $700. we were receiving 1200 for a while, then 1000 last month, then today only $300 was deposited. i'm the only person working, making 850 gross each week ($a little under 700 after taxes). our rent is 1250, 100 for phone bill, about 300-350 utilities. of course there are other bills, but i don't recall having to list them on our application. does this sound right? were our emergency benefits $700? i'm kind of freaking out, as it will be tough for us to all eat on what we were given.

"[az] received abawd notice for arizona, 3 months benefits in 3 year period, anyone in az trying to resolve this too? hi, so i am on nutrition assistance in arizona, i received the notice that on october 1st, the time limit rules will start again for able bodied adults without dependents(abawd).  i had partial month(\~40% of monthly benefit) for august, and one full benefit for september so far.  there is an exemption if i have applied for unemployment insurance which i have and is pending approval, i can get unemployment for 3 more months, final week is in december.  does this mean i should get monthly food benefits stopping in january?

if you are in az, i am  trying to upload the abawd form to health e arizona, but i don't see anywhere i can upload a document even though the mailed letter des sent me tells me i can use the site for this.  anyone also in az and figured this out yet?  thanks!

"will food stamp benefits disappear after moving to a new state and getting a new job that would disqualify me? in the near future, i will be taking on a new job in a new state that would disqualify me from food stamps. 

will the benefits i have now still remain in my card? will i still be able to use my card in the new state? and for how long can i use it if so? i definitely plan on reporting my income when i move which would disqualify me, but i want to still be able to use my remaining benefits, if possible. 

thanks all, super grateful for this program."

"question about discontinued case | question on how to best navigate lapse in benefits? i called in for an renewal appointment yesterday and while on the phone with the eligibility worker she told me i had to complete a sar-7 first. apparently although i submitted it online in june, it was never approved. while doing the sar-7 there was a document i needed to submit, and was told i needed to call back. 

this morning i saw my case had been discontinued. am i still able to speak with someone to renew my case or will i have to start the process all over? 

i’m in la county

my recertification is due at the end of january and i have to have an interview. with my current income i most likely will not be eligible for renewal. however, my current job is temporary and will be ending at the end of january as well, so i won’t have any income at that time. 

so would my benefits lapse for february and i would then reapply and be approved for march?"
"nj: can i be approved for snap if i have money in a brokerage account, and grant money? | just got approved for snap (nj). what are the limitations at the grocery store? so my income is low, about 1.5k/month. but i also have 6k in a brokerage account (the 6k is grant money), that i withdraw from when i need to make ends meet to pay bills. my rent is $1,380.

do you think i’d be eligible for food stamps, or would they look and say that i have 6k stashed away and think that i don’t need it? the truth is i am able to meet all my bills when i factor in my grant money from my brokerage account, but it’s still a struggle now that groceries are so expensive.

as for my rent cost, $1,380 for a studio is actually a great price where i live in nj, and i only do that because i’m a student and living on campus would come out to roughly $1,500/month, so while a $1,380/month studio apartment may be considered a luxury, it’s actually cheaper than living in campus. i couldn’t find anything near a train station (i don’t have a car) with roommates which is why i opted for a studio (my apartment is right by a train station).

anyway thanks for any help!

i like to cook so i’m excited to be able to buy fresh ingredients, but i’m wondering if snap would also cover things like frozen pizzas? i don’t buy that stuff very often but just wondering if i go to the checkout and have something like that in my cart if it will be covered or not."

we're in south carolina.

i applied for foodstamps 2 months ago here in south carolina and i havent heard anything back. i applied online, and when i go to the portal i can see that my application was completed and the date that it was submitted, but i cant see the status. they give you a number to call and check the status but you have to have a case number, which i dont have yet. should i try applying again or will that cause a fuss?"

i have a lot less than the maximum they require in savings and my last months income was less than what i pay in rent so i assume i qualify for expedited. 

should i expect the card to arrive considering there's nothing else they need, or should i expect a call even though it has already been 3 days since i applied?"

florida food stamp error? applied at the end of july and got an approval letter after all verifications were completed. it's now the end of september and nothing has been loaded on my card despite being approved for august-december. there are no pending benefits on my card either. has anyone else had this happen? i don't know if it's an access issue or a problem with my actual card.

"[ny] i applied on the 27th and i haven’t heard anything. i called my local dss 3 times asking how i would go about getting emergency benefits and i’m being given different answers on my first call i was told that i need to wait a week post-application before they can determine my eligibility for emergency benefits. on my second call i was told that i have to wait until my application is processed and approved before they could determine my eligibility for emergency benefits (what is the point of emergency benefits if this is the case?) and on my third call they flat out told me that they *don’t have* emergency benefits??

folks - a family member lives with us for a long time in a room we’ve provided in our house and we provide only shelter, nothing else. he’s been able to qualify for medicaid - the office simply deemed him to be a household of one. he now needs food stamps too. given we all live under the same shelter, is the review process similar to medicaid and will they also consider him to be a household of one. he prepares his own meals and has a mini fridge in his room. thanks"
"actual income different from what they have i live hawaii, my question is i have tried to apply for snap a couple times but always get rejected because i make over the limit. but what i do to understand is why is my gross income that i submitted with my paystubs different from the number the snap office has? (they always have a higher gross income than what i make) 

also how do the poverty guidelines work because under 200% gross income and net income i should qualify but for 130% i miss the cut?"
"why is the date no longer mentioned? hi there. thanks for the help. so my stamps were to end on january 8th. so i did my over the phone interview and got approved on december 15th. 

i just now noticed, despite being approved, when i call the automated number it now only says my current amount and no longer includes how much longer its good for (as before, i thought it would say january 2024 as next reval)

i called twice, and both people on the phone said it's nothing to worry about and the automated message just needs to update, but i'm still nervous. 

i'd hate, for some reason, for february 8th to come around and have 0 on my card"

"the legality of friends borrowing ebt this is taking place in alabama. im in oklahoma but i'm inquiring because this is effecting a 5th person not included in the post below. 

let's call her, sharon. sharon gets ebt for herself and her 2 dependants. her two 2 dependants left their ebt card with their friend and allegedly gave her permission to use the card. she spent roughly $100. 
they are now all three in a dispute over a different subject and the friend is concerned what will happen should they report her for using the card. 
she allegedly has text message evidence that they gave her permission to use the card. 

if they do report the friend, what is the actual likely outcome? 

seeing as how the card can only be used by whoever was listed on the application sheet, they all four would face repercussions, correct?"

is anyone else getting extra benefits right now? maybe because of the pandemic? should i say something or just count my blessings lol!

(note: my net income is low, but gross income can be sometimes high)

this is in reference to a previous post where i asked about how a day trader can qualify for snap since snap relies on gross income. example net income might be $1000/month but gross could be $3000 with $2000 in losses.

"30 days is almost up with no decision | what are the chances of going approved in michigan? | 6 month review last month on the 27th i applied for food assistance in michigan. on thursday i missed a call from a case worker while i was at work. there was no appointment set up so i didn’t know when to expect a call. she left a voicemail saying she’d set up an appointment but i’m free to call earlier. no appointment was added to my account, and i’ve tried calling friday as well as today but no answer. i understand it’s holiday season so she may be out of the office, but with tomorrow being the 27th will i be denied for not having an interview? is there wiggle room because of the holidays? thanks in advance for any help, i appreciate it.

my boyfriend and i recently applied for food assistance as we’re struggling to keep up. he is unemployed and has no income (he’s been looking for jobs but it’s pretty competitive and unfortunately he can’t drive), and i work part time while going to school full time. i bring in $700-$900ish a month, and rent is $945 a month. we’ve made it this far off my savings and i will get some money from my school in january to help with living costs. at this point though i’ve been putting everything i can on my credit card to make sure i can pay rent. i did explain this in the additional comments section and how my credit card total is higher than what i actually have. i’m mostly concerned they’ll see i have $1300 in my bank and deny the application because of it. any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!

we live in michigan and have been getting benefits for a couple months now. we received notice to complete a 6 month review recently or our benefits would be cancelled. the thing is, we’re kind of ready for them to end. my boyfriend has just moved up to full time hours, which should set us well over our income limit of only $1900. 

would there be any other consequences other than benefit cancellation if we don’t do the review? would we also be able to use up the remaining benefits on the card once they end?

investigator came to my home first post here. i was approved for emergency food stamps on wednesday but wouldn’t have the funds until thursday morning. i used them thursday evening for groceries. friday early afternoon i got a visit from to investigators from the fraud inspection or something and they were looking for my ex boyfriend. they didn’t say why but clearly it has something to do with my food stamps. when i was asked on the phone who all lives in the home i was honest and said just the baby and i because my now ex boyfriend and i recently split. his stuff is still here and he comes and goes but we don’t eat together nor does he technically still live here. i’m worried i did something wrong or i’m going to get into trouble. when i googled it it said you can get a felony or other serious criminal offenses for lying about income but i didn’t lie :( i don’t understand why they would approve me and the next day send out an investigator. i wouldn’t have spent any of that money if i would have known i did something wrong.

"(mo) do i have to pay funds back if pending acceptance denied? i applied at the end of july and was interviewed in early august. the interviewer said she was going to give me conditional acceptance for august and load the funds but i would have to send some documentation to get accepted for real. i had a list of what needed to be on the documentation and made sure it had everything. i sent it in before the deadline i was given. my application was rejected anyway and my status is showing closed. the letter i got on friday says i didn't have the documentation (i don't understand what happened but that's not my question)

i'm in milwaukee wisconsin and i'm trying to renew my food share benefits in the end of may when the renewal isn't until july apparently i can do so as long as i renew my medicaid benefits at the same time. what's got me confused and worried is the cautionary statement saying there is a possibility that i could lose my benefits by renewing early. not that i positively will lose them or positively won't, only a possibility.. has anyone else seen or experienced this? has anyone successfully renewed early without losing their benefits? i'm not certain i want to take the chance, albeit it's something that if i do do (<haha do do. hopefully no one is too uptight on this sub.) successfully it will really alleviate some monetary stress. thanks for reading and any advice!"
"venting. roommate lied on his snap application & did fraud and now uses all his ebt to buy soda and red bull.. my roommate who never once paid rent as agreed (can't evict yet due to covid law!) got food stamps about 3 weeks ago.  he lied on his application.  he told them that he was making his own food and buying it separately so that his app wouldn't be based on his other roommates' wages. if he used our info on the application, he'd have been denied.  he marked down that for the past 6 months he's been buying his own food.  thus,  he got retro pay.  it was a lie.

i told him 3 weeks ago that he needs to contact our county's welfare board and explain that he will not be using the retro pay,  as it's illegal, but that he could still use future snap, as long as he didn't share food with us.  he had replied that he doesn't care if he goes to jail. i explained that he put me in a bad spot! he only thinks of himself.   how about the fact that now i have this weighing on my mind that he was stealing from those who needed it??? and that he got retro pay that he banked off of, when the ""retro"" reality was actually all my money spent on him?!

so,  i reported him to snap.  i don't really feel bad. i even warned him that i would be reporting him if he didn't comply.  he knew he was making me feel uncomfortable.  he also isn't starving.  he spent all the back pay on convenience-store-purchased red bull and a ton of soda. i'm talking about $35 a day just on soda.    granted, he did buy a few banquet frozen dinners. the bulk was candy bars.  that's what he's eating all day.   

how is it even legal that he can buy nothing but red bull and soda?  he's clearly taking advantage of the system.  how are there not ""caps"" on certain items? surely,  one does not need 3 cans of red bull per day.  that's also bad on his heart. and $10/ day on nonsense.  i understand you may think it's none of my business what he spends his ebt money on,  but it sort of is.   regardless,  the snap program is broken.  


 now he ran out of snap and expects to eat here. like i'm gonna turn away a hungry person? he knows i won't turn him away because i have a heart,  but i'm enabling him. he put me in a catch 22, preying on my weakness.  he's soon to be legally evicted,  as the courts here are finally starting to hear cases again after its ~6 month hiatus. 

just venting!! but any input is appreciated!"

"nyc snap/cash aisstance | re: nyc snap and march 2023 | why the delay in getting snap card in mail?? | snap card question i applied for snap and are receiving my question is with cash assistance.

i applied for cash assitance (not the one shot ca) on: 1/19/23 and had my phone interview on 2/4/23. i gave all my documentation & letters from hra that they were recieved. i was told by interviewer that i should get a response within 5-7 business days. yes i do know there is a back log in processing peoples applications. is there any way of finding out, since it's now 2/27/23, when i could hear back about a decision w/ my application. when i called to check i only got an automated response of my application is still being processed. should i go to my processing center on bergen st, in bklyn to see if i can get a better idea of when a response will be given?  thanks for any assistance!

greetings,

i have nyc snap as a single person\~ $281 per month. yet recieved a letter with the announcement that the emergency allotment added (during co-vid) will end at the end of feburary. yet they never mentioned what my snap amount will be when it's issued on march 2nd, 2023, when the extra funds go away? 

can anyone share what my march snap will be, so i can plan accordingly. appreciate. 

also, i applied for cash assistance on 1/19/23, with documents, i  had my phone interview on a saturday on 2/4/23. yet when i log on to hra access\~ it is not documented there that i had an interview? today is 2/14/23 and still do not see?  in these day an age of technology\~it should be shown i had a confirmed interview, even with yes understanding hra is backed logged. can anyone give insights for this and should i go to my local hra office at bergen st to make sure, my interview has been confirmed and documented? appreciate! thanks

i received a letter of acceptance for snap nyc on dec 30th 2022 ok great. i go log into my hra account to see such and also the amount given for the month of january 2023 on 1/3/2023 yet i have not received a snap card in mail & it's now 1/11/23. i tried several times to call to no avail just keeps ringing. i find local snap center call and when told to leave a message \~they say mail box full!!!! when reaching where snap center is\~ i have to travel on a bus to center to actually speak in person to get answers! this is so fustrating to say the least!  get this i received a letter today 1/12/23 thinking ok snap card\~no! it just a letter stated they received all documents for applying. truly fustrating to say the least of now wasting my time to travel to be able to speak to someone for answers!

i just got a letter in the mail that i was approved for snap\~ i live in brookkly, ny. how long does it take for a snap card to be mailed out? also does the card we get have a strip to swipe when paying? 

the reason i am asking is, one local specialty food store in my neighborhood said they will only except ebt snap cards that have a stripe to swipe for payment. 

thanks for any assistance to my question."
"advice needed on snap reactivation state ca

my sister and her kids been receiving ebt and just last month her baby daddy got into a car accident. he and her haven’t been together for a good while. not sure why now? maybe he saw his life flashing before his eyes. 

he stupidly told medi-cal that he and my sister were fiancé. because of that the lady on the other line grouped them together. that affected her ebt. so she’s no longer receiving it. 

what can she do? ebt is asking for his information, but my sister refuses to send it and let ebt deactivate. can she submit applications 6month from now? (i know they’re gonna split again)."

"calfresh proof san diego county college student

i received a letter today in the mail asking me to submit proof of my income and identification before the deadline in a couple days. it says that if i dont mail them the proof by the deadline than my benefits may be denied so im super confused. i submitted my application about a week ago and haven't received a phone call yet which i assume is normal. i submitted the proof online on the [getcalfresh.org](https://getcalfresh.org) website so my question is do i need to mail them my information again? it would be pretty inconvenient to print copies of everything its asking for in the mail when i already sent that information on the online application. i tried calling them today but the answering machine left me confused so here i am asking yall for help."

i logged into the ebt edge app and it says i have over $6 000, there's a payment for $750 and the rest are $40 but it doesn't let me see anything before the $750. i was on food stamps in 2018 for a little while but i'm not sure why i have that much. any answers would be great while i'm waiting on a call back, i'm afraid to spend any 👀"
"question about payment | why do we keep losing benefits? | are there any reasons as to why food stamps would be cut off? hello all. sorry if this sounds repetitive but i don't really know how all of this works, my mom handles all of this but doesn't really tell me anything. i want to get a part time job so i can help my family buy groceries. we're getting screwed over with food stamps. they reduced the amount my family received because i was a full time student. however i'm back home and they know i'm home but still cut it off. my brother receives ssdi i'm not sure how much though. so my question is would me getting a part time job affect these benefits. i know now that someone in the house has to be working to get food stamps as i've been told on reddit before. my mom keeps saying i can't get a job because the rent will increase but at this point we need to pick a struggle. she has no job and neither does my father. i'm the only one with a college degree so i want to help my family. i'm in the stage of new york btw. my brother is 20 and i'm 22.

ooh also my mom says that she has to tell ssa if i'm just applying to jobs. i don't know how this will affect benefits because just applying to a job doesn't mean i'm guarantee a job so does she have to report that i'm applying or can she just report the chnage after i'm officially employed. if anyone can point me to subreddits that deal with this that would greatly eb appreciated.

so i'm 22 just graduated college living back at home with no job. webarena family of 5. no one is working. i have two disabled siblings, a father who doesn't work because of a disability. and my mother was recently terminated from her job. i was away for college and my mom said they lowered the food stamps. however they know i am back home living with them but they keep cutting off the food stamps. it's really stressing me and my mom out. i feel like they keep screwing us over. we are in nyc btw. also if someone is able to tell me how our benefits would be affected if i were to get a part time job please let me know. because my mom also said that if i get a job our rent will increase, but she is no longer working and we can't keep living like this.

so i'm in ny and i'm ab audlt (22)  just graduated college not working. i have 2 other siblings, 1 is a minor and they are both disabled. my mother reapplied for food stamps but for some reason they got cut off. idk why they did and i'm not going to ask my mother because tbh she is a difficult person to talk to. she will get mad for no reason. i was wondering if i could just get some possible reasons we aren't receiving food stamps anymore.

edit: i should add that my mom did the recertification or whatever it's called maybe two weeks ago definitely not longer than that. so idk if we're getting ir and i just have to be patient or if they're completely cut off."

"irt change | update on this post. help if possible because i don’t want i get in trouble 🥲😅 | help if possible. so i updated my income it’s a bit wonky because how i’m self employed. anyways, i put the most i made in the past 3 months as my monthly income. that being said i got a notification that my benefit amount changed which was expected but my thing is my irt shows as n/a as of now. and well so far this month i made over my old irt. so my question is do i  technically still have to report it? also i want to add i do have an appt next month for the renewal if i still qualify.

so i called the office on monday. i don’t have a specific case worker anymore it’s just the office in general now. anyways i called the they were no help at all they told me to do everything online. and i told them i called because i didn’t know how to report it online. so anyways i updated my account but like how i’m self employed i make different amounts every month so i just said i make around at most 2600 monthly and chose 40% for business expenses basically and the edd income. but my problem is how to report the increased income from last month. it doesn’t give me an option for that so i just put it as report “other”  and explained that on the month of july we had an increased of income because i was able to work more hrs and because of my partners edd income came in that month. but i wasn’t able to show proof or anything it’s literally them just taking my word for it😅. is this the correct way to do it? i’m just so lost and do not want to be in trouble for something i wanted to report but i’m just clueless on how to do it.

so i got my cal fresh last year and as of 4 months ago the main provider(my partner) lost his job. i took on the role on being the main provider as a amazon flex worker, so technically self employed. mainly because i have 2 kids and one is autistic who has therapy everyday and we only have one car so i need a extra flexible work schedule. so my first month i made about (may) 2,600, on june it was 2400 mainly because i got a job offer and it wasn’t as expected when it came to pay i end up leaving the job and continued flex. on july i made 4,571.50 because of prime week… pay was a lot higher and you were able to work 10 hrs a day instead of the 8. i took full advantage and even borrow a loved ones car for my partner to take our child to therapy while i worked. and on august as of now 1812. my thing is my partner applied for edd on june and the pay got back tracked and he received the card by the end of july. but i wasn’t made aware that he received the card until a couple days ago. so my thing is how screwed am i? mainly because i know our irt is 3007 but because how i’m “self employed” i barely made the cut in july but the edd money messed that up a lot. what’s the worst i can expect or what should i do?"
"did anyone receive the last $95 early? i usually receive the pandemic $95 and my usual amount of $281 at the same time on the same day, which is the 5th. but this month on the 28th, i seemed to have received february's $95 early? did this happen to anyone else? i'm not complaining, i'm just surprised and wonder if it's an error."
"proof of assets-oh so ive never been asked to provide proof of my assets before and i'm not sure if i really even need to? on the generic reapplication form it asks me to list monetary assets and attach proof. but i have not received anything asking me specifically for proof of assets. i don't have much, it's definitely below the 5,000$ threshold and only bolstered right now bc of the deposit of my tax return. 
if i do need to provide proof, how do i do so? is a screenshot of my account balance sufficient? it makes me feel kind of icky inside/ like my privacy is being violated by offering up my account statement for the entire month. i guess i'm probably just being weird but the thought of someone going through my day to day transactions and knowing what stores i shop at on certain days of the week just seems way too personal."

thanks guys!"
"question about counted income? my mom and brother got denied snap. the denial letter says that counted income is double what she actually gets a month. i have no clue how that figure was calculated. the only other expenses listed was a mortgage and something else, neither of those match what she pays. how do they come up with numbers? there’s also a $1,400 max monthly income figure, does that sound right for 1 or 2 person household?

"texas: credit union loans and vehicle equity my family no longer has any income after social security disability mistook a severance payment from my former employer in 2020 as wages for work - i'm appealing. i'm looking into all of our financial options, one of which is bankruptcy. when i spoke with an attorney, i learned a new word: cross-collateralization. essentially, my cars (financed at a credit union) are collateral that secures not only the car loans, but all of my loans with the credit union, including credit cards, which i'm in default and can no longer pay. so i have a car that's worth $20,000, but if i try to sell it, the credit union won't release the title unless they're paid $35,000 - the $15,000 still owed on the loan, plus my $20,000 credit card debt. essentially, there's less than zero equity, and it's impossible for me to sell the car.

none of this is obvious, other than a clause in the fine print of my auto loan agreement that says in effect, *""the security interest created by this \[auto loan\] shall also secure all of my other indebtedness to you""*

bottom line, a calculation of ""car value minus loan balance"" would show i have $6,000 equity in the car. but that equity doesn't exist. i'd need to pay $15,000 to get rid of the car (no way i can do that).

all of this will be settled in a couple of months, but i need to feed my disabled wife and kids now. i spent the last few days reading the *texas works handbook*, but this is isn't a typical case as far as i can tell.

does anybody have some advice on how i can handle this in my application without waiting for a decline and then an appeal to a higher power? sincerest thanks!"

"last ea payment new york? | no update, no regular stamps | day 7 no food stamps after renewal | no food stamps. | waived phone interview? ny anyone outside of the city receive their last $95 payment yet! read that outside city was feb 24th and inside was feb 28th..

upstate new york here, i've posted a view times but not sure what to do anymore. i had to recertify in january to get my february stamps. i recertified on 1/6/23 online. i got a voicemail from snap on 1/10/23 saying they were waiving my interview and i was all set. i thought i was fine until the last week of january, i checked my benefits account and saw the status to the recertification was still on submitted. i've been calling my local office almost everyday and leaving voicemails because they don't have humans answer the phone. 

someone told me to contact the county manager so i did on 2/3/23 and a few hours later i got a call back from someone at the snap office telling me they see that my application was accepted on 1/10 and they did waive my interview. they said they were backed up and i was pretty much waiting in line to be processed and if my stamps aren't on my card in next few days to call back. well it's february 11th, over 30 days since i've sent in and they accepted my recertification.  application status is still saying submitted. 

called the county manager office a few times and they told me to just keep waiting. i called yesterday and said it's friday and i still haven't heard anything or received stamps. she told me she was going to send them a message. every single day i keep checking and every single day it's not there. is this normal? i mean aren't they supposed to get back to you within 30 days? i feel like they're gonna keep stringing me along until they tell me i have to apply again. i've left atleast 10 to 12 voicemails with my name and case number, begging them to call me back. i don't have transportation to go in person. i just don't know if anyone else has experienced this.

im in upstate new york. i get my stamps on the 1st of every month. i recertified on time on january 6th and they waived interview and accepted everything on jan 10th so i can new month in february. i know they are behind and are still processing.. but do they not realize how much people rely on this help? i have dragged out the food we had for as long as i could and have no clue what i'm feeding my kids for the next days to come. who knows how long this is going to go on for. i don't have transportation to get to food pantries. i don't understand if everything was accepted on january 10th, why can't they just put the payment through. i barely survived making it to the 1st to begin with, now this week has felt like forever. not sure how much further we can go.

if counties are waiving interviews then why hasn't my information been updated since i recertified on january 6th. on the government website where i apply/recertify, the status still says submitted and the budget that ended january 31st.. i got a voicemail few weeks ago saying they were waiving interview. so why is it after midnight and my stamps aren't there?!? does waiving the phone interview mean not updating my case so i don't receive them? i'm so confused and frustrated. the panic has of course set in.

i was wondering if new york was waiving phone interviews. i recertified on january 6th and got a voicemail like a week later from a worker saying that the interview was waived and i was set. so i thought i was good. so the other day i checked my recertification on mybenefits and the application status only says submitted. and shows the budget that ended in january. my voicemails got deleted so i can't go back and listen to make sure i heard the right thing. i'm worried that in 2 days my food stamp won't be on my card. shouldn't it be showing the new budget already? and say competed not submitted?"
"texas renewal not processed | approved after max was deposited my benefits were up for renewal and due by the 31st of may. i filled out my form on may 3rd. i didn’t send any files in because nothing changed. i was also never contacted by anyone. i looked online and noticed there is no schedule for my next amount. it still says i’m approved and my renewal date is 5/31 but it also says it isn’t time to renew. i have no new forms or letters. and it only says my renewal has been sent. it has not been reviewed or anything. i don’t know what to do. i have five kids and need this money soon. i’m so worried.

i am in texas and just got approved for my renewal. i am curious if i will get the max benefit for the month like everyone else if i wasn't approved until after the max was dispersed for everyone else. does anyone know?"

"implementation of hot food restrictions hi.  i'm trying to get a sense of how the hot food restrictions play out on the ground, and am wondering if people could share their experiences.

i'm particularly interested in some of the areas where the rules are potentially unclear, and may in practice depend on how the store programs their registers.  for example, are cold rotisserie chickens allowed?  what about salad bars within a grocery store?  is hot soup rejected?  what about gazpacho from the same soup bar?  is there something that you're sure was eligible that was rejected?

in transparency, i work for an advocacy organization, and we'd love to include some of these examples in our work.  i will not quote you directly unless you explicitly give permission.  feel free to message me directly if you have questions or concerns.

thank you"
"[arkansas] letter in mail says i missed my phone appointment when i did not miss it letter in the mail from dhs says i missed my phone interview for snap wednesday. wednesday morning i answered dhs call for interview right on time, went through the entire interview, and the lady said she would get back to me eventually.

"questions about disability and food stamps (alabama) i’m not sure if anyone can answer this, but i wanted to ask before i have to call. 

i am disabled and currently have an active/in progress application for disability. (it has not been approved, it’s just in process of being reviewed) 
i told snap this when i called and they sent me a form for my dr to fill out that would wave the requirement for looking for work.  

but, they also approved my application before i got it signed. 
my dr is giving me a hard time about the form (they think it’s fmla) so i haven’t gotten it signed yet.

is there a reason they approved me before they got the form? 
i’m scared to use the balance on the ebt card just incase my dr takes longer to sign or i have to ask a different dr"
"how to tell if the amount you receive is right? i have googled the income guidelines and all of that for tn and it looked like we would get the maximum benefit amount for a family of four ($646). instead, we got either what i assume is the minimum, i misinterpreted the chart, or i somehow messed up my application and no one caught it. i put my children and my husband on there when i filed and my husband is our only income (2,360 gross monthly income). we were allotted $107/mo. does this seem correct even with two minor dependents? we rent our home, own a 20+ year old car, and pay basic utilities. i didn’t have hardly anything in my account and no cash on hand when i applied. i’m really happy to have any assistance but if we qualify for more and it’s a clerical error i’d like to fix it."

"qualifying income based on monthly or annual? i'm confused about income qualifications. is it how much i make this year or how much i make per month that will be used to calculate whether i qualify or not?

i make around $20/hour 40 hours per week, which would be too high to qualify for benefits as a single person. however, on an annualized basis, i would qualify if factored in that i did not work for four months this year. eight months of my hourly rate in a year would put me under the annual income limit."

i already submit to them the rent and the lease. i am a little confused.

"(nj) granted ebt oddly fast. received letter in mail and am confused | does a case i'd generate on app submission or benefits approval so i had applied for stamps on like july 23rd, was interviewed by phone a few days later and believing if i was granted stamps i wouldn't get any until september i was shocked to find a $309 deposit come august 1st.

i've now received a letter stating whether ive been accepted and for how much or if i was denied. since i was accepted there was a check in the acceptance box. the following sentence says the amount granted and had $309 above the line. my confusion is that the following sentence said how much i will receive in the following months but the area the amount should've been filled in was blank. this seems like a printing error right? it did also say i'm approved for a while. if i'd only been approved for a single month then it would've said $0 for the following months?

this afternoon a caseworker called in and processed my interview. she seemed combative until she asked why i left a part time gig at panera and after my response explaining i was struck by a truck and non mobile for 6 months and will never fully recover her tone lightened significantly.

wanting to get through the questions and get off the call i didn't notice until after i hung up that she didn't say if i was approved or denied. i can't see why i'd be denied, i've no income,assets,or income she would be able to see nor did i fall for her bait questions and walk into a lie. shortly after that the interview was finished, she said thank you for my time and hoped a speedy recovery. i'm not 100% but i kinda remember being told if i was approved or denied after interview. am i wrong? am i right but they changed process?

 the last time i applied for stamps the interviewer asked if i'm employed and i responded i was not and have not for a while. i was promptly informed welfare now has their shit together with the response being ""wait so you didn't work at panera or this dog care facility"" i responded that i did but didn't mention them because my income was 2 or 3k in over 9 months, which didn't matter because the work wasn't why the question was asked it was asked to see if my response would be the truth or a lie."
"as i get most of my income from doordash now as an i.c., how can i prove my earnings to dcf so that they'd determine how much ebt benefits i receive? my earnings summary can be screenshotted, but my name won't show up. i also can't visit a food benefits worker in-person due to the pandemic. i screenshotted my earnings summary page from the doordash app and printed them out and put them in dcf's mailbox right outside of their office. i got a letter from them a couple of weeks later saying they needed my pay statements *with my name on it.* doordash doesn't provide pay stubs; they're not a traditional employer. my 1099 form won't arrive from them until january. i'm an independent contractor, not an employee.

"proof of unemployment benefits ending (florida) so i was previously on unemployment due to a temporary leave from my job. i exhausted my claim and eventually my leave ended and i returned to my job. i submitted my renewal of snap benefits and received a letter requesting that i submit proof that my unemployment benefits ended. 

i don't have an official statement or letter from deo to submit. best i could do was upload a pdf of my account page that states the balance is $0 and the claim is exhausted to the portal, but i don't know if that will be accepted as valid proof. i've called the case worker many times and left several voicemails, as well as tried calling the snap hotline, but can't seem to get ahold of anyone.

"access hra app and trouble uploading documents i'm applying in new york and having trouble getting the access hra app to recognize my documentation, and was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and knows what to do.

the primary issue is all of my documents are in pdf form, but the access hra app only allows you to ""take a photo"" or ""select a photo."" pdfs appear to not be recognized.

initially i assumed this just meant i needed to convert the pdfs to jpgs, which are recognized by the access hra app. access hra is able to see the .jpgs in my phone's camera folder, in my screenshot folder.... virtually, all jpgs.

but when i converted my pdfs to jpgs and saved them to those same folders, the access hra app still can't find them. i tried png files too, just to see if that changed it, but there's still no luck.

i'm 100% certain the newly made and converted files are in the correct folders. i've even tried things like moving them to the screenshots folder, where i can see the access hra app allows me to select from, but the app for some reason just doesn't recognize the documentation. frustratingly, it does recognize new photos, new screenshots.

i've reset my phone several times and logged in and out of the app even more times, but this hasn't helped.

does anyone know what might be going on?

i was hoping i could do a workaround of individually taking photos of each and every page on my monitor, but those come out too wavy and grainy to be readable."

"if you designate an authorized representative, is it still your name on the ebt card? and do you get sent 1 card or 2 cards? (california) | [calfresh] question about emergency allotment i'm helping an elderly relative with their calfresh application.  the application section for authorized representative has 2 parts: 1) if you want to designated an ar to help file our case, and 2) if you want an ar to be able to use your benefits.

i'm filling out ""yes"" for #1 since i am helping them fill out the application.  my question is if we say ""yes"" for #2:

1. how many cards do they send my relative?  1 card or 2 cards (i.e. one for me, one for him?)
2. if they send 1 card, is it under my relative's name or under my name?  if they send 2 cards, are both cards under my relative's name or does each card have a different name?

these are the questions my relative was curious about, and it wasn't very clear on the application.  all we know is that the authorized representative can buy food for the beneficiary but the ebt card situation is unclear.

thank you to anybody who is on calfresh who has experience with authorized reps and can give clarification on this topic.

hi, i have a relative who is on calfresh who signed up for calfresh in january and has a question about how the emergency allotment worked.  when they were approved in  january it said their monthly amount was $200 and they would receive it at the beginning of each month.  in late march they got a $95 credit which is supposedly from the emergency allotment.  but apparently the emergency allotment program is ending.  does this mean that starting in april they will only get $105 a month, or will they continue to get $200/month?  


basically, while the emergency allotment program was running, were people getting 2 balance credits per month: their approved amount at start of month + a separate credit of $95 on top at the end of the month?  or was it a single monthly credit that included the $95, and now that the program is ending that single credit will go down by $95?"

"snap pa-allegheny county work requirement? | pa-snap questions, rent change, income change hey guys question. trying to help my cousin with this stuff. is there a snap/foodstamp work requirement in pa-allegheny county for the benefit?

trying to help my cousin figure this stuff out. it's somewhat confusing. my cousin is living with a friend (old man) since late 2021. hasn't been paying rent due to man being nice and also helping him with stuff (he's done a lot for him). no job, has been dealing with a lot of health issues (hospitalized a bunch of times but is much better now). has snap and medicaid. snap is maxed out i believe like $281 a month. food money obviously helps a lot. medication is $1 a month rather than $45 a month. originally he didn't use the snap for like 9 months or something because his uncle's gave him a ton of frozen and canned food. surprised they never canceled it. 

old man is very sick now (physically and mentally-dementia) and he can't live there anymore. old man is getting really crazy. has to find a new place asap. like as soon as humanly possible. room is filling with sewage daily when water is run too long. he's going to get sick. main line is broken or something. old man doesn't care and cousin can't fix it. and he's getting really crazy and accusatory (accusing him of crazy stuff he didn't do) and threatening him. he could end up sleeping in his car. 

cousin has a friend who lives in a nice, small, but cheap apartment not too far away. only $700 utilities included. they have one unit left. they're going to let him in it soon seems like because of his personal connection. he also found a stopgap job for some income. guy is going to let him tag along and help cut grass with him starting in march and pay him cash. sounds like he'll make around $1200 a month doing that. not a lot of hours, 20 something a week. not much but better than nothing. 

should he call his caseworker to report this now? or mail something instead to them? does anyone know how this will affect his monthly snap payment? medicaid? thanks."

"ebt balance is more than what is said in the approval letter? we applied for calfresh in july. we received the approval letter in the mail that said our monthly amount will be $350. the first month will have a bit extra due to the prorated benefit from the month of application. 

we got the card today. when we logged into the website to check the balance. the first month amount (aug) and the prorated amount (july) are matching with what the letter said. however, the second month (sep) amount shows $467, and the upcoming month amount which is still pending is $504. why is it increasing every month? is this an error, or are they just adjusting the allowed benefit? i heard they had some pandemic/emergency fund added in the past, but i believe that program was ended. we are hesitating to use the card now because we don’t know if the amounts are correctly deposited.

i then proceeded to speak with a calfresh representative through the helpline and they said that the account is still active and has a balance, along with everything being correct on their end with no issues. they told me to contact the county office tomorrow and get another card issued to me.

has this ever happened to anyone else ? i find it weird that a card can just be canceled randomly without notice if everything is correct and active. i'm also afraid that maybe someone has my card number and was the one to cancel it, but that doesn't really make sense to me either.

edit: so i went down to the human services building and they said there's been an increase in ebt fraud so they've been cancelling ebt cards and sending out new ones without notice. i was able to get a replacement right then and there instead of waiting for it in the mail. i'll leave this up in case anyone else faces the same problem as me in the future."

"how do i not qualify?? i live in ny. i rent an apartment for 1000 a month and work a minimum wage job. i also pay all my bills, electric, internet, car insurance. i am barely getting by so i applied for snap benefits. technically i was suppose to be a full time worker but my bosses lied and last week i only worked 25 hours. i am desperately looking for another job but i live on an island which makes it hard. i applied july 10th, got a call a week later doing the phone interview saying i qualified and then i was sent paperwork to fill out and i sent it in by august first. just got a call today, august 28th saying i do not qualify because i make too much. i i was full time when i applied but even as a full time worker it was minimum wage and i don’t get paid overtime. when i applied online july 10th i told them exactly how much i made so why would they lie and tell me i was accepted? i haven’t bought food in almost two months (been living off canned foods mostly, and bought essentials like milk and eggs). is there anything i can do? i also looked at my application and it said by law i should get an answer about my snap benefits in 30 days, i applied july 10th and got my response today, august 28th. what do i do?"
"my brother is 28. if he filled out his snap benefit as a renter and he is renting at my parents house, it’s illegal for him to share with them, is that right? located in virginia. he’s having an issue bc he refilled the application as you do every month and he says he misunderstood a question and now they think he could be lying. but at the same time, my parents are also benefiting from the benefits. but idk how the rules work. if they find out about my parents what happens? a lot of my dads income is going to his copay for cancer but when they applied they were making too much for snap.

sorry if the answer to this is obvious and i don’t know it. please be gentle with me. they’re just trying to stay afloat and possibly messed up in the process."
"benefits canceled without warning (in mi) tldr version - benefits disappeared without warning, representatives only say ""we're behind"" when i call them. i've been without benefits for well over a month

so i'm in mi and have been receiving food stamps for some time. i had my 6 month review, then received a letter stating that i needed to send in proofs of self-employment income. the problem is, i don't have self-employment income. i did, however, over 8 years ago. i have talked to representatives numerous times about the fact that my account still shows that i'm still self employed and have tried to remove it from the website myself, to no avail. so i went on the mibridges website, and tried removing it again, stating again that i haven't had self employment income for years. i also changed jobs at the same time so i reported that as well. i did this well within the timeframe on the notice. this was back in october.

fast forward to november and the date that my card gets filled comes and goes and it's not being refilled. so i hop on mibridges again and my food benefits are just completely gone. so i called the number, spoke to someone, and she told me she'd get it taken care of the next day. 

2 weeks went by and still nothing. so i called again. it's been over a month by this time, thanksgiving had come and gone and i had nothing for november. the person i spoke to this time would not tell me anything other than they're behind. i asked why they were canceled, why i never even received a cancellation notice, how much longer it was going to be as it's already been a month and she would tell me nothing except ""we're behind and doing our best"". food stamp applications aren't supposed to take longer than 30 days. that's after the initial application, for me this is just a renewal, i don't know why it's taking so long and they will tell me nothing. 

to add, i'm in the up in mi in a small area and we don't have a local office anymore, haven't for years. you call downstate and talk to whoever answers the phone. so i don't have an actual caseworker. 

it's now december and i had to apply for state emergency relief for heat and electricity. i'm guessing they're gonna have a huge influx of people applying for ser because they're cutting off people's food stamps with no warning at all and have no answers when you call them. which is just gonna make more work for them. rinse and repeat

anyhoo i'm rambling now. does anyone have any advice or is anyone else experiencing this? this is the worst possible time for this, it's almost christmas."
"psa: pa snap recipients (early distribution) pa was informed yesterday that to prevent snap distribution delays due to a potential government shut down. pa will disperse all regular and covid-19 payments prior to december 11th. this is not an extra amount, or a christmas gift. this is your normal december allotment, however will be distributed early. 

this is all we were informed about, i do not know if there is or even will be a govt shut down, this is purely a pre-emptive move (remember last year when we had the shut down and benefits just came early)."
question hi!does anyone knows what this means?thank you!
"[nc] questions about snap for separate households at the same address. i have a couple of scenarios that i've been curious about for a while now. if you have multiple families (related) living together at the same address, can they each receive snap if:

1. they are separate households and so pay rent and costs separately?
2. they are separate households and so pay rent separately but pool money together for food?

"college phe waiver expiration? sc hi there,

a couple of months ago i was approved for snap under the efc=0 waiver as a college student and i am wondering what will happen when it comes time to recertify. unfortunately i don't think i would qualify under the non-covid guidelines mainly since i am not working 20hrs/week.

from how i understand it (based on [this memo](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/end-of-temporary-student-exemptions-caa)), the covid phe expires may 11, which means any recertification until june 30 will still qualify for the efc=0 waiver. is this the right math? then benefits would continue for either 6 months to 1 year after that recertification?

this is all a little confusing so i appreciate any guidance!"
"university student with efc of 0, but assets higher than 5k . will i quality ? im from texas, should i do the snap application online, phone or in person to increase my odds of receiving benefits. doing it online has me confused on some of the technicalities. for reference, i'm a part time university student (11hours) , over 22 , live with family and have an efc of 0. my question is, when asked about ""money coming into the home"" do i include my nsf grant payment for doing an reu at a university ? is that even considered ""employment"" if its done for research purposes. additionally, for assets, my liquid assets are over 5k, but its less if i deduct pell grant refunds & even less so if i consider the nsf grant. additionally, do i have to list everyone in my household? if in theory i'm my own economic household, since i need to pay for schooling, transportation, & food myself.

"question about my recertification hi all, i have my recertification interview coming up and i got my paperwork in the mail today. while i was filling it out i noticed under expenses they put cola…i know that that’s the cost of living increase, but why would that be considered a monthly expense? is that an error? if it is how do i correct it on the paperwork? and if it isn’t an error can someone try and explain to me why that’s listed as a monthly expense? 

thanks in advance!"
"florida food stamps | would we still qualify? my reapply date to “not have a lapse in benefits” was august 15th. i didn’t reapply until august 16th. they waited 31 days and said that i needed to upload my lease. i did that 12 days ago, have called twice and had my case escalated twice. they promised an answer by yesterday at closing. still nothing. we were certified for medicaid again 18 days ago, but food assistance has just been stuck in processing. is there anything that i can do? we were affected by hurricane idalia and everyone else had an early issuance, but our promise of having our application processed in 30 days has turned into 45 days.

i live in florida, i am married and have 4 children. right now we receive about $350 in food stamps and all qualify for medicaid. we own our home and pay about $750 in mortgage, $1300 a year in property tax and $2400 a year in home owners insurance. my husband’s job offered him a position in another city that would require us to move and rent. the rent in the particular city runs about $2400 for the kind of home we live in now. we could get about $2000 in rental income for the house we live in now. my question is would we still qualify for food stamps if we rented out our home and rented somewhere else? or would we be required to sell our house which isn’t an option because we would like to move back home one day."
"snap benefits fraud in the spring of 2022 two investigators came to my door. they showed me their badges and were very mean. telling me i’m under investigation for fraud. this has been way over a year now and i haven’t heard anything. my girls and i were cut off from receiving food stamps. 

however last week i received an application for food stamps in the mail. i haven’t filled it out because i’m terrified. does this mean the case against me is closed? how will i know if the case is closed or what the findings are? i haven’t heard a word all this time."

"electronic theft claim denied by the state (la resident). guess i am boned out of $635... | snap benefits stolen from all the way in ny, i live in los angeles, what do i do? hello everyone, last week my ebt card was robbed of $635 from a random address in new york. after spending time to get a claim report and file a ebt 2259 form. according to the mail, "" a system error did not happen when using your electronic  
calfresh benefit account.""

its past 10 days since the theft has occurred and i can no longer try again to receive the funds back. i have seen some posters here be in a similar situation and have gotten their funds, so i presume i must've filled out the ebt form incorrectly, or i am just very unlucky. either way, this is extremely frustrating and now i am paranoid of using my card anywhere now that skimmers seem to be rampant.

anyone else in a similar boat?

hi everyone, terrible thing just happened to me. went to walmart to buy some groceries and when i went to pay at the checkout i only had 46 cents in my account. thought it was very strange and when i checked my transaction history someone spent 635 dollars in some random bodega in new york.

unfortunately, seems like someone somehow got my card information and used my card to buy random crap. i am not sure if credit card skimmers can impact ebt cards or if one of my online accounts was compromised.

at the moment, i changed my pin of my current card and am changing the passwords of all my online accounts. anyone know if its possible to report this fraud? will i be reimbursed?

"nyc active snap case, no deposit on 9/1 my snap case says active on my hra account. i received my last monthly amount on 8/1 so i was expecting to receive ebt today. nothing. i’m freaking out. there’s a deposit schedule online that lists dates by the last digit of your case. mine is 9j? apparently if it’s 9, i’ll be getting it sept 14. this is so stressful and infuriating."
"a state that doesn't require child support to recieve food stamps? so i'm currently in michigan and tried applying for food stamps for myself and my 3 year old. unfortunately when i received the phone call from dhs they told me how my child's father would be forced to pay child support in order to recieve food stamps. i didn't know that was a thing. i had food stamps back in illinois without running into this issue and i'm honestly considering searching for a new state that doesn't force this crap. i told my child's father just in case they opened a case after i already told them not to, and he yelled at me and said if there's ever one opened he'll basically verbally take it out on me like he does with freaking anything that he assumes is my fault. long story short, he's a very angry and hostile guy and i'm just trying to separate myself from him and don't want anything connected to him at all. especially financially. 

what states don't force it?"

"for those who have been waiting a long time for texas snap benefits: read. we renewed in may. escalated july 1. no interview. case not even processed. many are in the same boat. many renewed earlier than may, and are facing the same issues. this is what i did to escalate it beyond the regular escalation. like a couple on this sub already suggested, call the texas ombudsman. i called them, and they said they would get it up to “regional” for us to get an interview. now i wait for that interview. i believe if you do this, you’ll be helped faster. that said, if thousands of people see this, and do the same thing, well, just think it through. give them a call if you have been waiting months."

"investigator i had a welfare investigator show up at my house several months ago and informed me he was investigating for welfare fraud based on the composition of my house. my ex and i used to live together and now we co-parent. beforehand, i never received any letter whatsoever in regards to this. i do know the guy is legit as he gave me his business card and i followed up. when i went to renew for snap a few months later, they denied me because of not having all my stuff turned in on time which i did. when i called, the rep said their supervisor was looking over my case because of a previous investigator visit. 

anyways…i never heard anything again and i had no issues renewing my medical assistance. has anyone ever dealt with this process before?"

"required to apply for 20 jobs in the next 10 days even though i quit because of my disability [kansas] | how long should i wait to receive my ebt card before i should be worried? [ks] in december, i finally reached a point where i realized i couldn't work anymore because of my disabilities, and left my job of 2 years. in january, a friend helped me with applying for ssdi, food assistance, and medicaid. yesterday i got a call from dcf to do my phone interview, and the worker said that i would need to fill out a job contacts form; from what i can see, it looks like it's asking me to apply for 20 jobs and write the contact information for all of them, and then turn in the form to dcf by 02/20/2023. i can try to apply for jobs, but that seems irresponsible knowing that i will be unable to work if i receive an offer. if i knew i could work, i would just go back to my previous job. i asked the worker if it was absolutely necessary for me to fill out the job contacts form in order to receive assistance, and she didn't give me a straight answer. is there a specific way i should phrase this concern? should i try again with a different worker?

&#x200b;

update 02/17/2023:  what ended up working was uploading the confirmation that i had applied for ssdi to the dcf online portal and then waiting on hold (yesterday 02/16/23 it took 6 hours and 19 minutes starting at 8:00 am, in case anyone from ks is curious about the hold time to talk to a case worker) to explain that i had applied for disability benefits and i couldn't work at this time, so i wouldn't be able to turn in the job contacts form by/on 02/20/2023. the case worker was able to remove the job contacts form requirement and have my case approved! they suggested that i look into applying for vocational rehab but they didn't require that i do that or that i get a form from my doctor. 

i was approved for snap benefits over a month ago on february 16th, and i have received my approval letter but i have not yet received my ebt card in the mail (i have never had an ebt card before and i told this to the case worker during the call, and they said they would send one out for me). how long does it take to receive? should i be worried that something has gone wrong?"
"sort of a stretch, but would i be eligible for snap benefits? ohio i am currently living with my wife (both 22 years old). i am starting graduate school after memorial day and my wife is starting work in early june. her income is $81k a year, i will be taking out educational loans and will be getting about 35k/year for non-tuition related expenses (like housing). 

i am asking because i received an email about my efc being 0 and how that may qualify me for ebt benefits. the email was sent by the us department of education.

my issue is i don't think i will be eligible because of my wife's income and i also have a fair amount of assets and savings (roughly $45k and no current debt) however i am curious if i am still eligible because of the efc being 0"

"3 months and counting hey everyone. i've been receiving benefits since last august or september, can't recall exactly when right now. december 28, 2022 i submitted a change report adding my 5 year old to the case since he moved back in with me. that change report still hasn't even been reviewed. i've called support line twice and they've supposedly escalated it but that was over a month ago, now. our finances are tight right now and i desperately need additional benefits for my 5 year old. i guess my question is; is this ""normal"" right now? is the backlog bad enough to justify it taking three months to review a change report? what can i do at this point to get the ball rolling? my son eats like a teenager and it's hard to keep healthy food in the house without enough benefits to feed everyone."
"would i be eligible for food stamps, ft college student, off campus?

if it helps, we live in the state of massachusetts as well."
technical question technical verification what does it mean for florida ebt my renewal for my food stamps was in october. nothing had changed. i renewed online in time even before the date set which was october 15th. i renewed on the 7th and when i renewed it shows under verification needed it shows no verifications needed but at the bottom it says verification needed verification needed to cross the board. when i click on to the benefits summary it says verification needed technical question technical verification. and i'm eligible but my food stamps did not come on for november and it says i need no documents to verify. nothing to be sent in. so why didn't i get approved? what's going on i need my ebt and getting on the phone with them is virtually  impossible. all you do is get switched from pressing one to press two to press 6 it keeps send you through the system and it says phone calls are not being accepted at this time i can't get a hold of anybody i've had complaints to the state up in tallahassee i've had complaints to the complaint board and nobody is answering me.
questions about foods i'm able to purchase so i've been struggling very bad lately to even pay my rent and have neglected my utility bills due to lack of funds. that being said i have no electricity or gas to cook with. so my question is what types of premade food items i'm able to purchase from my local grocery store(meijers)? can i purchase the premade sandwhiches/sushi/salads as long as any of it is not heated or are those off limits? basically just wondering what types of premade food i can get that requires zero cooking so i don't look like an idiot in the grocery line and not be able to pay for my food. also the state i live in is michigan if that makes a difference for anything.
"why are we still receiving emergency allotments? it seems wild that we’re still getting money for covid concerns 2 years after the outbreak.

"texas snap giving extra deposits? is this fraud? opened the your texas benefits app just now. i already received my deposits for january around the 10th.  but apparently there were two additional deposits made january 27th , amounting to over $800??? my monthly amount is $131 for myself and my child, plus the extra allotment deposit. 

i tried calling 211 but no matter how long i listened and pressed numbers and listened some more, i was eventually sent back to the original options and couldn't get a live person. i don't even want to use my card now just in case this was either an error or some kind of fraud (is that possible?) . 

i know last year i had benefits stolen all the way in pennsylvania or something, and it was roughly $400 (wasn't working then), and when i reported it i was denied getting them back. i asked to appeal but never got the paper work. 

has anyone else in texas experienced this? getting extra deposits or way more than you're supposed to? what did you do? i mean yeah it's nice because groceries are very expensive right now, but i also don't need that much in food stamps nor does it feel right when others need it and it could very well be someone else's deposit. i don't want to steal benefits from the state or anyone else.

"when did ""expedited"" stop meaning anything? i applied on feb 1st for fl ebt, and was told by the system my case would be expedited. was able to complete my interview the same day, and again told by my interviewer that the case would be expedited. generally, when that's happened in the past i received my benefits the same night, or the next night at the most. i've been waiting 20 days for my application to stop ""pending"", and my benefits to be deposited. seven days is supposed to be the max for expedited cases.

tomorrow will be the third week in a row i've called the office on wednesday to find out what is taking so long, only to be told ""we're running behind"". i have run out of peanut butter. i'd been eating it by the spoonful since i ran out of bread 2 weeks ago. i have one cup of rice, and one package of ramen left in my pantry, and haven't seen a vegetable since christmas.

people don't get approved for expedited benefits without good reason. that's what they do for people who are genuinely in a food emergency. so whether or not they are ""behind"" why aren't the expedited applications getting approved? "
help still haven’t received the extra benefits for this month and when i try to call it’s always busy or i don’t receive a phone call back. does anyone have any info about when the extra benefits should be available ? i’m in california btw

"nyc snap application keeps asking for documentation | nyc: what is the current eligibility for college students? i don't know if i've been doing something wrong. i submitted my snap application early last month and already did my interview. i submitted documentation before the deadline but was told a week later to submit a couple more along with the initial ones. i also sent them before the deadline i was given. two days ago, i was asked to send the same documents for a third time with a new deadline. is this normal?

i'm currently a low-income (efc = $0) college student who currently does work study. i would like to know if the end of the federal emergency allocations still makes me qualified where i live. 

i was recently denied snap because they only said i was an ineligible student (unsure where though). i provided my college transcript, a letter from public housing, and my birth certificate. did my interview on time. might have been because i was still waiting to do work study at the time. oddly enough, i was issued 3 months of snap solely from federal emergency assistance before it ended. 

i re-applied a few days after my denial because i began doing work-study. i uploaded a copy of my first pay stub and did another interview. i called the hra infoline to see if my eligibility would change with the new document. but they informed me that my second application was already denied because i have an active case. this decision hasn't appeared on my account yet though. i think it's because i assumed that the initial decision meant that my case was closed (took another week for that to occur). the infoline recommended that i should either file a case hearing, apply again, or visit my designated center to discuss with a case worker to see what they specifically want. i was told to bring every document i have just in case.

i help with expenses as much as i can. sometimes i do pay for groceries. i don't pay the water/gas/electricity bill, but i do pay for internet and all of our cellphone bills which is actually more than w/g/e. i know the essential utilities are what they care about. technically speaking, i could pay for the essential utilities instead, but that's just the arrangement we made cus it was more convenient.

i have been filing my taxes separately ever since i turned 18. i also receive medicaid.

if i have to report my parent's income as well, i don't think i would be eligible. they don't make a whole lot of money. only my mom works, but i think combined, we would be just outside of the income threshold.

"food stamps for february to be paid on january 20th | why some restaurants take food stamps per reporting [by cnn](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/08/politics/food-stamps-government-shutdown/index.html), food stamps benefits for february will be paid on january 20th, because the usda found a loophole that allows them to make all the february payments. they had initially said they could only pay 64% of february's food stamps benefit obligations should the shutdown continue into february. 

""the agency initially guaranteed funding for the program, which serves more than 38 million people, only until the end of january if the partial government shutdown isn't resolved sooner.

the department says it is now using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse, and is working with states to issue february's food stamp benefits -- which are expected to total $4.8 billion -- by january 20.""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

there is a common misconception out there that food stamp benefits can be used at restaurants. there is a program called the restaurant meals program that allows eligible elderly, disabled and homeless individuals to use their food stamps ebt cards at approved restaurants, including some fast food restaurants. the program has been around since 1977.   


however, states have to opt into this program and so far, only four states participate in the program - california, arizona, rhode island, and florida. and even within these states, not all run the program statewide. for more on this, [see this article](https://foodstampsnow.com/why-some-restaurants-take-food-stamps/).

"implications of returning to school | comprehensive list of states that do and do not count assets when determining snap eligibility? hello everyone,

i'm in kentucky, but may move to another state for school.

thank you!

hi everyone, 

it is hard to find good information on this. most articles and other sources quote the federal guidelines which make it seem like assets are counted when determining eligibility. however, it seems many states waive the asset test. is there a good source that definitively lists and updates which states do and do not? some people provided links to such a source in older reddit posts, but they are no defunct.

we're in new mexico. thanks.

i just did curbside pickup for the first time with a store i had  not used for curbside before. i had created an online account for rewards and had a $10 off coupon for using curbside. so last night i placed the order for pickup this afternoon. the website said they took ebt for online orders. got to the checkout page and had two options: pay with debit or credit card, or pay in store with ebt. i got some amazing deals so i decided to go through with it and see how it played out. i selected ""pay with ebt"" and then placed the order.

the website says i have to go in to pay, the app let me check in and said someone would come out. so i park in a designated spot and call the number on the sign. i wait about 10 minutes to get transferred to the right people, and explain this is the first time i have done this, i need to pay with ebt, do i come in somewhere? the lady says no i can do it over the phone, then asks me for my card and pin number. i tell her i'm okay with doing the card number over the phone but not so much the pin. and as i'm saying this i feel guilty like i'm accusing her of possible wrongdoing but for obvious reasons this just feels wrong. i ask if there is somewhere i can come in and do the transaction myself. she says no. so i give her the card and pin number (and changed the pin the second i got home). she says this is how they do it, and they write down the card and pin and after they use it they throw away the piece of paper ""in multiple trash cans."" sounds like a safe system, right? what could possibly go wrong?

to top it off, as i'm waiting for my order after getting off the phone from giving the girl my card and pin number, i log into the ebt website and see the charge is $13  (approximately) more than what the online total was on my receipt. so when the order comes out, i ask the girl and she looks at me and says ""i don't know, i just work here."" a second girl (the one i apparently talked to on the phone who took my info) comes over and says ""you're the second person this has happened to. i don't know why it's doing that. call tomorrow and talk to our manager and he will take care of it for you."" so i appreciate their honesty and after looking over the receipt and the order again i feel the receipt is right and the problem was somewhere with the website because some of the prices didn't make sense and i thought it should have been more and i figured that part out.

but what would you do about the whole ""give us your card and pin number"" over the phone situation? this is a major grocery store chain, not a little mom and pop operation. and so it can't just be there store that does this like this.

what is the process on this form? i had to get one because my husband is disabled from a stroke and he has an ssdi claim in the works. he is obviously exempt from working, pending his claim. i took it to his pcp's office and it had a question about mental health so she rejected it, saying it had to be signed by his psychiatrist. the form clearly said any doctor (or even a representative of the doctor's office) could sign it. as his pcp she has all his medical records from all his various specialists. i took it to the psychiatrist's office and they signed it. but if they ask for records from that office it isn't going to back up his ssdi claim, because the bulk of it is medical. wondering if that's going to turn into an issue dealing with the pcp later on.

i have been trying for months to get our case closed in the state we moved from. i finally was able to get them to send me a letter reflecting that which arrived a few days ago. we had snap and our daughter had medicaid. the closing date on snap was backdated so it shows as already closed, but for our daughter's medicaid it says it will end on 5/1. which is kind of infuriating as i didn't renew it and it should have ended 3/31 but they automatically renewed her until september, and then changed it to 5/1 when i spoke with them last week. based on not having any income currently and limited funds, i thought when i applied for snap here we would be expedited, but now i'm actually wondering if the date of 5/1 on this letter will keep us from being able to get snap here for another month. anyone have any insight on how this works? we are now in new mexico."

"question about cash income pa | (pa) snap and homelessness hi people i have a question about cash based income and the snap/medicaid application renewal for my brother. 

my brother is doing some classes and living with a relative (rent $475) and working an under the table job (so cash). it's common where he lives i think, dilapidated area. it's the only job he could get for the time being. it's paying him between $900-$1100 a month. better than nothing at all, he'd probably be homeless without it. our family is real shitty. i don't live anywhere near him and don't have money either so can't help him financially. he lives in pa and i live in ohio. he has about $1100 total cash saved.

his public assistance was setup by a church based services group last year. he didn't do it himself. they did the paperwork for him but they're gone (ended their assistance program i guess) now so they can't help him again with it.

when renewing his application for snap/medicaid how does he report the cash income? a letter signed by the guy paying him? i'm not even sure the guy paying him will be willing to do that to be honest. the snap/medicaid helps him a lot, without it he would barely have any money after paying rent and his other bills. thanks for your help.

question does snap care if you are homeless or living in your car etc? housing expense would technically be zero dollars then i guess. would that screw me over? but obviously a much worse situation. i am almost homeless. probably going to get kicked out of where i'm living in the next few weeks, maybe next week. don't have a lease, not a real tenant, basically a guest in a house. i have paid rent though since 2021. landlord is very unwell (dementia mid stage i think) and is moody/hostile. accuses me of crazy stuff, can't remember anything etc. daughter is not around to take care of her. i'm a good tenant actually.

i was meant to move out a few months ago, but the new place i was supposed to be approved for put me on hold for dumb technical paperwork reasons then they didn't get back to me and went dark and ghosted me. i didn't expect that to happen. i didn't have a backup plan. for the last few months i've been paying my landlord triple so she won't kick me out but my car broke down majorly (transmission and other related stuff) which i had to fix in order to have transport to work. too far for a bus route. but that cost literally every penny of my savings so i'm out of money now. it was a huge bill.

the waitlist for public housing is at least 9 months i'm told and section 8 is totally closed. i'm in real trouble now. i don't have any family to go to for help sadly."

"extra covid allotment didn’t deposit - alabama since we’ve been approved, we get two deposits a month: one on the regular deposit day for the amount we qualify for and a second deposit on the 31st for the remaining amount to bring us up to the the household maximum. for some reason, the second deposit didn’t happen today. i asked my case worker and she didn’t have a clue, she said all that comes from montgomery. did anyone in alabama get their second deposit today or if not, do you know why we didn’t? as far as i can tell, the maximum benefits being awarded was continued through sept 2021, so i don’t think it was stopped. i’m worried there was an issue with our recertification and my case worker is being very confusing/slow about everything, so i’m worried it’s not coming. i was really planning on that today."
"do i qualify? i am 22, located in nevada & have been unemployed since 2020 due to some mental health issues. i live with my mom & she’s applying for food stamps and encouraging me to apply separately from her. we do prepare our meals separately. i don’t think i qualify for benefits. is is better for me to apply alone? 

i fell super nervous about getting an appointment because i know the people who work in the office can be very unkind."

"request for bank statements from alameda county california hi there, i am in alameda county in california. i was enrolled in graduate school full time for the past 3 years. during that time, my family (2 adults, 3 children) received snap benefits. i graduated and started my first job in october and we reported the new income and our benefits ended (which was expected).

however, last week we received a letter stating that the state can match “income, lump sum payments, resources or interest and dividend payments of all welfare recipients” and is requesting bank statements or authorization for the state to access the information on that account for the year 2020 on a few savings accounts we have at a bank that is not our every day bank. the letter indicates we did not report these accounts on our application. i have no recollection of being asked to report accounts on our application but i guess it’s possible i forgot to report them. all we use them for is saving for long term/emergency situations and, until the money was gone, funds saved for my tuition. we don’t receive income there other than a few cents or a couple of dollars worth of interest sometimes (depending on rate and balance in account.)

all that to say, i am uncomfortable with the request and don’t understand why it is being requested. the letter is unclear. is it suggesting the system thinks we were receiving unreported income into these accounts? am i wrong in my understanding that california does not count savings when assessing eligibility for snap? we definitely held onto funds through my graduate school program in order to pay tuition but we always qualified for snap from an income perspective. 

i have left multiple messages for the individual who sent the letter but they have not responded yet to my request for clarity on what the letter is asking for. i feel really anxious about it or that we somehow misunderstood our eligibility and could be assessed as ineligible for benefits we were given more than 2 years ago. 

thanks in advance!"
help! i recently got approved into the calfresh program. i 20f am a college student who pays rent (1287 a month) and some tuition out of pocket. i do get financial aid but i still pay over 10k a year. i am not a dependent and my paychecks are only about $800 every two weeks as i work part time. i was expecting it to be a huge help as i have some friends who get 200-250 a month. however i found out i will only get $14 a month? does anyone know why the amount is absurdly low? i am already already facing food insecurity and i thought i would get more.
question about p-ebt 3.0? does anyone know when they will be/ were mailed out?
"confusion with foodstamps i am a bit confused with my food stamps situation. basically, i just moved out and i’m currently attending a university and do a work study. my mom gets food stamps and she was claiming me on her food stamps but now that i have the work study, i’m trying to get my own since i live so far away and i can’t use hers. however, once i put in my application the food stamps website said i had already received food assistance for the month even though i haven’t. i don’t know if it makes a difference but i live in florida."
"oh, student exemption changes. reapplication fell before july 30th. long story short i submitted my ebt reapplication/recertication in oh as a student prior to june 30th rule changes but processing of documents did not occur until after june 30th at which point they requested student exemption documentation. according to the gov website if i applied before the rule change i should not need an exemption. they will likely refuse assistance now, what are my odds with an appeal?  

a 20 hr work schedule is not feasible given my current academic schedule as a medical student, i am maxed out on loans."
"phone not working? yeah, just wondering if anyone has been able to get a hold of anyone on the phone (nyc). they removed the call back option as of maybe 2 weeks ago.

i called today literally at 8:33am, 3 minutes after they opened and have been on hold for now 30 minutes and counting. i submitted all documents and have completed my interview. i applied for emergency cash assistance/fs august 10th and a few days ago received a request to upload documents or my case will be denied. i’m confused, and by time i get out of work i’ll be sitting in an office for more than 2 hours. last time there wasn’t even a seat to sit down. is there another way to get this processed? this is becoming so stressful just for a little help 😞"
"can i use food stamps in other states? i travel for work, never staying in the same place for more than a month at a time. i lived in ohio for most of my life and that’s where all my family is. could i apply to get snap in ohio and then use my card all around the us? my employer is not based in ohio and i do not live there anymore. so i’m wondering..how might i go about getting and using food stamps while i travel?"
"tx snap: no decision after 30 days laid off in march and applied asap. it's been over 30 days with no decision,  i've submitted all required docs.

ebt scam: check the machine where you swipe your card before you swipe it. there are thousands and thousands of stolen info my information was stolen at a store and i don't know where. i was told that some people install something on the machine where you swipe so they can steal the numbers and the pin and then wipe out your funds. i'm writing this because i lost all my funds and ny state will not give it back. hra will not help. all the victims of this fraud were just left without money that's all
"never got called for interview i recently applied for ebt (in ma if that matters) and my phone interview was supposed to be yesterday (the 22nd) 
i kept a close eye on my phone as to not miss the call, but i never got one. not at my scheduled time, any time after that nor did i get reached out too as to why or about a reschedule
i'm not sure what i should do moving forward, do i need to call them to reschedule or reapply all together? or should i just wait until i hear back from them?"
"ebt saying i make more than i do? i was given my determination today, i bring home 800-1,000 a month. ebt determination said i bring home 1,240 a month. i sent 3 stubs and get paid twice a month, each stub didn't go over a grand when added with another stub. i'm only receiving $64 in ebt, is this correct or what should i do about it? ontop of rent i can barely afford food."
"(nyc/general): snap budgeting/food insecurity master's thesis research hello!

i'm a journalism master's student compiling a thesis on snap/p-ebt/ebt in the context of food insecurity in new york city. i'm looking to speak with anyone who has used the program at any point over the past couple of years (ideally i'll speak with people who used it prior to covid and those who applied after covid's arrival). i'd love to hear from anyone with intimate experience with the program or knowledge of its operations. i'm looking to better understand the everyday decisions (how accessible is the program, how households choose to use it, do households still look to charitable programs like food banks etc.)

if this is something you're willing to discuss, please reach me by dm and i'll take you through more specifics. right now, i just want to put the call out there to get a better survey of people's experience with the program.

i do want to emphasize something, so apologies for the length: food insecurity is not synonymous with poverty nor is poverty synonymous with food insecurity. one of the most destructive narratives that has emerged since the pandemic is that food insecurity is some kind of new phenomenon in the u.s.  i believe too many stories are written about the mere existence of these realities as if they haven't existed before (this speaks to a broader issue about how media organizations are built and how they cover communities unfamiliar to them). 

what is important to me is how people are adapting in these increasingly challenging times and what role government assistance plays in that. if i can promise you anything, it is that i will listen carefully about your experience with the snap program and how it factors into your everyday life.

if this interests you, please dm me. i think it's important that the public is better aware of how the snap and (p)-ebt programs are designed and how individuals interact with them.

thank you!"

"phone interview scheduled today, received no call but marked denied for not keeping appt??? i applied for snap benefits in georgia maybe 2 weeks ago, since i have been unable to work due to the zombie apocal- i mean, covid-19 outbreak. i haven’t gotten any mail correspondence, but i got a call from the automated system the day before yesterday saying my appointment was at 9:30am on 4/8. i set my alarm for 9 so i’d be alert when the case worker called, but no call came through (i was connected to wifi with a super strong connection and my phone isn’t set to silence unknown callers, i confirmed). at 9:45 there was still no call so i called the automated line and the app status was “denied due to not keeping interview appointment”....what?!!!! i’ve literally been watching my phone, waiting for it to ring...there are no missed calls, what in the world??????  i called back and (by nothing short of a miracle) someone called right back! she said the cw will call within the hour, that my case was not denied, and that she emailed the cw let her kno i was still waiting for her call. she assured me the cw will definitely call by 6. of course i never got a call,  and my app status is still saying “denied for missed appt” on the automated line. i requested several calls back and never received one again, i requested my appointment be rescheduled, the automated system said i’d get a call back that i never got. i actually read an article that a year or two ago, caseworkers in georgia had been accused of denying applicants after falsifying documents, saying the applicant didn’t answer the phone, so they would not have to process the application. i’m positive they are overwhelmed because of our current state, but this is literally what my fear is happening to me. 

i kno it’s a lot to read, and my apologies, i just wanted to be thorough. but if there’s anyone, maybe an existing case worker or someone who has a similar situation they’ve successfully resolved, can anyone offer any insight?? i haven’t worked in 3 weeks, we are very low on food, and i’m panicking 😥

update! ok so, they really never called me back. but i got up at the buttcrack of dawn to hope that if i called the automated line early i may get a call back this time. it worked again! i got a very nice lady who told me she wasn’t sure why the application was denied and that she doesn’t want to assume anything, but she escalated my case and said do not worry - we are in this together! you’ll get a call back to reschedule as soon as this request is process, just relax and wait for the call. she also gave me cw info that i didn’t get before. i hung up with her and the cw called within 30 seconds! he literally asked me 1 question then said my card is in the mail and in 20 min my case status will be updated. so i think my issue is resolved 🤞🏽anyone else that is having a similar issue, call the contact number first thing in the am! when i called at 8-9am, i got an immediate call back...there is an option to reschedule your appt, select it and they will verify your number. someone from the contact center can reach your cw for you. all isn’t lost!!"

snap only for super poor people? my cousin tried to apply for foodstamps recently. she has barely any money and barely any monthly income. and she was approved but only for around $70 or so. better than nothing at all but not much with food prices. it seems like snap expects a person to spend 30% of their income on food and maybe like 50% of their income on housing. is that right? it seems like you only get a large snap allotment if you have basically no money at all. i just thought it would be more generous than that.
"i can't enter the same password to electronically sign the snap recertification as the title says, i was wondering if anyone encounter a similar problem with the password issues upon doing the electronic signature at the end of the snap application/recertification.

i have the mybenefits account connected to my state gov account which allows me to have access to my snap application.  when i reset my password on my gov account, i still can enter into mybenefits portal and start the application.

when i got to the end of the application, i enter the same password as my gov account because it should be the same as mybenefits account. then, i encountered an error,  ""**the password you have entered is incorrect. please try again.** "" i've tried old and new password from the gov account, and nothing worked. i tried resetting it state gov account twice, it doesn't work. there wasn't a way for my to reset the mybenefits account password because it's connected to the other account.

i did read, "" **please enter the password you created when you set up your mybenefits account to electronically sign this application.""** i'm not sure if it refers to the old password. i tried the new password, but it doesn't allow me to submit it. i honestly don't remember it, but i had every old and new password, and it doesn't work. i remembered the link always direct me back to the state account portal to login when i first apply for snap.

"husband and i aren’t together. case worker called my references and one said i live with my husband. possible fraud investigation? i am in tennessee. 

i had my recert today and they asked me for 2 references which i gave. 

some backstory - my husband and i have a rocky relationship. it’s on again off again, but neither one of us can afford a divorce. i’m currently in nursing school full time so i don’t work. right now i bounce between family and friends until nursing school is done. i do, however, continue to use my husbands address for mail.

i’m worried that i’m going to end up going to prison. i was approved but have to put in a document stating why i do not work at my former job (full time nursing school). do i just not submit this and retry again? if this does go forward with a fraud investigation what do i do? i don’t have access to my husbands income and my reference even offered to call back and say she misspoke, but i thought that would just look sketchy. i’m worried this will make it to where i cannot go forward with school. any advice is appreciated."
"calworks relocation assistance (california) i get calworks and i recently got evicted from my apartment (my landlord refused to accept erap payment) so i’m going to rent a spare room at my sister’s house.  she’s nervous about accepting the housing assistance payment to let me move in because dpss wants the name of the homeowner (her landlord) but he’s a bit of a dick and she’s concerned that if dpss contacts him it will cause trouble for her.  she’s been renting the place for over 7 years, the landlord knows that she’s been looking for new roommates to replace ones who moved out a couple years ago and i’m pretty sure that he’s not allowed to discriminate based on source of income but i don’t think she’ll rent the room to me if they involve her landlord.

"ex-husband gave wrong alimony amount during interview this is more of a post to blow frustration but also am wondering how much trouble am in - and if someone has any suggestions.

my ex and i have been divorced for 11 years now.  he's 55+ and has severe breathing issues and is on 3 liters of oxygen and works with a portable oxygen concentrator.  his doctor has warned me he's issues with hypoxia.  

when we got divorced, the alimony agreement was for $400.  in 2020 it changed to $500 and i pay $200 in rent.  i did not get the changes written down.  however i have paid taxes on this amount.  and in past ebt interviews, he's signed papers and verbally told them $500.  today he told the interviewer $400.  i also found out he's been putting $400 on his tax forms.  and when he told me he talked to the interviewer, he was very happy he remembered the $400 amount.

i have already told him that i want a letter from his doctor detailing that he's on oxygen and has issues with hypoxia.  is there any other documentation i should gather?  

the same people who approve me for food stamps do approval for my medicaid.  (i'm in colorado.)   and while it will hurt if i don't get food stamps . . . i will literally die if this messed up my medicaid.  so am in a real-bad freak out over this.  any ideas or tips you can give me?"

my electric bill is in my ex fiancés name because i don’t have the money to put down a security deposit ($432) i have renewed my benefits about 3-4 times since he moved out with his name still on the electricity bill. this month they denied me of food stamps and liheap because his name was on the electricity bill. so i had to send in a renewed lease proving that he wasn’t living with me. my old lease didn’t have his name on it from oct 2021 and  it ended in oct 2022. no biggie. sent in my new lease stating it’s a month to month now for the 2022 year with only my name on it to verify again that he has not been living with me for over 2 years. my rent had increased from $925 to $1200. 

i just got a call from the county assistance office (a fill in from my actual case worker) she questioned me as to why my paychecks only state that i make $500. i told her that i’m a waitress and that’s what it shows that i make. i don’t have another way to prove my income. she then questioned me “how do you pay for you things?” i said “it’s pretty much a struggle every month” she goes “sure it’s a struggle but it doesn’t show or tell me anything” and i said “well, i’m not exactly sure what to tell you” and then she proceeds to ask me “does your child’s dad pay child support?” and i said “no he doesn’t” and then she asks me “why doesn’t he pay child support “ i said “because i never took him to court for child support?????” she tells me that i need to provide my bank statements for the past 2 months and that if i have anyone helping me that i need to let her know.

i am a little irritated because for the past 5 years i have never had any problems with anything of these situations. i am honest and a little dumbfounded by all of this. i’m actually struggling and need help. i wouldn’t be on it if i wasn’t, like i actually need help. what makes me the most irritated is that there are people who have and continue to play the system and they have no problem helping them out. but the ones who actually need help can not receive it or get knocked down…"

my car fmv is 24500. i have done the calculation that i do not pass the asset test. but i do owe a loan, and i owe the bank 35500 on the loan. does it count if i subtract what was owed on loan from what the fmv is and leave it as a negative number? or do they not care what i owe on it? basically, i need the money to survive to feed myself and the two girls until i find a job. i was in the process of applying, but i am scared i will be denied and can't submit for six months again. to be honest, if i don't find a job in one month and pay my expenses, i will need to move out of my apt, voluntarily repossess the car, and move with a family member until i get back on my feet. i feel like going through pandemic days again. uuugh. i need some guidance if i should go ahead in apply or wait until i no longer have a car (sadly)."

"the hr department at my previous job is being absurd and unhelpful with my 631 form. let me first clarify that these are not my food stamps. my dad is unemployed due to disability, which leaves me as the sole wage earner in the household. about a month ago, i left my job due to the intense suicidal thoughts i began to have due to working there, and now i need a 631 form filled out so that my dad can continue to get food stamps to feed my family.

the hr rep that i went to about the form told me that she couldn't fill out the form because my employment was terminated. she directed me to a third party company to get it taken care of.

this third party company not only has an absurd number of hoops to jump through, but also has incorrect  information on my file, and also shows record of continuous unsuccessful attempts by the utah dws to access my information.

earlier today, i called the hr rep again and explained to her that the third party company was unhelpful and that i needed her assistance to get the form taken care of somehow.

she spewed some excuses about how other employees in the past hadn't had any issues with it and basically told me that she didn't care and didn't have any help to offer.

the next thing i did was call her boss and explain the same thing to him. i was more than a little frustrated and i let him know (still in a reasonably professional demeanor) that the way he is handling this is completely unacceptable and that i expect him to do the bare minimum and just sign the form to confirm that my employment there had ended.

from here the conversation degraded:

me: look, i need this form signed to confirm that i don't work there anymore.

&#x200b;

him: i can't do that; you don't work here anymore.

&#x200b;

me: i know i don't work there anymore, that's why i need you to sign this form that *says* i don't work there anymore.

&#x200b;

him: i'm not authorized to do that because you don't work here anymore.

&#x200b;

me: okay, can you help me get to someone who is authorized to sign this form?

&#x200b;

him: look, i've already told you there's nothing i can do. you need to go through \[third party company\] to get the form filled out.

&#x200b;

me: i've called them a dozen times. they have incorrect information and are unable to give me any sort of definitive answer about how they can help me with the form.

&#x200b;

it was here that he quit even trying to give relevant answers. instead, he kept repeating the bullshit about the third party company, and after i started to get more frustrated, he began to give me flack for not putting in two weeks before quitting.

literally any time i tried to steer the conversation back to the topic of him simply helping me get access to somebody who could sign the form, he kept saying ""you didn't even finish 2 weeks!""

i essentially snapped at this point and pretty much yelled:

&#x200b;

""you know what \[hr rep\]? i wanted to put in 2 weeks but i can guarantee you that i'd have put a bullet between my eyes before those weeks were up! so thanks, \[hr rep\]! i really appreciate how apathetic and unhelpful you've been, and i admire how you refuse to take any fucking responsibility! you really give a sense of professionalism to your workplace! fuck you \[hr rep\]! i hope you sleep well while my family starves because of the shitty job i quit!""

&#x200b;

i'm pretty sure he hung up at some point during this rant but i was too angry at the time, so i don't really remember. as soon as i finished i broke down crying and had to collect myself so i could get ready for my shift (which i was conveniently an hour late to).

&#x200b;

fuck kroger. fuck smith's. maybe this isn't the right place to ask, but if anyone here has experience dealing with this type of thing, i'd appreciate any help you can give. i'm literally just so done with this."

"how to properly update information for benefits? illinois i just had a baby in april and i moved out of my family home that i was living in when i applied for benefits. i don't pay rent because it's another family owned property but it's an apartment, my boyfriend lives with me and he handles utilities since he still works. i'm currently on maternity leave making 0 income. i want to apply for wic along with my food stamps but i'm not sure how to update my information so that i'm not losing benefits.

when i originally applied for snap, i wasn't paying rent either so my allotted monthly amount was really low. after having my daughter, they upped the amount a lot. if i update things to show that i moved out, will they ask for rent/etc. again and will that change anything? will they ask how i'm affording other bills?"

i am applying for ebt after never having done it. i was always hesitant about it...kind of an ego thing...but i need it now.

question being....benefits.gov says 

""to be eligible for this benefit program, you must be a resident of the state of california and meet one of the following requirements:

you have a current bank balance (savings and checking combined) under $2,001""

but the department of social services site says there is no resource limit  on most househouseholds...and its a measure of current income.

which is it? i do have more than 2 grand in my checking..and am worried i'll get disqualified for that...but there's contradicting info out there...i am currently also on unemployment"

"deposits not showing on benefitscal? i have, for a couple years, maintained a balance on my account, and used about as much as i received; however, for the past 3 months (since there was a lot of drama with tad, and i got renewed and switched to a new area), i noticed my balance was dropping. that's when i started investigating my transaction history and saw these weird entries; also could not find the deposits, which should be $281 or so.

anyone know what this is? what is the 0.00? is that where the $281 should be, and something is wrong with my account? i am currently active until june 2024. the only thing i know to do is now monitor my balance every day and see if it increases by $281 at some point; so far, it hasn't.

update: i had been monitoring it for 9 days, and on 9/9, it finally went up by the appropriate amount, despite no deposit showing. so for anyone coming across this, in the future, the transaction history on calfresh no longer shows deposits... it used to, before they updated their website.

""new status : your application was received and may be scheduled for an interview."" does nj have a work requirement? i'm freelancing and scraping by but my hours are all over the place

so, pretty sure 30 business days have elapsed since nov 21. is it a seasonal slowdown? what is going on? i'm hungry lads. being on hold for ages is doing wonders for the anxiety.

i even emailed the case worker asking for an update, receipt confirmation. no answer. anyone know what's up in hudson county?

i was recently forced to reapply, had a phone interview, was told my case was pending until documents were emailed by deadline, and i met the deadline. haven't heard back so i'm just wondering how long limbo might last. also, does the web portal show when you've been approved? mine simply says submitted, not even ""pending"".

just curious if it's a general issue. i'm in hudson; haven't heard anything since i applied in june. gonna see if i can get a fair hearing by asking on the phone i guess, i really don't have a whole day to waste, especially not in a stuffy office while covid cases are rising.

so i called the county office about my application from june 29th and was transferred to an extension simply rang and rang until i was automatically transferred to some sort of voicemail service. left messages. called again, same operator said that was the only number they had for new applications, reassured me that someone would get back to me before transferring me again. same deal, left more messages lol. nothing mean. 

so, my question is: was the operator telling the truth? can i expect a call? 
calling again will not make a difference, apparently.

i'm praying i can somehow food pantry my ass through this, but fuck what the hell.

eta: no shade to the operator

applied late june, no call yet. is approval without interview a thing?"
"pa- disability and household elligibility snap / ebt question

hello everyone, i have a bit of an odd question and my county office told me to go f**k myself and that they won’t answer any questions, so here i am. i am permanently disabled, and my partner has offered to move in with me and come take care of me full time. she’s a saint for this, but we have a dilemma. she doesn’t qualify for snap because of her age, and if she moves in with me theres two possibilities. a: i lose my food benefit and we starve or b: my food benefit increases because there’s now two people living in the house. i would be the only “income” involved here. 

again, when i called the county they said they would not answer hypotheticals and that if i was trying to “beat the system” i’d lose my benefits, so i cant ask them. 

tldr; would i lose my snap benefits automatically if my partner moved in with me?"
(ga) received my extra benefits this morning. not sure if im posting or flairing this right but i called this morning and had recieved my monthly benefit amount for the second time this month. thought this might be helpful for people who are waiting or for anyone who had already spent their benefits and werent going to check for a refill. health and a full pantry to all of you.

they also told me ""people have been waiting 2-3 months because we're so backed up"" and that the haskell office didn't process my paperwork properly after recertification, so because of their negligence i've been without snap benefits for going on 4 months. i asked for the haskell office number, they said they didn't have one. i asked to speak to a supervisor, they said there wasn't one available.

"[mn] approved 2 months ago, but haven't received my card. any other options? tl;dr: mn ebt customer service won't send me a card, claims they have, but after over 2 months, still haven't gotten any of the four cards that have been issued. please help, i'm tired of angry crying and waiting on hold.

sorry, this is a long one, but i feel like the details are necessary so you guys understand that i've tried everything. i applied for snap for the first time in my life in early november 2021 and was approved on november 15th. the system shows that my first card was issued on the 16th, and the lead time is supposed to be 5-7 business days. i never got the card.

after waiting a couple weeks, on december 1st, i called the ebt customer service line for mn to see what was up. they verified my address multiple times and said i should've gotten it by now, but the mail could be slow. i live in a populous suburb and have been receiving other correspondence from the county/state in the mail within 2-3 days. they said i could either wait a little longer or cancel and re-issue a new card. i waited, but i then decided to call and request a new one on december 3rd. 

december 17th, i called again because i still hadn't received either card. they verified my address again and said that the only option was to wait or cancel and reissue the card again. so i talked to the local post office and they couldn't find any mail that was sent to me from the ebt servicer. i waited another week and called again on the 23rd to have a third card reissued (i found out that each time they do this they've been charging me a $2 fee too btw). so i waited again. 

on january 10th, i still hadn't received any of the three cards they issued. i was fed up and decided to call my county case worker. she tried to be as helpful as she could and checked into some options but due to covid, they won't let me pick up my card at a county office like they apparently used to in these situations. she said my only option was to call and have them reissue a fourth card. called again, asked if there are any options to track the parcel, and even offered to pay for priority mail, but the rep said this wasn't possible. they also said if i have it sent to another address, the mail will just get returned as undeliverable. the rep said that the cards are automatically issued, so it's not like a person is physically sending it to me. so i had them cancel and reissue the card again. 

now it's january 20th 2022, and i still haven't received any of the four cards that have been issued. clearly there's a technical issue or something, but nobody can do anything about it. i have almost $1000 sitting in an account that i can't use, and my savings are pretty much depleted at this point. 

even if you aren't familiar with mn specifically, does anyone have any ideas of who else (other than my county worker, the county office, or the ebt customer service) i can contact to get this figured out?  i tried searching this and other subs but haven't come across anyone in this same situation."

"[ca] can i use my remaining benefits if my calfresh has been discontinued/denied post-recertification? i'm in california and was on calfresh as a university student with a work-study exemption. i waited until the last minute to submit my recertification (9/28; deadline 9/30) because i found out that i wasn't actually being paid via work-study at my job, and after fixing that, i wanted at least one record that my income was coming from work-study employment. i stupidly avoided opening the recertification package i was sent, and i found out that i missed my interview. when i called the county social services office, they told me that i didn't need to reschedule the interview as per pandemic policies. i'm not sure if my calfresh has been discontinued/denied due to the information in my recertification (i also have extra income from some one-time scholarships in addition to the work-study job) or because my recertification hasn't been processed yet. either way, am i still able to use my remaining benefits on my ebt card? thank you!"

was this a mistake? i was recently approved for food stamps. in i believe they made an error. they counted my household as a 2 person household instead of 3. my brother is disabled so he receive a check each month. they didn’t include him in my household. i put him and my mom on the application they the only people that live here. maybe they did that cause he receive ssi? the amount they sent with the ebt card said $516. i’ve been trying to get in contact with my case worker to fix this mistake. my state is nc.

"michigan, macomb county questions | 2 dollar increase, not sure why | michigan food assistance much less than i have been getting for the last decade or so. today is my normal day to get snap on my card. i did the renewal online mid december. when i go to the mibridges site, the request for renewal is still there on the left, but when i click it i get a page not found screen. i just called my caseworker's number, and after 15 minutes of prompts and recorded speech, i think it told me that i was 2 minutes late to talk to anyong. 9am to 3pm?  there's no other letters waiting for me on mibridges, so i'd really like to get in contact soon and fix this. my ssi is still valid, so i assume my snap should be fine.  


is there a better way to get in touch with my caseworker so i can see what's going on? anyone else in michigan missing january snap yet?  system lagging?

most of this year, i was receiving $192 a month here in michigan.  the last two months, it has been $194.  didn't receive any notices, and haven't seen anything about it after a few internet searches.

am i special like my mom told me, or is this happening to others?

tldr: screwed up didnt get reauthorization done in october. got back on in january but monthly total is $140 a month less. income and monthly expenses didn't change.

&#x200b;

have been on food assistance for 9-10 years.  always the max, maybe a few months here and there with less, but always corrected.  approved for ssi 5 years ago, max monthly payment. housing is 450 total, rent and utilities paid in one lump sum. 

anxiety and procrastination made me miss the due date to get paperwork handed in on time last october.  finally got it straightened out through an online application at the end of december.  assistance back on for january, but for only $54 a month, when the last few years it has been $194 or so.  

called my worker, she confirmed the math lined up, and when i asked why my amount is so much lower she kinda avoided the question.  asked again, and she said something about a change to deductions. me paying everything together is causing me to not get all deductions, or something like that.

i guess why i am posting, is to see if anyone else has gone through something like this recently, and did you find a way to fix it.  i'm considering leaving the program, and then going to someone that helps people with the application, but need to check if there's a time limit before i'm able to reapply.  that, or maybe trying to separate my monthly payment in to individual bills i guess."

"2022 cola effect on snap so far, i cannot find a straight answer from anyone i have contacted, or searching the internet.

if you are currently receiving ssi and/or ssdi benefits - and also receive snap benefits, how will the 2022 cola effect your snap allotment amount? if it is calculated by your ss income, which will increase by 5.9% in january, will that therefor lower (or possibly disqualify you from) the amount you receive in snap benefits?

if so, isn't that quite a ""wash"" that ultimately will not be much help for a person of this position?

"fraud case due to domestic violence circumstances i’m in connecticut if that helps. i’ve been in a crappy situation for a while & due to my child’s father abusing me physically and verbally as recently as the beginning of this month , i’m now having to clean up a lot of things. one of them being this food stamp fraud investigation i’m guessing. back in june , my child’s father (who is on my food stamps because i live with him) got a new job. from what he was telling me it was still under our income limit for snap . yes i should’ve asked for proof of his income but if i pushed anything financially it turned into a huge issue. fast forward to october , he spends 4 weeks on workers comp & then gets fired soon upon returning. he was constantly getting written up and leaving before completing jobs . due to all of the violence & me having to move many times with my child , it completely slipped my mind to report the job . that is entirely my fault which i understand. he has a new job now and we’re way under the income limit snap gave us. i reported this job as now dcf is involved in our situation because of him & i am getting back on my feet and back in my right mind , but then got a notice saying they were just now informed he was hired at the previous job. i’m not even sure how much he did make there . he kept it all hidden . i’m not sure what to do now . it’s been over 2 months since he was fired from there. he refused to spend money when necessary so snap was the only way we were eating , but i should’ve been more responsible. do i call them and tell them what happened and see where it goes ? i know i messed up , i know i’ll probably lose my benefits too & i am extremely nervous as that is the only way i can afford groceries right now . i think the offices are closed wednesdays for processing but i can call first thing tomorrow morning , i am just nervous as i know although i was a victim it was still my responsibility. our income was pretty much always below the limit , but if he had gotten paid more than he told me a few times i genuinely had no clue. they just raised the income limit not long ago, i’m just really worried. they haven’t yet reviewed the new job information i submitted or change of address (change of address was super recent) ."

"disability florida my son turned 22 and is on disability with ssi. he will soon convert to dac(disabled adult child). at that time he will lose medicaid because his disability payment will be $1096. there are apparently special rules for dac, and he will be re-applying for medicaid after this happens. right now, he just gets the max ssi. should he apply for food stamps, or wait until the new medicaid application goes through? at $1096 would he get food stamps in florida? i've tried to read about it online but keep getting different info. he has never qualified before but now at 22 he might. he buys his own food and pays rent. with the cost of everything, food stamps would definitely help."
"spelled name wrong on account so i just made a snap benefit account on yourtexasbenefits.com with my name, social security number, address, email, and phone number. it was easy to make but i just realized i somehow added an extra letter to my name and did not notice. i can't find anything online about how to change it and am really worried this will disqualify me from benefits. can i just make a new account or will that also not work because i already have an account made with my social attached? or does anyone know how i could change my name on account?"
"letting someone move in..idaho i am 67. my income is social security of $1107 and i receive $50 mo in foodstamps and i also receive qmb medical assistance.

times are really hard here, and i know of a 21 year old girl, a former foster child, who is really floundering in life. (not my foster child). she only makes about $700 (net) per month at her fast food job, and of course that is not enough to pay rent, buy clothes or anything. she literally has two pairs of pants. she is currently couch surfing and pretty much going from one dangerous situation to the next. she is really trying hard to find another job but our local economy is just in the crapper right now.

i would like to take her in and let her stay in my spare room for no rent, maybe just help out with housework and chores.

i am obviously not going to be able to feed her on my $50 per month foodstamps, she will have to buy her own food and toiletries. but if we put both our incomes together, we would be over the foodstamps limit. she doesn't plan to ask for foodstamps, although i believe she still might have medicaid for being a former foster child. her asthma inhalers are being paid for by medicaid.

is there any way i can do this without losing my foodstamps and qmb? cause i can not afford to cut my own throat to help someone else, but i would really like to help her out.

thank you for any assistance you can provide.

"documentation required: change in household circumstances just received alert to prove proof of shelter expenses and income. 
wondering why?

have traveled for the first time and just did an order for walmart delivery a couple days ago on my ebt card in a different state.

 according to the advice by experts here, under two weeks duration should not have triggered any issues of out of state reporting. 

perhaps that's inaccurate and my single out of state order unfortunately triggered the alert?

or is it because of the periodic report recently i submitted - which i didn't mention changes but perhaps it's a follow up on the report.

thanks"

"p-ebt for my children illinois hello, just seeing if anyone can help me here. i have 3 school aged children and we live in illinois. i do not receive snap anymore so i didn’t think my children would qualify for the p-ebt, but they did get free meals so i suppose it makes sense that they did. except only 2 out of my 3 did. my 12 y/o and my 13 y/o, not my 8 y/o. and i was also wondering if anyone knows why my 12 y/o received more than my 13 y/o? my 13 y/o received $388 and my 12 y/o received $594! would they have put my 12 y/o and 8 y/o together on just 1 card? sorry for posting here, but my local office doesn’t answer the phone and it’s quite a drive from where we live. any insight is helpful! thank you!"

when i lived in massachusetts, with the same wage and wasn’t paying rent (lived w my dad but he wasn’t part of the household), ma ebt gave me $190 a month!

"investigation (pa) i don’t even know where to begin. i’ve been receiving medicaid since dec/jan of 2022. i applied because i was pregnant and needed help with co-pays. my primary insurance comes from my job. i also applied for food stamps but got denied but they told me i can try again when i got on maternity leave since i’ll be on std. fast forward to july (gave birth in june) and i applied for snap and got approved for $135 starting sept but were giving me $211 to cover july and august . i didn’t use the benefits until late august after going in person to get a ebt card since they never sent one. i spent the $211.  

now i get a call from an investigator (osig)earlier this month saying that he stopped by my place to talk but no one was around and then told me i was being investigated. my caseworker wanted to verify if my newborn’s father was living with me. we’re together but not on the best of terms. i told the investigator he comes and goes, which is true. i asked him if i needed to add him on my case even though he’s not always here and he said not necessarily. long story short, he asked me for a copy of my lease (they had my old one, i upgraded to a two bedroom in april to prepare for the baby’s arrival) and his id. i send them both. my son’s father is not on the lease. address on the id is different but it’s expired. boyfriend has not updated his information in the past year. he stays with family and friends because he is a independent contractor and travels for work. there was a period of time where he was working for someone and i allowed him to use my address. i told the investigator that he also pays my rent to help me since i’m literally on my own but i messed up and didn’t report that. i didn’t think that was income because i wasn’t “seeing” the money since it would go straight to paying rent and i can prove that with my bank statements. i have no friends and family here. i also told the investigator that when the baby was born he stood with me for two months to help me out. investigator said he understood and he wasn’t going to report thatbut i don’t believe him. he asked me if my bf gets any mail, i said just one credit card statement but that’s it. and that was the end of the call. 

he called back to ask about my bf’s id i said i know he hasn’t renewed it because he had tickets he needed to take care of and the investigator named a couple of addresses my bf lived in but i only recognized one but he no longer lives there. he asked for my bf’s number and i gave it to him.
he called him and asked where does he stay he said he stays with friends and family and said he can use dad’s address. investigator took his dad’s address and said “we should be good but if he needed anything he would call back.” and i forgot i put down that i was working less hours because i was on maternity leave but i was still getting paid. i thought when they call me for an interview, i can explain everything but i never got one. they also never asked me to submit any documents. i applied in july and got a letter in august that i was approved. 

i’ve been worried sick. i can’t sleep,
i barely eat. everything online says i’m going to jail. i called cao and there’s no update. one person who was a bit helpful said they didn’t know i was being investigated because there was nothing on my file that looked fraudulent or said i was being investigated but asked me to send a copy of my lease and a letter from my bf saying he pays rent and he doesn’t live with me. i told him i send that to the investigator and he said there wasn’t anything on file. i send that in along with a letter saying i wanted to close my case. i’ll reapply once this matter is dealt with. i saw my fs increased to 177 for oct and i panicked and closed the case. i don’t want them to keep sending me benefits. and the fs for sept are still sitting in my card. two weeks later,  i call today and again no update. only that i closed my case and that a investigator spoke to me about my son’s father. how fucked am i? i’m so worried. i just gave birth. i can’t go to jail. i can’t afford a lawyer. what’s going to happen?"

"california pandemic ebt deposit time for nov calwin? | several very cheap, nutritious, and tasty meal options when relying on ebt/snap | ca ebt suspended, demanding crypto currency statements with name and account number. has anyone gotten nov pandemic ebt for calwin deposited yet (dec 17th)?

i am in san francisco, and from what i can find, the pandemic-ebt for calwin is supposed to be deposited today, dec 17. however, nothing has appeared yet, and it is generally at midnight, though i have seen it show up earlier, last time that happened was maybe 6 months ago. but i have never seen it arrive late, as i usually stay up until midnight to put in an amazon fresh order with an early 6:00 am delivery.  it is 5:00 am and no deposit yet.

do i have the date right? were issues the last few months with a non-state website being off by a day, and most places were just quoting that site, which led a lot of people to be expecting ebt a day before it was actually issued, but the official ebt site says dec 17th. or am i reading something wrong? just checking. thanks!

i attended 2 different culinary schools and have a bas in culinary arts, but am only a hobbyist, as working in the industry started to quickly ruin my love for cooking. anyways, i have been trying to find meals with the best ratio of price vs # of servings vs nutrition vs yummies, and while i am still playing around with some meals, but i wanted to throw out a few suggestions. 

all of the prices are from amazon prime fresh, which accepts ebt/snap in california at least, not sure about other states, and does not require a prime membership if using ebt. prime fresh has been a life saver, letting me have teh chance to really think about what i am buying and adding up prices, rather than having to worry about getting to checkout and not having enough ebt... they also have a lot more items, and the deals are better, plus you get free delivery to your door. 

the first meal is tuna salad.

on amazon fresh, these are the ingredients/prices:

starkist chunk light tuna in water, 11 oz pouch starkist chunk light tuna in water, 11 oz pouch $4.79

kraft real mayo creamy & smooth mayonnaise (12 fl oz bottle) $3.19

amazon brand - happy belly sweet relish, 10 ounce $1.19

celery 1 bunch $1.99

yellow onion $1.19

final price: $12.35 however, you can get several salads out of the ingredients, minus the tuna, so i suggest you get 2 or 3 of the 11 oz tuna packets.. one of them makes enough tuna to last 5 days with 2 people, eating 2 sandwiches a day..  the biggest issue is that tuna salad has a fridge life of 5 days, meaning you might not even be able to finish it all. $16 for 2 weeks of food... not bad. 

another affordable meal, (can be a meal or an ingredient) is brussel sprouts.  you can get a 12 oz bag of trimmed brussel sprouts for $2.99 and all you need is some kosher salt and butter... melt the butter in a pan, trim the bottom stem off the brussel sprouts so they cook evenly, cut in half and place in the pan with a decent pinch of kosher salt over them. let them cook until brown or almost looking burnt, then flip and continue until they are soft and easy to eat. most people can't believe just how yummy they are when fried or baked (never boil, icky), plus cheap, and amazingly.... a 12 oz bag has 145 calories only, which can easily feed 2-3 people, giving you a filling snack at under $100 calories...  

if you want to take it further, you can go the bubble'n'squeak route by adding a couple eggs after they are done cooking and some cheese.. 3 eggs and some cheddar only adds 250 calories to the meal.. and an 18 pack of eggs is under $5, and cheese varies a lot but can be found cheap too. 

i have also managed to get my ebt to last longer by getting slim fast shake powder $8.79 plus the price of dairy, i get the 96 oz vanilla almond breeze for $4.09. this gives you 14 meals for $12.88 and is actually pretty effective at weight loss, as long as you stick to the 4 100 calorie snacks and one meal a day, else your body starts to hold on to more fat  and it backfires. this is where the brussel sprouts come into play, as 100 calorie snacks. 

for a quick and cheap meal. stir fry rice-a-roni is $1.09 a box, and  actually pretty good.

and finally, bear creek soups. they range from $3.59 to $4.79, and make 8 large servings of incredibly yummy soup that takes 15 min or so to cook, just pour in the mox, add water and boil. however, one of the best meals they have is the ""damn good chili"" but that does require 1lb of ground beef and a small can of tomato paste, but it lasts for several days and is really good chili. other than that, i highly recommend the cheddar potato and cheddar brocolli, though all of the soups are really good, better than any canned soup, and they have at least 15 different flavors.

anyways, i just wanted to toss out some ideas for anyone struggling with hunger and nutrition while on ebt/snap/etc.

i am on ca ebt following catching covid, when i applied in january, i hit an issue because i had not made any income in several months, and they said they needed to know how i was supporting myself, so i submitted an income affidavit, along with a screenshot of my atomic wallet, as i had been mining ravencoin to survive at the time, and we are only talking $10 a week maximum, it was how i could eat. 

i had ebt, then a few days ago, i had to submit the sar 7 income report, which i did, i had no income, and had just got onto caap while i recover.  they suspended my ebt, i called them up, and they said i hadn't submitted the sar 7 or the income affidavit properly. i did it again, and called them. first they said the affidavit was invalid, some about i ""comma"" name hereby  blah bal, supposedly i am missing a comma? ok.. then they said they need to verify i have not earned any crypto. so i sent them a screenshot of my wallet, showing no activity since january. i explained in my affidavit that the crypto had split, and the revenue off mining wasn't worth mining anymore and i stopped in january.  they told me i have to give them an account statement for ravencoin with my name, and account number on it for it to be valid, until then, they can not approve me, and then they denied my applications.

&#x200b;

what the f do i do? i can't get a statement with my name from ravencoin, that isn;t how it works, the guy was a complete dick. i have 0 income right now, and i haven;t had ebt in a month.  any ideasa?"
"[ca] need advice re how to come clean - accidentally committed fraud hi reddit, i recently discovered that i have accidentally committed fraud by not reporting income and have been pretty stressed. i do intend to ""turn myself in"" and try to come clean but am wondering what's the best way to approach this.

a little background: my spouse worked a minimum wage job in the food industry (no tip position) and her hours varied every week, anywhere from 15-25 hours. i am a contract worker so it's always a famine or feast situation, and needless to say my income fluctuates a lot.

2019 was a very dry year for me, and i only worked a total of 2 months by the time my spouse and i applied for calfresh for the first time in november 2019. i just took a look at our original application and we put $8k for her yearly income, and $15k for my yearly income. both numbers were estimates based on our situation at the time.

i am not exactly sure how/why it happened this way but our application was under my spouse's name with her as the main contact. she was the one who got interviewed on the phone and got approved, etc, but i am actually the one handling finance in our household. so here comes the problem - i knew nothing about the program and didn't bother to look into our responsibilities... soon after we were approved, i actually got another job which lasted till mid december. my spouse's situation stayed the same. the idea of reporting change of income never even crossed our mind.

fast forward to 2020, my spouse's situation is still more or less the same but i again worked a contract job from feb to april (did not report), and lost the job due to covid before i went on unemployment in early april (also did not report).

we received a recertification letter recently and that's when i realized that i should have 1) reported my ui benefit and 2) reported change of income while i had my contract jobs (my income was $0 when we applied for calfresh). our 2019 tax filing shows $31k gross income, which is $8k more than the estimate we put in our original application. we obviously are not wealthy and had zero intention to cheat the system but am not sure if they'll believe us.

our phone interview is scheduled for 2pm on thursday and i want to be on the phone as well so i can explain the situation as it was only me who had a change of income significant enough to affect our eligibility.

where do i even start? ui because they certainly see that in their system? what do i even say about my contract jobs and reasons for not reporting them months ago? we stopped using our ebt card immediately after this realization and will fully cooperate to pay back anything we owe. i just don't want this to become a legal/criminal matter and have it on my record.

last question - we do not want to be considered for renewal. we actually decided to move abroad after the holidays (lots of self reflection during covid). how do i withdrawal/request for our case to be terminated?

thank you very much."
"[help!] my p-ebt card is activated but i can’t use it as it doesn’t accept any of the ssn i put in to make the pin (illinois) my card is activated but strangely it did not work with the pin i use for my normal ebt card, so when i tried to do as the automated phone call prompt said to make a pin for the card it kept saying that the social security number is wrong, even though i put in the ssn for the person on the card, then i tried with the ssn from both my parents, which also didn’t work.

"new to snap -- logistical questions hi everyone! i am new to receiving snap benefits (applied in august, approved in early september, only used once so far). for some reason using them makes me really nervous (not because of the stigma, but more that i'll do something wrong) had some logistical questions about using the card that i'm not sure exactly who to ask. for reference i am in hawaii if that matters for any of the questions.

1. how long does the money added to your card stay on your card if you don't use it all?
2. what happens if something that i get isn't covered when i go through the checkout that i didn't realize? will the whole purchase be declined or will i just have to pay for the items that aren't approved?
3. has anyone used the food stamps at farmer's markets? i know they allow it in some places, is there any logistical things to know about that?
4. is there anything weird that isn't directly mentioned in the fine print that you would think is covered but actually isn't? i don't want to accidentally try to buy things that aren't covered."

"advice hello, i wanted to see if anyone had some advice for me. i am from california and was receiving food stamps, then my reciterfication period came. i submitted my documents and told my case worker abt some circumstances, being on an unpaid leave and then termination, new job i still havent received my first check from, and a one day job i had. i was given a letter to turn in additional documents, which i did. throughout this whole time i've been calling and leaving messages each day and my worker never picked up. i found out today that i've been deactivated.

i just don't know what to do as i did turn in everything and even my income went down with everything else remaining the same as either way i qualify due to me receiving cal grant. it sucks because i did everything on my end and my case worker never picked up the phone or answered the messages through cal benefits.
i really depend on food stamps to afford food. do i have to reapply or is there a way to argue my case, or is it too late.

"household of elderly and disabled eligibility question i was wondering about the eligibility for a household of two people, one of whom is considered elderly and the other receives ssi benefits due to legal blindness. the snap benefits are given to my mom (the elderly person in this situation) and we received a letter with updated benefits… but they only counted her retirement check. i called in october as i started receiving ssi benefits in november. they didn’t take into consideration what i’ll be receiving. 

first question: will my ssi benefits be factored into her snap benefits? 

if so, because the irt is lower than what our combined gross monthly income will be, will she lose her benefits permanently? 

additional information: we live in california (l.a. to be more specific). 

thank you in advance."

i’m getting paid, but i might not be getting paid in a month’s time… but i want to follow the rules with regard to my snap case.

her snap benefit renewal came up. she asked her worker multiple times what she needed to do to qualify for snap still, and let them know she is taking enough credits to be considered half time. the worker would not tell her anything and only said that they would let her know if they needed additional documentation. they did not ask for her school schedule or enrollment, school name, nothing. 

she got a letter saying she was ineligible for snap benefits.

i'm just wondering what all these amounts are suppose to mean and if this is normal? it's listed under my ""lone star card activities"".  i also currently have over a thousand dollars in that card's balance which cannot be right, and i assume it was a coding error. what's happening here?

my first snap renewal was automatic. i got the letter in the mail stating that it would be from 12/1/22 to 5/31/23. i started my new job on 12/5/22.

 i called to have my medicaid canceled because my insurance would begin sometime in january 2023. they had me send an email to the worker i was on the phone with and told me it would be canceled. i think i also received something in the mail about cancelation. 

after my first paycheck i called to report my income change and stated that i wanted to stop receiving snap. the worker asked for my identifying info and just confirmed that i wanted to stop receiving snap benefits. they didn't ask for verification of my increased income though. i thought everything was handed.

well yesterday i received a letter about the extra benefits stopping. i didn't think much of it. today, while placing an order for my groceries i just got the feeling to check the balance. so i've received benefits (plus the extras) from jan & feb 2023. 

i didn't spend any of it and i plan on calling them monday morning. i know that i didn't do anything wrong/illegal but i just don't want to be investigated. especially since my new job is with the county (athough different departments).

can anyone provide any insight into what the process will look like? will i be investigated? how/will they be able to just deduct the funds from the account?"

i could make the argument that can't make it to the office... but is it easier on the phone or in person?

i have a balance on my card.

this has happened twice in 3 months.

i utilize the card, enter my pin, and on the ending step it says card declined, contact issuer.

the only thing i can think of is i tried to go over the balance.  like i had $10 on the card and tried to buy $15 worth of food, but usually when this happens it just pulls the rest and makes me use a different card for what's left; for example, pay $5 with a separate card after using the $10 on snap.

why does this happen?"

since it’s my mother do we have to be on the same account? she is on tube feedings so we do not prepare food together. and even when she goes back to eating it will be only a soft diet and protein drinks not the food everyone else eats. 

i’ve looked at the income guidelines and it looks like my income might be too much. by a little. i don’t want it to effect her benefits.

"worth applying? i was recently encouraged to look into food stamps in ny for suny students by my sister, but i figured i’d ask here before submitting an application. i read through the qualifications listed on their website, but i can imagine i missed something that completely went over my head. i dorm at stony brook, work ~23 hours a week, and when schools out i’m living at home with my ma and two sisters in queens (nobody in my household is on snap). they mentioned having a meal plan at your college would disqualify you, but i was considering quitting the meal plan if it meant i could qualify. i’m paying tuition out of pocket and living paycheck to paycheck, so this would be a huge help. if anyone has had a similar experience i’d really appreciate the help!"
"withdrawing from snap, anxious about the process i got a new job the last week of june. i didn’t get paid until july and needed to use the july allotment for groceries. after my first paycheck, it’s clear that i make too much and am ineligible for snap.

will i have to repay for july? or do they cancel it and you’re fine?

if i do have to pay it back, are there legal ramifications? does that go on a record somewhere?

question for all caseworker? how do we prevent overpayment so renewal is coming up in october how do everyone prevent overpayment for snap and be on the safe safe side. last reporting was in april sar when do we have do our reporting october doing renewal or we are over the income for that this month. do caseworker look at overpayment doing renewal?


hi there question and curious do caseworker use last  30 day of income from the work number data exchange what ever you guys called it they look at previous months and. 
3 as  well  doing renewal and sar. can we not send in our pay stub can use that data sources instead.

i did my sar reporting last april and is now end of july is say no request verification need and my renewal is in october does that mean my food stamp is good and insurance. does that mean i don’t need to anything. do i need to report my income or until october.

hi there question how far back do casework look back income when doing renewal  and sar last 6 month or 1 year how do caseworker do overpayment how many month on we miss reporting income or how does it work just curious. most of us report income every 6 month doing sar and renewal any recommendation from prevent from any overpayment. we have the same job over 10 year.

households with all adult members who are elderly/disabled and have earned income

will receive a 24-month renewal period. these households will receive a review form at

the 6th, 12th and 18th month due to sar enrollment.



households not enrolled in sar will receive a 24-month renewal period with a

telephone contact in the 12th month

this is what i found does your state do this as well

my mom will be turning. 60 in september and my dad is 62 in october my dad his working right now, my dad is retiring start in november his renewal for snap and medicaid is in october will be considered in esap up coming renewal should report a change of income in november when he retire what is the policy we are in pa philadelphia. i was reading a policy saying everyone in the household with earn income with a 2 year renewal is that true with sar every 6 month correct me if i am wrong. thank you so much much

i am curious on how snap is calculated it do they use last 30 day of income or they
estimated your income. on renewal and sar. let say if i make 1200 for the month of may do they use 1200 for my income or caseworker estimates it higher or lower. maybe anyone else  is curious as well.

i received a letter in march that i had unclaimed pebt benefits summer 2022-2023. i called them and they processed each claim number. i have three kids total. they said they would be sending out three separate cards, that they would come in blank white envelopes. they confirmed my address again and then said it would take several weeks. i checked everyday. at the end of may it finally showed that i called on march 17th and each child would receive $391.  i thought i would give it another week. 2nd week of june rolls around,  i call again.  i wait forever to talk to someone. after going through the whole story again, the representative tells me that they can't give me any information because it's a different like company that processes the cards and sends them out. and i asked her well what should i do and she said to wait that it takes several weeks for them to get here. and i explained her again that it already been several weeks. she told me to call back if i don't get them. which makes no sense because i already asked her can she help me and told her that i didn't receive them.  does anyone have any insight or guidance to give. thank you in advance

my daughter (27 f), and my mother (75f) live together. in may 2022, my daughter needed help taking care of my mother; she is in college and got a promotion at work. she made an arrangement with me, that she will give me a place to live for free; in exchange for looking after my mother and doing all their house work,  errands and care for their 2 pets. if i were to not do any one of those things or things that fall into that category, the free place to stay would no longer be on the table. it doesn't leave me much room for working a job. 

i still have 3 kids under the age of 18, that i care for. my daughter has now included their clothes and personal hygiene items, but says i will need to provide our food after this month, april at the latest.

"snap denied for missing documents, but sent everything with original application - texas my food stamps were up for renewal, last day was 1/31. i received a letter 1/19 stating i was missing documents that were sent with the original application at the end of december. i called as soon as i got the letter making them aware. they checked and stated they saw them with the application and everything should be good. fast forward to today, i opened the app and saw that i was denied. so again, i called to ask why i was denied, just because i wanted to know, and i was told i was missing info/documents. i explained the same thing, we then went through the documents that were uploaded while we were on the phone and they said it was all there, apparently some of the documents were coded as renewal or other on their end. the person i spoke with said they wrote a note and would send it for review again, but that it would be best if i went ahead and applied again because sometimes the old ones do not get rechecked and if they do it might take a while. is that true? does anyone know how long it would take to get looked at again or how i should follow up with this? sorry, to be a bother, but i’m just a little lost since all the documents have been submitted and this hasn’t happened to me before. any advice or info would be greatly appreciated! thanks!!"
"denied in california so frustrated. my family of 4 (two adults, both disabled vets and two kids under age 12) apparently make too much money at $3400 a month in disability payments, to qualify for calfresh. our rent alone is $2300 a month. i'd love the people who set these income limits, try to live in california and survive as a family."
"calfresh section 15 question | can i work a part time job if i qualify for work study and still qualify for calfresh? the question asks *does anyone you purchase and prepare food with get billed for any household expenses?*

do my college roommates count? we don't share meals or purchase food together but they do pay part of the rent, bills, etc. 

county: san francisco

i already qualify for work-study now so i qualify for calfresh through that aspect. however, i am potentially thinking of doing some private tutoring a few hours a week (<40 hours per month, less than $2k a month) to get some extra cash for gas, bills, etc. 

would this disqualify me from calfresh? if not, what is the limit i can make per month to continue having calfresh? 

county is san francisco if that makes a difference. "
"illinois switching from self employment to regular employment hi there! i live in illinois and am going to be getting officially hired at a new job soon after being self employed. i know im supposed to report these changes, but im confused as to when. am i supposed to report as soon as im hired or not until i get my first paycheck? i’m not supposed to actually start working for another week or 2."
"sc dss - thanks for nothing!! snap i applied for snap in sc this morning.  reviewing sc dss website i see there's an issue with what was entered on my application and what is showing up as entered!  so, being the it person that i am, i started to do another application to see if i can recreate the error (didn't submit or finish the application).  sure enough, boom!!  the error is if you enter n to if you're working when you pull up the application (not the pdf version, the online version pop up window) it is displaying y, you are working!  

i'm afraid this will get me denied (over their software error).  i called, spent 1 hour 29 minutes 50 seconds on hold before the hold music goes to a ringing phone that never picks up, it disconnects.

i'm so damn tired of horrible customer service in government agencies around here.  i'm about out of food, pua ends next week, rent is due the 1st.  i may be short rent if i have to spend my last cash at walmart for food if i don't get approved (and i really don't think i will - applied 2 times during lockdown and was denied because i was receiving pua - unbelievable).  i'm so tired."

"didn't realize i needed to report internship stipends to ebt hello, i have been receiving calfresh ebt since august 2022 since i am unemployed student and was qualified. however, beginning of june 2023 (a month ago) i randomly got an internship position and was told that i was being paid a stipend and that it was not considered ""employment"" so i thought i did not need to report it to ebt. so for the month of june, up until now (july 13) i got two reloads of my snap benefits while getting one pay check that was over my irt. two weeks ago they called me asking about renewing the ebt and i just told them to cancel it. but just last night i realized any income should be reported so i started freaking out about not reporting the stipend i received for the month of june while receiving benefits in june and july (my ebt is officially canceled by the end of july). what should i do?"
"question about reporting income i am likely going to be getting a promotion in the next couple of months which will increase my family's income by a few hundred a month. we still will be eligible for food stamps, but at a smaller amount. do i need to report this within 10 days of it happening, or is this something i can do at our 6 month reporting period?

"caseworker not communicating and expenses calculated incorrectly. pa i live in pa, i recently moved and at the same time got a new employer. when i recertified i submitted all expenses such as rent and utilities and when approved my benefits went down from 750 to low 300s. i expected a drop because of higher wages but not that drastically, im still only grossing 1640 and have 2 dependants. looking on the compass app it has my only expenses as shelter, nothing else even though listing each on the most recent recert. my gas bill alone has been almost 300 each month not to mention utilities. i've been calling  the caseworker endlessly, leaving messages with no calls backs. my additional expenses are substantial, 400 for gas an electric alone. would this increase my allotment and any idea how to contact someone to change this?"

i applied for benefits in ny but i havent heard back yet. i received a one-time payment, but no approval. is that a sign that something is wrong? it's never taken this long before so it's making me nervous. should i be worried? if you only receive the one-time payment does that mean you won't get the extra for january? is it better to save what i have to use for next month to be safe?"

"eligibility questions hi folks. i was fired today from my job of 2.5 years.

i have ~$2100 in my bank account, 0 income of any type, no job lined up (ill start putting in applications today). i haven't had foodstamps since i was a homeless drug addict in new mexico - ~10 years ago. i dont really know how government assistance as a whole works, the only time i ever had it i was so strung out i didnt remember the application process even a week later. also i think it was non standard as i didnt have any form of id at the time.

there are 9 people in my home (i live in an oxford house) these people have no relation to me, no obligation to help me in any way, nor would i want to ask them to do so, also, regarding the va benefit eligibility checks, i don't even know how old most of them are. do i need to list these people? will the fact that there are so many people in my home affect my eligibility? like i said we're not related or anything.

is the fact that i have $2100 in my bank going to be a problem? with rent, car payments, insurance, bills, etc, $2100 can be gone in the blink of an eye frfr."

"pa snap - employer refusing to give termination letter not my situation, but posting here for a friend who doesn’t have reddit. 

he had food stamps two years ago and left the job he had when he was initially approved for them. he didn’t update the county that he found a new employer and got cut off which was fine because he could afford to feed himself then with his new job at the time. he didn’t think he would be approved anyway. 

he is applying again and the county is still asking for the termination letter from when he left that first job two years ago. 

his old job has a change of manager and when he checks in again for the letter he explains short-hand that the main reason he left was due to finding better pay over the time-limited brief phone call he had. they were confused why he was only an employee for two weeks and why he would need this. 

he later explains after getting an email to contact (& able to provide more detail)  that that the reason why he was an employee for only two weeks was because he couldn’t secure training hours with the previous management, forcing him to continue his job search which lead him to getting better pay than what the job was offering him. 

new manager is now refusing to fill out paperwork and accusing him of wanting them to falsify records because he didn’t say that over the phone, so they’re not going to do it.

he just tells them they can verify with the previous managers what his hours were and why he left.

the question is does it matter if they put he found better wages or if he couldn’t get training hours? he left a full two years ago and he is employed full-time elsewhere. he would not be receiving unemployment benefits, the county just needs notice from the employer that he isn’t an employee of that company anymore. the letter they need to sign is dated for 2021 as well. 

is there any work around for this if an employer is not cooperating? what can he do?

thanks"

"help with verifying identity (living in florida)

i originally applied in july for food stamps with my boyfriend on my case, however i missed the deadline to send in the proof of self employment form.

we broke up during this time and i became homeless but have been staying with his parents for the time being. i reapplied as homeless and during the interview i was told i needed to go the the office to verify my identity with some form of government id which i don't have right now. 

i got a letter yesterday stating i could have someone verify that i am who i say i am, with a copy of their id. the deadline is tomorrow. what is needed for this? what will happen when i go? 

this is the first time i'm applying and when i asked someone i know who has applied while homeless they said they didn't need to verify identity so i don't know what to expect. i'm also afraid i might get flagged for fraud though i'm not committing it which scares me as i'm truly just in a tough spot right now."

"how to help mom qualify if i live with her? mom's 70, receiving ssi (\~1100/mo). she owns a house in another state that she rents out for 2200/mo. currently, she lives in an apartment in new york (which is 2400/mo -- i also live with her. we usually split the costs of the rental, except recently i've been out of work so she has paid all of it (mostly out of her rental income).

some complications, i guess, are that i'm the leaseholder. plus she has 20k in her savings (which is all she has for retirement).

her application says she pays 2400/mo in rent, which is technically true right now. are they gonna ask about me and why i don't pay any rent? we do file separately and everything, but is it gonna complicate the household if the app says she's a household of 1?"

"can inform me about my options.? hello everyone about ca ebt rules and regulations due to the fact that i have been under my mom\\s case since i\\m guessing the start of the pandemic, i'm trying to find information on whether or not if someone else is in the same circumstances that i am in, i have called repeatedly to get my case separated in the state of california, but i am repeatedly told i cannot separate my case because i'm under hers. i don\\t understand because i have done this before the pandemic, is this something that started when the pandemic came about or is it because of the pandemic relief extra money they have been allotting to people that is set to expire next month? 

even so i still don\\t understand why that would prevent me from separating my case from hers, my guess and this is only a guess is that it's easier for the county to not over allot extra payments to people? but i find that ridiculous cause everything is in their system, so they\\d be the ones controlling what's happening not me?

&#x200b;

the reason i'm asking is because i am not on speaking terms with my mother and it\\s a very challenging process to even deal with her so for a while now i have not been going to her for cash aid, instead relying on my stimulus payments. it's a long story but basically, i informed edd/dpss of this and they said they would send an escalation notice to the worker and within 3 business days i should hear back from them. i made this call on a friday and checked back monday even though i was told they would call me, no one answered, so i managed to call back the 3rd day and finally got someone on the phone who informed me my case was\\t able to be separated (they gave no reason or said it was part of their rules) but they kept saying i could be separated but only by her which made me more confused?! because why? 

&#x200b;

they guy who told me to just wait till benefits ran out next month then i could apply on my own sent the escalation ticket when i informed him, she can be very confrontational and abusive so that is why i wasn't keen on asking for access from the card from her. i promptly informed him i been using my own savings for food ( i know that might not matter because benefits were allotted to all of us, i don\\t want the missing benefits i just want the case to be under my name so i don't have to use her card or go to her for those benefits that she's getting but i'm not even using for myself and yes it's fine if they restart my case with no money except for what\\s generally allotted.)

&#x200b;

so once i informed him of this circumstance that's when he found it necessary to issue an escalation notice to the eligibility workers, so i called and was told all of that basically and that i informed them i wanted my case separated but no one had called me yet so  she said she would submit it again for the second time but this time i noted she said i would have to keep up with them (i'm not foregoing the possibility the first guy told me that, but i am strongly in belief that was not the case the first time around) so i said okay, 

&#x200b;

i then asked some follow up questions i the event that would be denied anyways for whatever rules are in place, i asked the person i was speaking with if it's possible to get a separate ebt card to use under her case instead of a replacement that way i could access the benefits to instead of going directly to her for the card. 

&#x200b;

i was then told that it was an option unbeknownst to me at the time because no one had ever told me this before that the main case holder can do that by filling out a simple form that's available and submitting it to the office. (what!?)

&#x200b;

you mean to tell me i could've had access to our benefits the entire time we were receiving them without having to go through the main case holder?!

&#x200b;

it still doesn't make sense why it\\s limited to her authorization only. the only reason i could think of is because she was the main one that filed and claimed me at the time for being under her case.  but even so it's ridiculous to tell me that i can't separate myself from her unless she wants it.

&#x200b;

is it possible she made me out to be unable to care for myself and perhaps made it so that i wouldn't be able to separate myself? i am not one to jump to conclusions like that so easily, i am wondering if that's something edd/dpss does though? because if so, i had no idea of that status of myself while on her case nor did i ever authorize her to do something like that.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so, in simplicity all i'm asking is whether someone knows in depth about how the case are being affected right now due to the pandemic and if they know they are doing this for everyone? is there a way around this? i am in los angeles county by the way. is anyone in similar situation? what advice do you recommend to me?

&#x200b;

note: please be kind and do not suggest i start talking to my mother, it is a personal situation and i understand not everyone will understand (or care for that matter) but as of right now it is not an option unless absolutely necessary and the only two scenarios, i can see something like that happening is if either:

1. i inform her and request to be separated from her benefits case.
2. i ask her to fill out the secondary ebt card authorization form and submit it to tithe office so i can get my own card to use my portion of the benefits with.

i\\d like to know if anyone is in a similar situation?"

i have 34 cents on snap. the ea for colorado was supposed to be given out the 8th to the 13th and todays the 21st and nothing. i sent an email to my caseworker thursday trying to get info on what’s happening and i haven’t got an answer. i’m getting to the point where this is causing me major anxiety. is anyone else still waiting too? is it las animas county in general or is it just a me problem?

has anyone else not received the extra amount yet? the paperwork says it should have been from the 8th to the 13th but i’ve yet to receive any, nor do i have any updated information in my copeak mailbox. i have 34 cents, and it’s frustrating that things aren’t done when they say they will be.

i know that they were approved for colorado in dec and were supposed to be sent between the 7th and 12th. i got my regular monthly amount ($23, woohoo) but not the maximum amount. did anyone else not get it? do i need to call and see what’s going on?"

"[ny] question about ebt snap food stamp surplus i have been receiving $250/mo in snap food stamp benefits as well as an additional $95/mo in emergency allotment snap benefits. i am a single person and only buy food for myself. i generally eat only one or two meals a day and do not spend lavishly. over time i have accumulated a significant surplus balance on my ebt card. now that i have received my benefits for this month i have a balance of a little over $1000. i think my surplus goes up around $100 a month. i am wondering if there is a limit to how much of a surplus i can accumulate or if this could be a red flag when i recertify for benefits or somehow prevent me from recertifying. i use my ebt card once a week for a large shopping trip and sometimes use it an additional time for a small trip, so it isn't as though i am letting the balance build up without using my benefits.

thanks very much for your help."

"thank you for a 2nd chance at life i got ebt for the first time today in cali. it's going to save me and my best friends lives. we've been living off 4-5$ a day for 2 years. mostly a diet of whole wheat bread, eggs, brown rice, lentils, oats and whole grain pasta. when there was room in the budget we'd get onions, garlic, bananas, apples, frozen vegetables, milk, yogurt, or cheese. when we had rare opportunities to spend a bit more we would buy 1-2 lbs of meat and try to spread it out over 7 meals. sometimes they'd have special deals on different things or give out free stuff which we would always be on top of.

we have to walk several hours to get anything we need and that's only after couponing for hours to find things we can barely afford. all during this pandemic. it's a dreadful feeling to just survive and walk to feed yourself every day knowing you're not even hitting all the food groups. all of my socks are destroyed full of holes and my feet are blistered. there was no money for anything extra except cleaning supplies, no health insurance so if something went wrong we were screwed. the way this has affected my best friend was the worst part, running out of money and looking for change to pay for couponed bread and seeing the look on their face knowing it was just gonna be more of this. getting fruits/vegetables felt like a luxury. all these grains had us feeling sluggish and depressed.

now what little we had in our lives was coming to an end too, and homeless was looming, so i looked for help and found out about the ebt process. i applied and got it almost instantly. i just got home after finishing it and knowing it was expedited and it's safe and sound and real. it doesn't feel real. the lady who helped me on the phone was amazingly helpful and kind and continued to help me throughout the process until the end. the ladies at the office i went to today were also just as helpful and kind. i felt like i was dealing with caring people who had compassion and understanding. i don't really have family near me to depend on and i didn't trust i would qualify for any help from government, but after seeing how quickly my life just got beyond saved... i feel stupid for not getting help sooner. the amount of ebt covering our food is probably 4x the amount we were spending on things for our selves in a month, and that's counting cleaning supplies.

with ebt covering our food (and being able to buy a variety of vegetables/fruits/meat/etc) we can now afford to buy bikes and find work and save our lives and get out of this mess. the 3 hour walk of doom can now be a half hour commute. on the most positive side, i went from 450 to 190 lbs. so, i feel blessed for a 2nd chance."

"just got approved for food stamps for the first time ever, and i’m shaking. $450 a month. that’s how much we got approved for, and that’s how much we would spend before on groceries if we splurged. no more 3 course meals of cheerios, no more “it’s only a week past date and it doesn’t smell bad yet.” no more hitting up relatives to see if they had any old frozen food they didn’t want anymore. i’m so happy, i could cry right now. this is gonna give us the breathing space we need till i start my new job, i’ll be able to keep our car from being repossessed by selling my plasma. and with any luck, we should be able to afford rent when my check comes in. first check won’t be till past the first, but we are lucky enough to have a waiver for a late payment to use. it felt like everything was hopeless this morning; like we were at the bottom of a pit, and a rope, thin as it is, was just dropped down for us to hang on to.

"[california] recertification was approved but got a text alert saying it was for $0 | submitted calfresh reapplication a month+ ago, still haven’t received approval | one time large payment, how will it effect my ebt? california, san bernardino county 

solved

family of three, was getting 800 a month. it looks like we were approved for recertification but our text alert said it was for $0. nothing has changed financially in the past 3 years we’ve been using them. calbenfits website said it’s still active for 800 

i’m kinda scared and not sure what to do, we can barely pay the bills each month and without the food stamps things are only going to get worse. 

what could possibly be going on?

edit: leaving this up for anyone who might need it. i called and the representative said for this month it’s getting marked as $0 but come next ebt refill we’ll get the same amount again.

if you are having trouble just keep calling and good luck 👍

i submitted my cal fresh reapplication in november with the due date being january 5. calfresh says they still have not received my application and any phone number provided leads to a dead end. they say they cannot confirm my identification also no agents have called me back. (the numbers i have been given are for my local offices, they worked before, but for some reason have stopped sending me to an agent)

i’m getting frustrated/worried and i’m wondering if i should just submit the application online too or, if i should still wait. i am afraid the one i submitted online plus the physical reapplication i sent in might mess up the process.

responses are appreciated, i’m running out of time and don’t know what to do

i am in san bernardino county, california

me and my mom are currently using calfresh ebt. my mother doesn't work so i often take very very small jobs like freelance work, just barely enough to pay rent and some bills. recently i've been offered a lucrative offer for a freelance job that will pay me one time for about 5k+. this is very exciting and i'd very much love to take the job as this could benefit me greatly in the future when applying for other jobs, however i'm afraid to take it.

obviously earning 5k in a month goes over the monthly threshold for ebt eligibility. problem is i'm afraid of losing the ebt in the long run just because i made a lot of money one time. since this is a freelance job for a major company i can't claim this as a gift since their will most definitely have a contract for this job. 

is there anything i could do to not lose my ebt? could i end up getting back on it at a later date if i get taken off?"

"ssdi benefits for minors | retroactive ssdi payment and medicaid in pennsylvania pennsylvania

i know earned income for minors does not count against our snap income but what about ssdi?

i apologize for asking about this here, but i know many of the caseworkers handle both and i tried in /r/medicaid and nobody responded.

it is my understanding that phe will keep this from being an issue for the moment, but i would like to get it permanently resolved ahead of time.

i had to wait three years for my ssdi benefits to start and during that time, i amassed a very significant retroactive amount. my understanding is that this payment is exempt from the asset test for a period of six months, however, with the size of this payment, there is absolutely no way that it will be exhausted in that period.

i am on medicare now, so personally, i would be fine without medicaid, however, my children very much need the coverage.

short of gifting it to one of my children to buy a house, is there any way that i can keep medicaid despite this windfall?

"ssi cutting payments and told me to tell snap. worth the call? | odd letter cutting benefits my disabled 22 year old son gets ssi and food stamps. he had a job thru dept of rehab in jan, feb, mar of 2023. i informed ssi of job via a phone call (yearly assessment)  and i  sent in pay stubs monthly. in july 2023 they sent me a letter saying son was overpaid and unless i could prove it wasn’t our fault and that the money was spent on him, they’d start talking money out for payback in october. well, i did tell them, and the money was spent in him and i can prove it, but he also owes the money, so i let it go and they’ll take out money, all fine. today i get a letter reminding me of the situation and stating we should call call fresh (snap in california) and notify them of ssi payment change. son currently gets 244 a month in food stamps. ssi will be withholding $113 a month from payments for 5 months. is it worth me making the call or will it just be a hassel i should skip?

oc ca the weirdest thing happened. letter yesterday from dept of social services stating son’s cal fresh will drop from $288 a month to $23 a month because he has an income and is not paying utilities. he has no income, he does pay fair share which includes utilities. nothing has changed. where on earth do they get thier information from? i filled out the back requesting a hearing. this is so ridiculous. then i gathered a years worth of rent payment proof including utilities, a years worth of his medical costs and his income during the past year. took a chance and called ssa before mailing, and talked to someone named john who said there was a system change over in april and some people’s data went wonky in fields causing a drop in benefits. he said he fixed it. i was so relieved i didn’t need a hearing, i forgot to ask for a letter or some proof of the conversation."
"calfresh fraud questions new here. i recently applied for and received calfresh benefits. after about a month i got notified that they were being revoked because my qualifying child no longer lives with me. the child does in fact live with me so i filed for an appeal, had a hearing, the county told me during the hearing what specific documents i needed to submit and i have since submitted them. i presume that they will reinstate my benefits but who knows how this stuff goes. 

now for my life story and questions. 

i am mid divorce. my ex is somewhat unstable. my ex has claimed our child to receive benefits too. we recently went to court and the court ordered that i am to have sole legal and physical custody of the child. the order states that the child is to have about ten hours of supervised time with the other parent. this seems very straightforward that i should be the one that can claim the child for this purpose.

i got a giant packet from the county that had notes of various events in my case and includes references to claims made by my ex spouse about the child custody. the timing of the statements are such that that they were made to the county agent after the date of the court order. to me, this seems like a clear case of my ex spouse committing fraud to the county.

my question is if there is anything i should do to report the fraud apart from doing what i need to prove that i should receive the benefit.  i have provided documentation that shows the custody order and i expect it to be clear. should i just wait for the county to get back to me?  should i report the fraud somehow?  does it sound like this will get sorted out fairly?

i do not want to report my ex for vindictive reasons, but they have been making many many false accusations about me publicly, partly because of un treated mental illness. my goal is not to get them in trouble but i feel like i need to be addressing these fraudulent issues when they can affect me and my child.

any thoughts?  thank you!"

"idaho p-ebt (pandemic benefits) hi all! i work for ebt in their card replacement department.

if you recently received an ebt card in the mail without knowledge of why, it is because one of your children in school receive free or reduced lunches.

if you are having trouble setting your pin, it is most likely because the date of birth is not yours... the p-ebt cards will come in the parents name, and the oldest child's date of birth (oldest child that's **still in school**).

"question about denial | how would (finally!) getting back child support affect my snap/medicaid benefits in texas? myself and my two young girls have received snap benefits since 2019 after my divorce. i’ve never had an issue. i was notified in early january that my renewal was coming up (feb 28) so within a week i sent it in. i heard nothing until feb 28 when they asked for additional proof of income so i sent my 2022 tax return that day. i still haven’t heard anything but when i log into my benefits account now it says denied even though i haven’t gotten a letter or anything. nothing has changed for me since 2019. i do different side gigs like nanny, uber, doordash, etc…the amount i make from each differs every year but i still make around the same total every year and i’m well below their threshold to be eligible. does anyone have any idea why i’d be denied? i have no assets, literally none. i have personal property of course but i don’t think my thrift store clothes are worth very much lol. or could this just be what it’s saying now and they’re still working on my renewal? any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

i started receiving snap benefits as well as medicaid for my daughters a few months after my divorce in 2019. since then child support has been hit or miss. mostly miss🙄 i think he’s paid maybe $400 or so a year total since then. last august the ag’s office told him he needed to double his payments until he’s caught up. he’s sent $200 since then so that’s not going to happen lol. but, i’ve been fantasizing (how sad this is what my fantasies have come to😂) that he’s going to start paying. eventually he’s going to have to, surely! if he does, and he’s paying me $1000 a month since he’s supposed to double up instead of the $500 he’s ordered to pay i think that would put me over the limit. maybe, i’m not very clear on the deductions and such. honestly, medicaid and snap are worth more to me and my girls than his child support. i don’t want my kids without health insurance. i don’t know that i could afford it without medicaid. does anyone know how the state would handle this? i’ve gone without child support so long, and i dream of the day that i can take even one day off of work a week to spend with my kids. but if we lost snap/medicaid i still couldn’t do that even if i was getting child support. i know i’m worrying over nothing because his ass isn’t going to pay unless he’s forced to by being arrested and if he hasn’t been yet, i don’t see it happening anytime soon. just wondering if anyone’s dealt with this before. 

or…if he is ever arrested 🤞and he had to pay a lump sum to me to get out, how would that affect our benefits? 

sorry for all the rambling and questions, this is just all so confusing to me. thank you in advance for your help:)"
"issues with connecting my case to my account on benefitscal i was on the phone with a customer service agent, and truthfully she wasn't that helpful with the problem. i need to submit my sar 7 and my semi annual recertification, but don't have access to my case on benefits cal. whenever i try to link the two, i get this message.

"pennsylvania question hi. wondering if someone can help me with some clarity. i will have to apply for medical assistance and food stamps for myself and baby soon as i will be leaving my job because of childcare. my babys father and i (not married) live together along with the baby. from what i understand, even though we purchase and prepare food separately, i will have to file us as one household? i will have 0 income but i know the babys father makes too much to qualify. will this deem me ineligible for benefits? thank you."
"michigan ebt problems? i checked and saw that my snap had been cut out of the blue- no letters, no nothing. i checked online, and the most recent had been in october, and i got snap in april last year. i called my local office that has never had a wait longer than 10 people in line, and there were 190 something people in line. i called again and it jumped to 200 in that 5 minutes. is something going on??? i havent seen any articles from local, state, or national papers reporting anything on it. is this normal for the new years? this wasnt my impression, but they did just update the dates it goes out. i would not be worried if my profile had not said i had no available benefits online, and if calling the automated system didnt say anything either."

"fl application questions i am filling out the online application for food stamps and have hit some stumbling blocks. i'm not a boarder i rent a room but i don't get food but i can't find renter to describe me. also what does it mean by (total amount billed). you are asked for total amount billed and monthly amount billed for things like medical expenses so i'm rather confused does that mean yearly?

 i called for an explanation but didn't get anyone. if you all can link me to another place that explains or somewhere that answers the phone i'm good with that as well."
"value of resources? can someone explain what that means on the application? i am so used to listing my annual income.

i rent an apartment, i don't have a car. so what resources? 😅 am i supposed to be like ""well, i bought this book for $5 the other year and still possess it. so that $5 is included in my resources value.""  using the word ""resources"" makes me think it isn't talking about possessions like a book. 🤷🏾‍♂️

i feel so stupid that this question is dumbfounding me. 😂

"snap application says i work, when i don't. i recently applied for snap benefits, but i seem to be having trouble based off of me having too high of an income. it states that i work for two places where i've never worked before. i currently do not work since i'm disabled, but i can't seem to get that off my record. no sign of them shows on my irs records nor my social security records. is this on snaps side? is there any way of taking it off my record or is this something i'll have to deal with for as long as i need snap benefits?

update: after much waiting i have received food stamps. the issue was i need a letter from someone outside my household stating that i don't work for those two companies. the issue is solved and if any of you have the same problem, apparently that's the solution. just be sure to ask the agent if there's any unwanted things on your record."

i applied for a ser to help my utilities/dte . my caseworker has denied me stating my “countable income is higher than the max. allowed” i’m confused because i sent her my pay stubs for the last 30 days which shows my income. each check is $1050. rent $1214. i take care of my nephew (12yr) and he was listed on application. how can i find if my income is high? i’m a substitute teacher who’s income changed due to the holiday & school breaks (thanksgiving, christmas, etc) for which i do not get paid for any of those days. 

she also denied me for snap benefits as well stating the same thing. when i call her, she’s either (1) not answering, or (2) have a unprofessional disposition and tone about herself. like i’m bothering her with any questions i have. i always present myself as understanding and pleasant to her, even though she’s not the same in return. can someone give me some insight ? 

i’d like another case worker who’s more professional. any feedback is much appreciated. thanks!"

"would anything bad happen if my boyfriend applied for food stamps? bay area, ca. 

i recently qualified for snap. me and my boyfriend live together but he’s the only one making income. i’m currently a student and unemployed. we have no kids together, just us two. 

i didn’t include him in my household when applying because i’m the only one who eats home cooked food and for the most part i’m the only one ever cooking or using the stove and buying groceries. he just usually eats out or buys something from a restaurant and brings it home. 

he’s starting to work less and see how important it is to cook food to save money. so we’re wondering would anything happen to my food stamps if he applies and they see we live in the same address? 

should we just leave it alone in order to not ruin anything?"

"my experiences for dealing with ebt theft. (california) hi, everyone! today as of 10/18, i’ve finally got my stolen amount reimbursed into my ebt account, here’s what i go through with the whole process: 
1. when you found out your ebt cash benefit was stolen, first thing you need to do is call the number at the back of the ebt card and talk to a customer service representative to report your card has been skimmed, and tell them how much money has been stolen, remember to ask for a claim number.
2. go to the police station and file an report, in my case i went to the sheriffs department. make sure you mention to the officer, the report is for ebt theft and it’s requested by county worker.
3. after you gather those two informations(claim number and police report), you can go to your nearest social service county office to fill out the ebt2259、ebt2259a、pa1130、pa853 forms. the good things for fill out those forms in county office is, the county workers will help you fill out those forms and make sure there’s no mistake while you fill those out; they will give you a “receipt” saying that they receive those forms and police report, and they can issue you a new ebt card, so you don’t need to wait for the new card in mail.
3. give it about 20 business days, if you don’t receive any letters regarding the claim, you need to call the dpss customer services number. because they are overwhelmed by the large number of ebt theft cases now, sometimes your claim might be left behind, when you call in the customer service just mention that you don’t receive any letters or follow ups for your ebt card claim, they’ll leave a note in the system or expedite your case movement.

for my case, it took 28 days for the stolen benefit to be reimbursed. 

edit 1, i’m in los angeles county.

edit 2, thanks for the heads up from u/sweetpotatoeart! you need to file the claim with county within 10 days."

"i have more on my food stamps balance than i should have i'm getting benefits under calfresh in california. i just got approved and was told i would be getting 20 dollars in snap benefits a month, and i would be getting 10 for october since i applied in the middle of that month. 

well i checked my balance yesterday when my card arrived and for some reason, instead of having the expected 50 in there, i had about 520. does anyone know if this is an error?"

"it finally happened (skimmed, hacked) [california] you card skimmers are the biggest pieces of shit. karma unfortunately doesn't exist, but i really hate people who do that.

my benefits case refreshed today. my food balance was fine. however, my cash benefits were wiped completely clean. someone in a city nowhere near me, wiped my benefits completely out.

the sad part, i don't know how this happened, and i'm just ugh. someone must have copied/skimmed my card, i guess. 

i'm homeless, so i was able to go to the library to check my ebt balance, and find out what happened. 

i'm just really upset and scared, and i have no cash benefits, and my options are to just wait another month, as i doubt dpss is gonna reimburse me. 

i don't know what to do, but fuck people who do this. i guess i have to be on hold for twenty fucking years, to get them to lock my card, and beg for them to put the benefits back.

i hate being black and gay and homeless, and i have nothing, thanks to those assholes, and shit for brains who did this.

"landlord has a second tenant | does ebt or foodstamps prefer smaller grocerstore or bulk shopping? i have an apartment that's part of a house, i lease the apartment. both property uses the same address. when i filed for benefits in texas, i was told despite the landlord living in property( in the house) they did not have to be a part of my case. just found out the landlord is renting a room in their house. that person is also getting benefits. landlord mentioned it to me. because we use the same address will i have to call and report a change? i'd hate for a system to pop up saying multiple people at an address has benefits and no one said anything. i'd just hate to get penalized for living in a house, ( even though it's the apartment). i'm  just conflicted on what the proper etiquette would be. thank you for anyone's assistance.

i'm in texas,  i have access to sam's club,  and feel like i can make my stamps stretch more that way,  rather than going through the little grocery store.  but i didn't want it to look bad on my account.  is that even a thing? i try to find the best deals i can because the least couple of years have been hard. i know there's rules on if the food is hot,  it can not be bought.  i have deep freezers and storage stuff so i'm not worried about that. just worried that my caseworker might question why i'm shopping in sam's."

our nephew just turned 18. he is currently staying where he can when he can in butte county. i recently tried taking him to dmv to get an id, to get a job. but he doesn’t have proof of residency, i thought i could just vouch for him. i was told i can’t because i’m not listed on his birth certificate. the dmv person was completely unhelpful in what we could do beyond telling us we needed one of the listed items to use as proof of residency. the approved items are not anything a homeless unemployed kid have, which is why we wanted to get him an id. also, neither of his parents are in the picture, at all. at the time i googled some things and found a form, i forgot the name, i could get through a case worker. which lead is to applying for cash aid, food stamps and medical. all would help him and he could get him an id, to help himself out. we completed everything online for butte county. a few days later he got a call from placer county, long story short, at some point his mother had him on her ‘case’ in placer county. he spoke to the person, i only have what he told me. he was told to contact his mother to have him removed from her case. as i said he is no contact with her, we also don’t speak with her. here is my question, how do we go about getting him off of her case without her?

i figured i'd come her and see if this was a normal thing, or to get any advice because he needs food and i'm not sure how worried to be. from what i understand it's a ""big no no"" to buy him food while he's on the program, so i don't wanna mess that up if his benefits are just late.

"is this the right determination | snap discounted amazon prime is a lower tier. | ineligible address? we are in pa. two people, over 67 , receiving ss, our total monthly income 2300 . i am disabled.our total costs for medical, taxes, utilities, insurance 1500 monthly.
after extra pandemic payments they have determined that we will get 129 a month .
does that sound right?

two years ago, i applied for and received the discounted amazon prime for being a snap recipient. 

in the last year or so i have been noticing that shipments are getting slower. in asking others, including my wife who has had her own full price prime acct., how long she waits for a shipment to arrive, everything is much faster. so we did a test order. there was an item that i needed for my daughter, this on december 11th.  i checked the estimated delivery date, december 20th.

my wife did the same order on her account , delivery date december 13th. it came on the 12th.

so my conclusion is that we get a lower tier prime account if getting a discounted prime.

not that i want to waste our snap benefits on amazon, but there are a few small items that i would have to drive too far to purchase. 

the issue i am having is that everything i have tried to purchase comes up as ""ineligible address for snap/ ebt"". 

i have a physical address and a po box, due to not having mail delivery at my location.

any thoughts on this?"

i submitted renewal for my snap benefits last month. renewal deadline is the 28th of this month. the status of the renewal still says sent. i was curious how long it would take to get approved? the deadline is days away and didn't want to miss out on next month's benefits.

so instead i submitted my documents through the online portal that i make over the max income limit because i get $450/week in gross income from unemployment and calfresh is still sending me benefits even though i submitted the paperwork hecka long ago. so i’m confused. does that mean i can continue using the benefits?

i received this and it says: “as of 10/01/2023, the county is changing your calfresh benefits from $101.00 to $291.00.

here's why:
the deductions you are allowed have changed. you cannot get the deduction when you are no longer billed for the expense.
the expense you no longer have is, housing.

the deductions you are allowed have changed. you cannot get the deduction when you are no longer billed for the expense.
the expense you no longer have is, utilities.

your calfresh household size is 1. your irt is $1,580.00.”

 i been living in a homeless shelter with my fiance and my 2 kids since may 6, but we finally got approved to stay here about 1 month ago. i want to mention that im not in the worst position financially, i work a 9-5 monday-friday and have a decent savings. we never struggled with food or any essentials like diapers/clothes etc. the reason why i became homeless was because i could not find an apartment in time and the person whos house we were living at decided they wanted us to go. no bad blood there i completely get it, having 4 extra people intruding your home daily doesnt sound fun.we were told to leave, and ended up going to path in the bronx. i been applying for apartments on my own daily, and i either get no responce, or get 2 specific messages. 1. that unfortunately they are looking to rent to someone who makes 40x the monthly rent anually, and 2. that its too many people wanting to move to the apartment (4 of us to a 1 bedroom cause thats all i can afford). 

our case worker told us that we need to pursue a housing voucher, made it seem like it was mandatory to pursue. i still do not know for sure if i have to mandatory pursue it while being in a homeless shelter, but to avoid any issues with evicting us we went ahead and followed instructions. she told us we must apply for cash assistance in order to have an open case. the goal was that wether we get denied or approved (denial was the likely scenario since i do have a savings), that it would lead to us having an open cash assitance case which is needed in order to pursue a housing voucher from ""nycha"" or in this case ""cityfeps"". the thing is now they want my fiancee whom im living with in this homeless shelter to file for child support. i provide for both my sons and my fiancee as far as my financing allows. we all have everything we need, we never go hungry, we all have propper clothing. she nor me have anything to complain about aside from our housing situation. 
i have been saving to build a security nest for when i do have an apartment im able to afford minimum 6 months of rent or more in case i lose my job or something happens were i cant work. just for security reasons.
my fiancee is the head of household at the homeless shelter, when we first showed up to path i asked to be the head of household i was told i couldnt be. now cash assistance is sending her applications and giving her child support appointments even after providing residency proof that we are all together at this homeless shelter.

what are my options here?can i be put on child support even if i live with my fiancee and both our kids? is there anyway i can avoid being put on child support? my fiancee doesnt want to because it makes no sence to, we are together and we are happy and im providing for all their needs. cash assistance was only done because our case worker told us we have to for a housing voucher. they mailed us applications for both the kids and given her an appointment they want her to go to for child support labeled ""mandatory"". i dont know how we should proceed with this. any advice would be appreciated."
"have you had trouble applying for food stamps in california? hi all, my name is jackie botts and i'm a journalist who covers economic inequality. i've been reporting on access to calfresh and i'm currently writing a story about difficulties people have applying for or staying on the program.

have you had trouble applying for calfresh or been discontinued for some reason even though you believe you're still eligible? i'd like to hear about your experience. feel free to comment below, dm me or email me at [jackie@calmatters.org](mailto:jackie@calmatters.org).

any help with ohio benefits? i submitted an application for benefits and then tried to call to see about my appointment time. the first time i was on hold 45 minutes and it hung up. the next time i was on hold an hour and a half and i never got through. does anyone have any advice for what to do? is there a certain number i need to call so i can actually get through? thanks.
"need advice for alabama foodstamp application hello all! just discovered this subreddit, and so glad it’s here, as i now don’t feel as alone.

so without getting too much into things i’ll try to make it somewhat concise (please don’t be mean to me because i’m from alabama i promise i’m different than ignorant people and please don’t be mean in general, for i am  hormonal :) )

i am a pregnant stay at home mom, living by myself.
i don’t have income right now, and rely on help here and there from people, little bit of money i had, etc. the father of both my children has been paying for the water and power for us to live in his family home instead of child support.

my question is: 1.) it asks me if anyone pays part, or all of the bills. should i put his name? and if i do, what does that mean: do they count that as income for me? 2.) would it be better to have him send me money for child support instead of the bills diapers thing? do they count child support as income? 

i have more questions, but i’ll start there. like a lot of others i see, i have to reapply basically now for march. they didn’t send me anything, but it says reapply online. i t gives me so much anxiety because i desperately need the help, more than ever. i think most people do, which is what’s so crazy about the timing of all this.


to much info to follow, just need to share. maybe someone will relate?
i also just want to say: i want to get back to work. i am tired of having nothing. i feel stuck because i don’t have family to watch him, i don’t have a car, he was unexpected, and then now his brother is and i was on birth control and took it regularly. i thought about taking abort pill , but it is illegal here and i’m glad i didn’t, for obviously  i am happy about it, just scared and confused. 

thank everyone"
"ny, parents snap benefits seem low? i applied for my parents snap benefits and they got approved for $207 a month. they both don’t work right now and my dad collects disability($500) and my mom gets retirement ($700) a month. is $207 right amount for two people? or should it be higher? not sure if i messed up something on the application."
"i sent a snap application last week | snap application | do i qualify for food stamps ? (tx) how long would it take a application sent on 12/20/2022 to be seen i called already but every time i do the line disconnects and i’ve  sent in all my info and am waiting for a phone call to see if i could receive benefits

( texas ) so i had recently applied for snap as a college student and am worried of getting denied i work more then 20 hours a week usually but in the pay stubs i had sent it showed a little bit lower then that cause i had went home for the holidays and i feel like i could use the help a lot more cause idk how tight money would be considering it’s one of my last semesters and working might be more hard cause of my studies

i make roughly 800-900 a month, rent is 600, gas usually 50-100, gym fees 30, the rest is usually spent on food i work about 20-25 hours at my job it’s h-e-b(grocery store) and i’m in college so i only work part time but it’s still hard to get scheduled because there’s a lot of people in the department

edit: (i’m from texas)"
"can't renew food stamps they sent me a letter saying it was time to reapply, so i did (online). a month goes by and they say ""since we didn't hear from you, benefits are ending.""

"how exactly does renewal work - ga about a month ago when i was suppose to get my april benefits, i logged into my gateway account and saw that my case was closed because i missed the renewal date. for clarity the mailboxes for my apartment were trashed because of vandalism so until they're replaced all my mail is held at the local post office which is 6 miles out from where i live and i don't have a car to visit there on a regular basis. 

   i have it set up where i'm suppose to get both physical and email notices, but i never received an email and thus missed the renewal date. the notice said that i can still send in a renewal application within the 30 days of the snap case being closed so i did that day on the 7th, a friday, and the letter i received after said that it'll start processing it on the 10th of monday. the letter said that it'll take up to 30 days to process and that i should expect a phone call from my case worker for extra information and that's the last i've heard of anything since. 

   i've tried calling, but it's all machines and no one is available to pick up. i've tried going to the offices, but they're either closed for that day or no one is seeing anyone unless you have a prior appointment, which i can't get because i get nothing but machines and busy lines. it's coming up on the 30th day since i've hit submit and i still haven't received a call or been able to get in contact with a human at the offices. i'm just getting a bit anxious about this because i've had to blow through my savings to put food in the house and now we're on two months without that needed support and it's starting to get tight. so i'm just wondering if the process is normally this long? is there a way to speed this process up? to get a hold of someone to know if my case was even looked at? will the benefits just be there on the 10th? i understand this service is understaffed and people are trying their hardest to work with a broken system but it's really stressful to be kept in the dark like this."
"calfresh ebt reimbursement skimming [california] my ebt card was skimmed stolen of all my benefits 2 weeks ago.  one day after the skimming incident, i went to the social service department and they filled out the ebt2259, was give a new card and pin. i was told i should receive a reimbursement in 10 days. it has been 14 days, im not sure if i should go back or wait some more. i have not received an email or letter regarding a status update. has anyone recently experienced a longer wait time for reimbursement ? this is in los angeles county, california.

saving your ebt funds and not using it all monthly. is it allowed? can you not use and save your funds in ebt or will the county take it back if they see you’re not using all of it? i get the inactivity issue but if you purposely want to save abs not use it all they can’t just take it back could they?
"nyc snap reapply? i submitted documents (address, identity, composition, etc) on the hra app multiple times before the deadline and i got a notice that snap was discontinued because of lack of address. after calling them, they told me i can reapply or go for fair hearing. however, it’s easier for me to reapply since i can put one more person on the case. my question is: the website says my case is active but the snap representative i talked to said my case is closed. should i reapply now or wait until the website says my case is inactive?"

"snap asking for information not in interview/case wondering if snap verification has asked for information you did not give in initial interview/case. 
after turning in all of my documents and getting approved for snap benefits, i receive a letter saying i need to provide proof of bank accounts. the accounts in question are a cashapp and venmo account. 
i personally do not have a cashapp or venmo account and provided them with my banking information from december 1st from my navy federal account. i was told someone reviewing my case went through my transactions and saw deposits from a cashapp and venmo, around $25 a deposit. 
are they allowed to go through bank transactions? as far as i know they are only suppose to look at the amount in the bank account on december 1st. 
these deposits came from my moms accounts she has specifically for my children in times of need or holidays. these deposits are not consistent and not monthly. 
just wanting input. seems like invasion of privacy to go through my bank account statements and ask about accounts i never verified in initial interview.

"is income updated for food stamps with medicaid renewal? | do health insurance premiums deducted from check lower income counted for food stamps? 
my families next renewal for food stamps is due in june, but i have a badgercare renewal coming up sooner. i’m wondering if that will affect our eligibility for food stamps if our income has increased, or if they don’t pay attention to that when doing a renewal for only badgercare. at the bottom of my last renewal it states this:

“because your total income exceeds 130% fpl for your foodshare group size and you remain eligible, you do not have to report any changes until your next review or six month report form.”

thanks

when determining eligibility do case workers count income before or after health insurance premiums are deducted from check? our income will likely be too high to qualify pretty soon, but we’ll also be having to sign up for my husbands employer offered health insurance. i wasn’t sure if these premiums that are deducted from his check weekly made any difference when they calculate eligibility. (wisconsin) thanks!"
"never got ebt card but have to repay the overissued hey guys! as the title said, my mom applied for calfresh or food stamp in ca in 2020. but she never got the ebt card in the mail. apparently they overissued the money for her card and asked for it back. but the thing is she never receive the card in the mail, let along using the money. i have talked to her social worker (i don't think she knows how to do her job because someone from calfresh said she input wrong info for my mom) about the issue and she said my mom won't owe anything as she talked to her boss and her boss talked to the higher up. i called to confirm last year and there is no debt or reliable as calfresh will recall all the overissued money and unused money back. nevertheless, my mom just got a mail saying she is reliable for more than 2,000$ and the case has been transfered to the tax collection department of the county... what should i do?

ps. i called them last year and they inspected her history. the card is brand new, money is still in there, no purchase history whatsoever"
texas food benefits and medicaid does anyone know if you virtual school your child are you exempt from the workforce working rules ?
do they just take it all? i have about 200 in my account as i've been very sick the last 2 weeks and not eaten anything. say i start a job in a few weeks and i have a balance no matter how small or large.
"florida dcf line won't answer hi, long story short i was homeless for 3 months, during which my phone ended up breaking and i had no access to internet, transportation, even a shower half the time as the small town i was in had a small shelter that was overwhelmed. i made it very clear to the dcf lady who called me for my interview that i was homeless, i had no address, no home. could not make it more clear. well a month ago my cousin let me move in with her and her husband. so i've been spending this time just now getting back on my feet. i start a job in 2 days and have never felt so relieved. 

my foodstamps card gets refilled today and i find it's empty. i log into my account to see any flags on me and i see i have received a ""3rd non-compliance notice 2 days ago"". i do not exaggerate when i say this will completely ruin me. without spilling family drama my cousin broke up with her husband(his house) days after i moved here. he's a nice dude and i've been helping him through it, keeping the house clean, but the bills are obviously becoming a stresser. there is no food in the house anymore so i was looking forward to today.

i just don't understand why she put me down for a work program and did not notify me(i don't want to be stereotypical but she was quite rude in the interview and the whole thing felt rushed). i can see right on my action notice pdf that being homeless is a cause for exemption. did she just somehow override it or was it just missed? i have been trying to contact dcf through the phone number 1-866-762-2237 and the line just tells me ""all of our agents are busy, try again later"". i feel like its just going to keep telling me this all day and i'm so distraught. i just need to know if i can get this appealed at all? life the past year has just been so rough and i can't lose this lifeline i so desperately need. am i wasting my time trying to contact them? 
thank you."
"will wa state actually contact my employer? hi, i just moved to wa state and and am looking to apply for food stamps. i work a part time job where i get paid cash, so i don't necessarily have pay stubs or official documentation of payment. will the state actually contact my employer? i just don't want to cause him issues or stress because of my situation"
"anyone still waiting on an application? texas- it’s been almost 3 months since i applied, benefits app still just says sent. called and had it escalated, but that’s taking just as long. anyone else having to wait an absurd amount of time?"
"ohio extra allotment | recertification does anyone know the deposit date for ohio's emergency allotments? i thought it was today but i have not received anything yet. i did have my renewal verified and granted this morning. thank ya!

i'm going through my recertification for snap right now, in ohio. as of august i'm no longer making an income with doordash due to a broken down vehicle, so my current income is zero. they want a written statement from whomever has been helping pay my bills.. i have had little help from a friend to get me by to this point. is this a normal document that is needed? are they going to contact him for his income and information?"
"just called the md hotline to check my ebt food supplement balance, was told by the automated voice that i have $21 in cash on my card? at first i nearly had a heart attack thinking i only had 21 on my food stamp balance, but then it went on to say what my food supplement balance was (it was enough for what i need to get from the store. phew). i've never had cash assistance on ebt (i have other benefits, like ssi), so i'm a bit confused as to where this money came from. i haven't received a mail update to any changes pertaining getting cash benefit ebt. is it a glitch in the system or am i free to spend it, and are there any stipulations on what i can spend it on?

also i found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/hq71tu/why_do_i_get_cash_benefits_on_my_ebt_card/) three year old post on this reddit about something similar happening to someone in washington state, but the article linked in one of the answers as an explanation seems to have changed to a page about policy research, so i'm still at loss"
illinois is giving extra food stamps for april and may i'm getting 194 dollars instead of 74 dollars a month.i heard rumors on the bus a few weeks ago. this might be happening.then i was getting low on money and remembered what i heard.came here and read texas was getting more.so i go look at the illinois dhhs web site. type in & i see they added 120 more of food stamps in my account a few days ago
"il snap balance website missing is anyone else in illinois unable to find anywhere to check their snap balance online? i can't remember the name but there used to be a website i'd go to, plug in my numbers and password real quick, and i could see what my current and pending balances were. as of like a week or two ago that site has started acting like it doesn't exist, i get that weird error when i try to reach the url, and when i google online snap balance like i always did before, nothing besides the official website/phone number comes up. i'm so confused and hate making phone calls, especially bc it's not always feasible when i need to check my balance. i hope i'm just being blind..."
"california ebt remaining balance my ebt benefit ended on jan 1 and i still have 2k in the card. i could not use a lot of my balance monthly as i can only use it for food in the supermarket. i could not use it to pay for any household essential or even in restaurant, so it keeps rolling over. i read some posts saying the unused balance will expire in 9 months after issuance, some posts saying it will expire after 9 months of inactivity. i live in ca and use the ebt card weekly.

i am a bit confused. my question is when will my ebt remaining balance expire? will i get any notification before any balance expire?"
"does pregnancy affect family size? (ma) i am in ma with me (sahp), husband (self employed) and 3year old. i think we receive the maximum benefit for a family of 3, currently according to pebt rules, but our income will likely qualify us for the maximum benefit amount whenever that comes back in to play. 

husband filled out the application, so i don't know if it asked if anyone in the household was pregnant (and i wasn't when we applied in oct '21). due in august. should we report this pregnancy (is it even relevant) or do we just update our case when baby comes? thanks."
"can a legal immigration applicant get an ebt card? i've searched their website but couldn't find any information about it. the info i found is ""people who get immigration approval can benefit"".

but i have just applied for immigration and my court is still pending. (in fact it hasn't even started, my first trial was in july 2023).

i am an immigrant who currently has no home, no job, living on the street. i came from one of the middle east countries. if this type of assistance is being given to people living in california, i would like to take advantage of it.

can i apply for an ebt card? i live in los angeles, which offices can i apply for?"
"applying for snap has become utterly pointless my father retired and i helped set him up to apply for food stamps so that he can receive benefits. they’re giving him only $23 a month. 

this is a man who has worked since a teenager and retired nearing 70. he’s been working minimum wage all his life. sacrificing his body to provide. what does the program do? give $23 in food assistance in a country where food has become a luxury than a necessity. 

what the hell is this? 

i’ve read some people getting $200+ a month for food assistance, but i can’t seem to understand how. 

if you have a household of 4 people, why give $23? if you only apply with a household of 1 person, why is it still $23? 

it’s a broken system. and let’s say you have 4 people in the household. 2 of them (kids ages 18+) end up getting letters saying they need to participate in some e&t program. a program that’s mandatory to serve 80 hours a month in order to keep the food assistance of $200+. 

like what? those kids are in college or just live there. why does it matter? why does it also matter if the father is using food assistance to continue to provide his family? he’s retired. he needs the help. how else is he going to get money aside from what he gets from retirement that is all used to pay bills? 

i’m just ranting at this point. i’m sorry. i’m just frustrated and needed to vent.

florida btw."
"calfresh/ ebt overpayment hello,

i have a question regarding my calfresh ebt/snap benefits. i started receiving calfresh snap benefits in september of 2020 after being laid off due to covid. i was finally called back to work at the end of june 2021. i tried contacting my caseworker but was never able to get a hold of her, so i mailed the information that i was starting up with my job again.

now i'm in september 2021, i havent used the ebt card since i started working end of june because i thought that because i mailed them my info/income that i would be making, that my benefits would stop. but i get an email asking me to "" renew my application so my benefits do not stop."" the next day, i get a call from a case worker asking if i could complete my renewal application over the phone. i tell her that i am not eligible for calfresh benefits anymore because i am working. she asks me to complete it anyway so that i am confirmed denied. stupid me, i quickly try to get it overwith because i am at work. i answer her questions and even confirm my income that i've recently made from my job for the last 4 weeks.

few days pass by i get an email to check my enotices on calwin. i havent logged in a while at this point because i have not been utilizing my ebt card and thought i stopped my benefits. i log in and see that i have still been receivng benefits after june when i reported my wages! i check the enotices, and  see the letter of denial as expected, but i also see this enotice (please see attached).

has anyone else received this enotice or know what it means? am i being investigated for fraud? or is it just a notice that they checked my work records just to determine my eligibilty? it really sucks that i am finding this out on a weekend because i have to wait until monday to call a caseworker and get this straightened out. it's making me kind of anxious having to wait. if anyone has the answer or can put me at ease, i would greatly appreciate it.

"never applied but got an ebt card in the mail - virginia i'm self employed not really making much. i'm married to a healthcare worker. i'm legal with my taxes but my above the line contribution to the joint income is very low.

my middle school child's whole school received free lunches last academic year. we think that might be where this came from.

yesterday i got an ebt card in the mail? it's in my name (51m) but mentions school lunches and has directions for creating a pin. calls itself a p-ebt card. my wife says it's an ebt card and might have money. i'm cautious. i don't want to take money and later have them ask for a lump sum return.

it's really tempting to use it as i would be buying groceries on credit card this month (bad idea but it's where i'm at).

advice?

edit: i looked up the p-ebt program for school kids and understand it better now. will use the money on food for the kid."

"does moving counties/households count toward overpayment? hi folks! i'm a student that recently graduated college back in may so i moved back to my home county (all in california.) i was receiving calfresh benefits since i was living in campus apartments with no income. when i moved back i was still receiving benefits but i did not use them, and my sar-7 recertification was scheduled for this month. i got a call today from my case worker who asked why my mail was being returned to the sender and that's when i notified them that i had moved back in may and that the old address was no longer valid (please note she did not ask for my current address.) the connection was pretty bad but she said that she would close my case and that i could still use the balance. the call ended there but i am currently worried because 1. i know i neglected to report the move and subsequent income change since my parents work (as opposed to my then roommates who also had calfresh) and 2. the balance is obviously quite large since i hadn't touched it since may, so if i use it and the county somehow determines it was an over-issuance, will i have to pay all of it back?  would anyone recommend just leaving the balance alone in that case? 

would appreciate help <3 thanks!"
"will i get penalized? help! hello everyone! i’m currently a recent college graduate (may 2023) living in ca. i applied for benefits while i was enrolled in college and living on my school off campus apartments. i applied using that address. but after graduating, i moved out of the apartments i applied under and the had a summer job that offered housing and then moved back home. i currently reside somewhere that isn’t even in the county i applied under. i am so scared. i read that i could be charged either 250k and then possibly go to prison?! the gag is is that at the summer job, the kitchen would be locked all the time and i wouldn’t have access to food all the time so ebt did help for me to get food. i really don’t know what to do. help? also! i got an email about a recertification interview for today but was never called?"

"calfresh for students - rude caseworker hi all,

i have been on calfresh under the covid-19 exemptions for a little over a year now. my first application and interview were a breeze and my documents with my financial aid were satisfactory. i had to reapply due to a sar 7 issue and my new caseworker is rude to say the least. i was under the impression that student financial aid is not considered income. but she got snappy with me asking how i paid my bills without income and i said i pay them with my aid. she said, ""well that's income"" with all sorts of attitude. has anyone here had a similar experience? i get cal grant b, pell grant, and have an efc of $0 in sacramento county."

"got accepted into college! - ca hi guys, i hope you all are well! 

i have officially accepted my admission for an undergraduate bs program in my area. i have received my financial aid package and i will be receiving both the pell and the state university grant. it totals to about $6k.

$3500~ of the $6k will go towards tuition and the rest (i think) will go to me so that i can use it for books and additional costs of the bs program. 

do i have to report that i will be getting financial aid? do i have to have the financial aid department fill out paperwork to send to my caseworker? 

i anticipate that i will still be working and going to school full time, does that disqualify me from getting snap?

i want to try and get all the paperwork all ready and filled out (if necessary) before i call my caseworker so that i can just call once. wait times are insane and with my schedule for work, i don't always have time to wait the extensive wait times.

i am here in ca. april will be the re-cert time, which they will notify in march. we dont want to re-cert . should we select (stop calfresh) in the month of april? or do you just not respond, and let it close out by its self. no point in being on the program since we only qualify for $23.. we are elderly and i understand the extra allotment infusion will end in feb. and roll out march?

i was reading on the usda calfresh for ca and it was showing that if people who qualify for calfresh and if it under $95 households would recieve that along with the max allotment... i dont understand how my case as a 73 senoir on ssa got missed for the $95 . i know it a lot of other calfresh cliants got thiers , is the $95 emergency alloment distrubed at the county level or state level like ea calfresh, thanks in advance on your information , i am new to this program

does anyone who is a calfresh expert .. know when the pandemic allotment come's to a close, do they also plan exclude people that are seniors who got in at the 200% poverty level. will all the pandemic rules change once the feds, and ca governor end pandemic policy . 

has there been any meetings of how this will change down the road, and will they send out notices of changes to calfresh recipients ..thank in advance

i am hoping this gets cleared up when i call them but am so stressed out trying to figure out what to do through the month. i don't mind having to go to a food bank occasionally to get help but cannot imagine having to do it every month. i feel as though other people deserve it more but will go if i need to.

"ca alameda calfresh: will they call your landlord to verify rent before an interview? don't want landlord to know i'm on benefits i just applied for calfresh through [https://www.getcalfresh.org/](https://www.getcalfresh.org/en/faq) (ca, alameda county). i provided photos of my lease agreement and screenshots of venmo transactions to verify my rent amount.

now, i'm worried that they will call my landlord to verify my rent amount for calfresh, and that this will let my landlord know i'm applying for benefits. (i don't want to give my landlord any reason to question my income, since my lease renewal is coming up.)

since i just applied, i don't have an interview date or anything like that. my landlord's name is visible in supporting documents, but not their phone number.

does the alameda office actually track down and contact your references just based on your application alone, before interviewing you or getting consent for doing so? do they need your consent to contact references? or am i worrying unnecessarily?

if they do contact references, then how do i withdraw my application?

"overissuance hey everyone,

so i’m in a bit of a pickle. i recently received a letter in the mail saying i owe $800 to calfresh. which is interesting because i have never applied for or had food-stamps in my life. after calling and digging around i discovered that it is because my mother who passed way in 2019 named me on there back in 2015 (when i was 19 and she was living with me) i had no knowledge of this and never signed or received any sort of benefits in my name. apparently she had a hearing in june of 2019 which she obviously missed because she died in may of 2019. the lady i spoke to at calfresh basically told me “i know this sounds messed up but they don’t care that your mother is deceased, you were a part of the household so you are legally liable for the overissuance” & that basically all i can do is hope that the judge overseeing my hearing on the 25th understands the situation and doesn’t make me pay it. this has all been so incredibly frustrating and stressful. does anyone have any advice or has ever dealt with something like this?"

man this sucks. every time i call the office, all i hear is ""keep checking it there are delays in ny its just waiting for my senior to sign off on stop calling because i cant tell you why you haven't gotten a deposit yet"" 

like well thanks. maybe put me through to your senior then? its getting close to christmas and i havent recieved decembers benefits. not one deposit. my case file is active and wasnt cancelled or denied it just hasnt showed up. is there anything i can do about this? its getting me anxious as hell because im not in a position right now to be able to actually have more than onr days worth of food in my house. this sucks.

so im supposed to recieve my food stamps on the 5th every month and i still havent recieved my deposit yet. i caĺled my local office and all they could tell me is that im still qualified and that im not discontinued just that theyre ""experiencing delays"" and to just keep checking. this is pretty damn inconvenient giving i just paid my electric and rent and am broke and desparetely was hoping on my deposit to be on time."

"pennsylvania..nobody called for the scheduled phone interview | (pennsylvania) i’m uncomfortable sending in bank account statements then i get a message the next day that i missed the interview and benefits will stop if i don’t reschedule. called the cao twice and left messages but no responses. there is no email, website message system to actually confirm they get my voicemails. i understand they are probably backlogged but i would like some sort of confirmation.

i sent in paystubs and any changes through the pa compass website and the app. i work during the week and told them so on my messages and a good time to call.

my benefits are up for renewal in december. i finished the online application through the pa compass website and the amount of documents they want this time is really crazy. i stated i have some health issues (they did ask) then i had to screenshot my last doctor appt. summary to prove i have these ailments. also all utility bills i paid  and even a renters insurance paper but then they didn’t want my lease agreement which is the biggest expense of them all.

but what i’m really uncomfortable with is sending in my bank account statement along with my 18 year old child’s statement too. his money has nothing to do with me, it’s all his and he’s in college full time now. i feel like it’s nobody’s business when i got gas or maybe a bottle of wine at the state store. am i being unreasonable or just send it in and shut up about it? maybe it’s covid and all the extra money going out that they want to check everyone with a fine toothed comb. i used to send in a few paystubs and it was a done deal."

"if i get food stamps, would i be taking the resource from someone more in need? i'm in dc and i am a college student living in a house with some siblings, and i wanted to sign up for snap. i have a job and relatively low living expenses, but i figured if there was a resource i am eligible for that would lower those expenses so i could put more towards saving up and all that, then i should look into it. i wanted to make sure that by signing up, i wasn't draining the resource for a more in-need family. i'm a big fan of community resources like the library and stuff like that and wouldn't want to do something that jeopardizes the use of people with a more severe need.

"be aware of scams impacting ebt cardholders hoping this can get pinned for visibility.

please be aware of phishing and skimming schemes that have increased significantly in volume across the nation in recent months. protect yourself and your card because snap funds are not replaceable in most states due to federal rules.

***skimming*** devices placed on atms and points-of-sale (where you swipe your card, including grocery and convenience stores) record your ebt card number and personal identification number (pin). that information is then used to create a copy of your card (called a *clone*), which is then used to withdraw cash funds or make snap purchases from your account. 

**protect yourself from** ***skimming***. do a quick scan before using any machine, take a look to make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.  check the keypad or swiping device (called an *overlay*) to see if it's loose, if the numbers are hard to press, or if anything else looks suspicious. **change the pin** **to your card** as often as you can, and use a different pin each time.

***phishing*** schemes begin with an email, phone call or text message to cardholders telling them that their card has been 'blocked' or that there is some other problem with their card. the messages provide a phone number or other way in which you are asked to provide your ebt card number, pin or other personal information. these messages and the phone numbers they ask you to call can look and sound **very similar to ones you receive from your snap agency but they are fake** systems designed to steal your information. 

**protect yourself from** ***phishing***. do **not provide your** **pin to anyone, ever**, including your snap agency or caseworker. your snap agency will not (and should not) ever ask your for your pin."

yesterday a caseworker called to let me know i was eligible for expedited food stamps and that i could get them tomorrow (today). after loggining into my compss account it now reads status closed/rejected expedited only. why would that be ? previous info if this is needed is i recently moved counties and i’m currently in school full time. i’m trying to get my son into daycare so i. can go back to work soon. is it because i’m not working yet that it is closed and i’m only getting 1 month of foodstamps ? the lady never mentioned anything about only qualifying for one month on the phone. any info would help!

i’m making less money now that they’ve cut my hours, is there a way i can report this income change to possibly recieve more?

hello,
i got a letter on september 27 saying my semiannual report is late is due on the 27th i immediately filled it out online and dropped off my paystubs to the building. since then, when i sign onto my compass account under benefits it no longer says i recieve food stamps. it told me to list a good reason on my report as to why it is late and i stated i never received notification that it was originally due. my next payment is supposed to be october 2 will i recieve it or will i have to completely reapply? will this effect my childcare subsidy as well?🤦‍♀️"

"calfresh overissuance, but have not spent ebt funds los angeles, california. my parents applied for calfresh this past fall because they were laid off. they used/spent the food stamp money they received for only a month (october) because they each found a job again. a week after they started work, they went in person to tell their case worker that they no longer needed food stamp assistance. they took their paystubs, and the caseworker told them to email her a copy of one paystub they forgot (i did that for them later that day). after two weeks, they hadn't received notice that their assistance would stop, so my mom called. the case worker had an attitude and said she didn't know about any mail or emails because she hadn't checked her mail in a month, and told my mom they would receive a letter when it's done. two weeks pass, nothing, so my mom calls again, and someone else tells her she can't connect her to her case worker because she's on vacation and no one else can look into my parents' case until she gets back. my mom got tired of trying and didn't go back in person because no one ever helps and it's frustrating.

now in february, after i figured out how to set up their online account, i can see that they kept receiving money from calfresh. it's about to 1k, now. i submitted the semi-annual report (sar 7) for them on feb 11 with the completed form and uploaded their paystubs (however, it says ""incomplete 2/14/20"" now under case status information).
i'm worried this will probably be considered overissuance, even though my parents alerted the office they no longer wanted assistance. they also stopped touching the money once they found their jobs. 

q: will they have to pay back the money, or can we expect that all the money on their ebt/calfresh account will be taken instead (and they won't have to pay out of their pocket)? 
thank you for your time for reading this."

"is orange county california following the $95 a month increase? does anyone know if the orange county calfresh agency is issuing the $95 emergency allotment instead of just raising the excess benefit to the maximum level?  i never got it and none of my neighbors who already got max benefits got it.  the workers at calfresh haven't heard about it either.

bassically, all year and last year everyone who was getting at least $1 in benefits was given enough pandemic extra ebt to get them to the maximum amount based on household size. 

&#x200b;

however, people who started off at the maximum amount, or who were less than $95 away from that amount were not getting the extra assistance that was supposed to happen when raising everyones amount.  

&#x200b;

so in april of 2021 the usda and biden (i think) addressed this issue by stating that every household was going to get at least $95 a month in emergency allotment.  if you were getting more because you had less benefits to start, then no big deal, however if you were getting less or none because you were already near or at max, you get $95.

  
it seems that the people in orange county haven't been getting it, or at least the workers i have talked to haven't heard about it.  


edit: clarification."

i wrote it off as a fluke, but when i went shopping for thanksgiving on the 18th of november, my deposit still hadn't been made for the month. i had to use cash (intended for bills) and pare down my shopping list. this is very weird because texas pays out from 1st to the 15th of the month and i can't find anything on their website, or in the news that says anything has changed.  


this morning, i checked and see i got the regular deposit on november 28th, monday. i didn't call to ask about it yet. but what the heck is with this???? it's difficult to plan when my last two deposits have been 2-3 weeks late with no warning and no explanation."

i applied for cash assistance in the beginning of february and finally got notified that i was rejected. i have had no income since the middle of january and can't pay rent this month or for groceries, etc yet i was rejected. i lived paycheck to paycheck.

does anyone have any advice on how to go about this? should i call them or go to the hra office? or reapply, etc.?

**edit:** after i waited 2 hours at the hra office to get chewed out by a woman rep dressed in cow print, i was told my application was rejected due to it being duplicate. that helped me in no way or provided any clarification. it was only when i opened the app after getting home and got a notification that i was approved for cash assistance and snap.

i'm in washington state. i recently found out that you could order groceries on instacart and pay with ebt. while going over the receipt to see the charges today, i noticed that i was charged for bags and a bag tax. if you guys don't know, any person receiving any type of public assistance is exempt from the bag fees and taxes.

when i called to speak to them, they said they do not offer refunds and that i needed to look at the fine print for this. hung up the call, then went to create an order to see the fine print. this is what it says: "" a bag fee may be added to your final total if required by law or the retailer. the fee will be visible on your receipt after delivery. ""

i called them back to ask again. the next person i got continued to tell me the same thing, however, after checking on the [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov) website this is what it says under exceptions:

* the fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), women, infants and children (wic), temporary assistance for needy families (tanf), or food assistance program (fap).

the person put me on hold, and then came back to tell me that upon review, they will give me a refund ""this time"" and all i needed to do was send them an email at the generic 'help' email address. if you have used this service, check your receipts."

a bit of background.

my mom is on social security and she is included in the monthly ebt allotment i receive.

i read that people receiving social security would receive an increase. however, she hasn't received hers yet.

no changes in income on my end.

my benefits expire in may 2023.

has anyone gotten this letter yet? what did it say?

for those who have not, what could they possibly have to say?

hi,

when i was approved for snap last june 2022, after i activated the link card, whenever i would call the automated system (number on the back of the card), i would hear the following message:

your snap balance is $\_\_\_

you are scheduled to received snap benefits on the 2nd of each month through may 2023.

i received a packet in the mail late april 2023 to renew benefits. 

i completed the form and mailed back. i called the manage my case number about 2 weeks later to make sure it was received. it was. the automated system asked for my case number and said i was approved.  i transferred to a case manager to be sure. sometime later, a caser worker called me to do an interview. after the interview was completed, i asked her what should i expect next? i was told that if i called back tomorrow (the following day) the system would say approved which it does.

however, when i check my snap balance (a different phone number/system than manage my case) for may, it just tells me the balance, it no longer says the date i am scheduled to receive benefits. i thought it should say the time frame i am scheduled to receive benefits (june 2023 to may 2024) and the date every month as i stated above.

could someone help me understand what happens next since i have been approved? does the money just automatically reload starting in june on the same day every month as before?"

hey everyone! here is what's going on. ok me and my boyfriend has 3 kids and he is buying a house we are living in, i applied for foodstamps because i lost my check (currently trying to get it back) but got denied because i guess he make to much. but about 2 weeks after getting denied i re applied because we split up and me and the kids are living in the house and he moved to his parents.  so the foodstamp office said they need hard proof showing he moved out like, change of address and 2 reference letters saying he moved out. but then she said make sure they are aware of the penalties 🤷‍♀️ so what i'm asking is are they going to come check out my house and make sure he isn't living here or something?"
doordash income reporting for snap i am a doordash driver looking to apply for snap benefits in north carolina. i'm unsure how to report my income and hours per week working as it varies pretty greatly. does anyone know how to report these numbers to receive benefits?
"confused on how to report?  terrified of breaking rules and getting in trouble or starting an investigation. i get food stamps for myself and my one year old. the dad is in the picture and works but we have lots of issues and my son and i end up moving out often and living with a friend or my mother in law frequently. i know it’s not a great situation but i’m trying to make it work. that being said, i can’t imagine reporting a change of address every couple of weeks or so and then it’s temporary. i also have to pay for everything for our son. especially when we’re fighting so i just starting paying for everything all the time so that i don’t feel money can be held over me. am i breaking the rules by saying we don’t like with him? i’ve tried explaining to a worker and they didn’t really help. just said that i don’t need to report changes ahead of them happening"

"can hours from a less than minimum wage job/internship could towards the work requirement for calfresh/ebt? edit: i am in la county :) 

i’m a disabled college student and it’s very difficult to convince someone to hire me for 20 hours a week. unfortunately, most minimum wage work isn’t wheelchair accessible? even if they legally have to be. if i take a low-paying internship, will those hours count?"
"ga snap hi! i was curious if i would be eligible for food stamps. i’m a college student, but i work roughly 20-24 hours a week as a baby sitter. that’s my only income as of right now. i get paid in cash. i have an interview today, but i’m afraid i will be turned away. i currently live off-campus and do not have a meal plan. is there any documentation that i need to have ready? i already turned in my lease, how much i pay in rent, and a recent utility bill proving i live where i do now (my mom’s address is on my license)."
"disappointed and annoyed: just received a delinquent/collections letter edit: this is los angeles, ca 


i'll try to sum this up as best as possible 

lost my job with pandemic. applied and was approved for $186/month. a month later i received a letter stating because of the unemployment $600 bonus i now only qualified for $16. so they said for the first month i how have to pay back the difference. 

it was a joke so i just stopped using it and figured they'd just use the balance i had to cover that. 

a month later i receive a letter saying i still need to pay so i called and spoke to my case worker and she they can't do that and i have to fill out a form to indicate i'm asking for my balance to cover that ""back pay"" 

so i did. this was last year in june  

today i received a letter saying now my case is delinquent/collections for $179. 

i no longer have ebt because it said it would expire and i had to reapply so i didn't since $16 wasn't enough and i'd rather leave that to someone else. 

**does this mean that balance i left purposely now vanished??**

so now my credit score is going to get messed up because of this ordeal? 

it's saturday so i can't call my case worker but i'm already preparing myself for her to not even give me the time of day to help and remedy this."
"help food stamp fraud i just found out my wife(we are sperating but still living together) has been illegally taking over 600 of food stamps per month. she never put me on the account last year when she was furloughed. i found out last year and she said she would stop. (i don't want to pay it back. we struggle but can afford food). she gave the card to her sister for a year because her adult son was living there. she just got it back i think a few weeks ago. i thought it was pebt for kids not in school but i checked and she's been taking it in.

what do i do? am i responsible for her fraud. i used it today thinking it was pebt but saw the total and confronted her. she became irate and denied it but i saw account with my eyes. she said the state screwed up but i'm calling bull."
arizona hi there i’ve received benefits for a year and now it was time for renewal. my application has not been processed and i already did my i interview. i submitted my application on 07/26 and i haven’t heard anything yet. i’ve been calling but all i get is the automated service. i can not reach a person to talk to. i have 2 kids and usually we get the food stamp drop on 8/07. so i’m currently running out of food. but my application isn’t being run through. i’ve called both numbers and i don’t know what to do next. on the website it is still under as waiting.
"new: walmart now accepts snap for regular shipping, not just store pickup and delivery, and shipping is free for orders over $35 this makes online grocery shopping with snap very similar between amazon and walmart. amazon's minimum for free shipping is only $25, or $35 for amazon fresh, while walmart has free shipping on orders over $35, and prices are lower than amazon on many items. (amazon also offers prime at half price for snap recipients.) i noticed this change very recently now that walmart has merged its online grocery shopping with the rest of its online shopping. i haven't seen any announcement about it yet."
il - filling for taxes seperated if we are *separated* but still file for taxes as married jointly. will this affect my wife's food stamps? she is unemployed and i am working. however we do not share income.
"would it be better to keep a bill at $30 or rise it to $50 so it can be reported to ebt? not sure if this is a dumb question but couldn’t find the answer online. basically our trash bill. used to be $28 a month so it didn’t meet the $35 threshold. that company is closing and there are two companies we found the replace it. one is $30 for weekly trash pick up and no bin and the other is $50 and we get recycling, yard waste, and a free 96 bin. i was wondering if anyone thinks paying more might be better because then the bill would be counted? our snap got pretty heavily cut so we are spending more on food but we would like to do recycling if we can fit it into the budget. 


thanks!"
"help applying i had applied for calfresh when i got into college, and so i waited for mail about if i was eligible or not. once i had actually gotten my mail i called them to ask about it and all the office said was that because i missed my interview i was no longer eligible and had to reapply. it was really frustrating so i’m trying to figure out what to do next. any tips on how to make the application process easier? should i just go to an office in person and apply then?"
case closed i need some help. i was waiting to hear back on my case. i checked the status and learned my case closed because i missed the recertification interview. i didn't realize. i was expecting a call. is there a way to reopen or some sort of grace period for a few days.  what do i do?

"what now?? so i recently lost kancare and snap. i've been fighting to get somebody to just send me in writing exactly what i need to turn in. due dates were once again changed last minute, contradicting phonecalls depending on who answers the phone... and at one point they even gave my case to someone in training 😐 i feel like my case has been thrown into a woodchipper and no amount of phonecalls will get anybody to just do it right. 

i have serious medical issues that limit my ability to work, and i would be more than happy to submit paperwork that proves that, but i have not received anything that requests/explains specifically what they want from me.
do i appeal or start over? how messed up does this have to get before someone does something about it?"

"interview (fl) | only $23? hello. i have a bit of a issue, i applied back in january, but when i did that the website for florida on my account was blank i couldn't see my notices or send in any pay stubs, fast forward to yesterday and i got denied because i didn't send in my pay stubs. can't send them in when the website was blank for a few weeks. so i reapplied again. send in my pay stubs since magically the website is back up.  called yesterday afternoon and had my interview, the lady was shocking nice, and said i'm all good to go. how long will it update to get my benefits.

i just don't understand this. im in fl live by myself. i put that i get ssdi and work part-time (weekly pay, that differs due to uncertain hours) and after putting rent of 1700 and other utilities i only get $23 in food stamps? that seems so low to me for one person alone.  it just doesn't seem correct."

"applied for food stamps 2 month ago in ny i applied for food stamps back on december 6th of 2022.

for context i gave them everything they asked for and i qualify. especially since i have 2 kids and i’m not working currently right now. 

i have tried reaching out to my local dss since mid december and everyone that i spoke to either transferred me to my case worker or said they would get the message to her. i haven’t heard from anyone. no letters stating if i’d been denied or approved. no phone calls or emails. 

when i check online it just says my application is submitted. 

as of today i got fed up and went in person to speak with my case worker. she came out and said that she would open the case today. she also stated that she received everything. 

i checked my card this afternoon and still nothing. 

what else can i do? i’m not understanding if they have all my information why i haven’t gotten my stamps yet, especially since my worker told me should would open it up today. 

just super frustrated. anyone else experiencing this?"
can i be unemployed and receive benefits? i cannot work a regular job due to some issues. i am currently studying on my own for a job that i can do from a computer at home. family member has been giving me money but i would like to get some food stamps bc it’s really hard getting by on what they give me. i plan to be able to go to work in the field i’m studying by next year. will food stamps require me to start work before that time? can i put the money family is giving me down as my income and not go to work? bc i won’t be able to work. idk what to do bc i need some help. state is ky
"received empty lone star card. in tx. quick question: i can’t seem to find an answer anywhere.

"for eligibility workers (arizona) has any eligibility worker felt burned out? i feel the burnout, i've had some tough cases but some were most easy, i had clients who were nice and some who were just straight out feel like they want their food stamps because they say they didn't want to get verification even though it's part of policy and i am always told that we cannot take their word for it.  i've even been told by a client that ""you are the one wasting my time"" when i am just doing what i am trained too. what would you guys do?

update 01: i was able to help a lady today get her ma, na and ca, she really appreciated that i was able to help her finish her case, though it took 2 hours to complete it since it was all three programs, she thanked me and was glad she was able to get someone who was nice and it felt nice not being rushed because they have plans to be somewhere."

"sil possibly roping me into fraud? facts are as follows: 
- sil is currently 9 months pregnant and has been on food stamps and cash assistance since month 1 of pregnancy. 
- her pregnancy is considered a high risk pregnancy and has worked in the past but goes on/off cash assistance and food stamps when her auto immune disease flares up and makes her unable to work. i am not 100% sure how it works but this is my general understanding of the situation. 
- sil has a history of low motivation to work consistently prior to the auto immune diagnosis. i don’t want to comment on the “truthfulness” of her disease because i don’t love it but take that info for what it’s worth. 
- sil’s boyfriend, the father of the baby, is not an official resident of the state they live in together but lives here full time. i live about 10 minutes away from them in the same state. 
- sil’s boyfriend does not have a job currently but is physically/mentally capable of working. doesn’t seem to have a plan right now for getting a job post baby either.
- sil is planning on continuing her  state benefits after the birth of the baby, not sure of her timeline or even the possibility of her going back to work post baby. 
- sil claims that in order to keep her checks coming post-birth, the boyfriend needs to pay child support through the state. 
- the boyfriends mother does not know her son is not working and sil/boyfriend would like to hide these child support payments from her. 
- in order for the boyfriend to pay child support through the state (so they can keep state assistance) without using his legal address (so boyfriends mother does not find out via mail from the state), sil tells me she needs to use my home address for the boyfriend. i own my home with my fiancé. 

questions for the sub -
1) is this how this normally works? i have very little knowledge of how the state assistance system works. i am not getting warm and fuzzy vibes from the possibility of my sil using my home address even though her boyfriend does not live with me. 

2) any advice on how to approach this situation? if this is not how things normally work what can i suggest to them instead (other than the obvious, boyfriend gets a job.)"

i work in retail and my estimated income is about 10k annually. since i'm under 22 i can't apply separately from my parents (which sucks because i buy my own food).

i'm not sure if my parents qualify, but they're poor and have 5 kids, so assuming they do, how does this work? my mom told me she doesn't want to apply because others need it more. would she need to use it or could only i? would i get a separate card if she added me? i don't know how food stamps work.

"get a free/cheap laptop ? | are vitamins covered by ebt ? hi there, 

i recently got my ebt card (california) 

i saw there is a program to provide free phone and sim card, is there something similar when it comes to laptops ?

i have magnesium deficit, so can i get that on ebt ?"
"please help me to understand the ebt statement. hi,

my father has the food stamp and he is asking me help to check how much $$$ he got for every month.

i created the account on the providers app andcheck the amount. 

i see there are 2 kinks of money add in to the account.
1 is benefit avail ( food), the other is benefit authorization (food).

for example on this mar:

03/05: benefit avail (food) + $300
03/14: benefit avail (food) + $90
03/14: benefit authorization (food) + $90
03/25: benefit authorization (food) + $300

so, doea that mean my father got total $780 on this mar.
and he get 4 benefits per month???

he told me that the previous months and usually just got $300-$400 per month. 

i am wondering that why he get double on this mar.

or am i not understanding well enough the statement balance meaning that showing on the providers?

thank you so much!!!"

"am i going to lose my snap benefits completely? i'm in north carolina. i'm disabled on ssi and i get snap. i recertified for snap in november, and they sent me a letter saying my monthly snap would now be $94 a month.

but as you probably know, starting in january, ssi and social security recipients got a large cost of living increase. personally, mine went from $841 a month to $914 a month. so $73 more per month in ssi.

snap sent me another letter at the end of december saying the cost of living increase may affect my snap benefits, but it didn't say by how much. it said i could check using the ebtedge app and clicking on the ""benefits tab"". but i downloaded the app and there's no tab like that in mine. i've clicked on basically every link in the app, and nowhere does it say how much i will be getting in january, or even if i'm getting anything at all. i can see my past benefit transactions, but nothing for the future. so now i'm scared that means that i've lost my benefits entirely because of the col increase. but wouldn't they send a letter specifically saying i'm no longer eligible?

is making $73 more a month from ssi enough to wipe out my snap benefits entirely?"
irt limit so i just had my review and i had an appointment to speak to my case worker. which they never called me. and then i checked online and it said my benefits were discontinued because my income is over my limit. which i’m confused about because my limit is less than my rent? i’m a full time student and i moved before this current semester and my rent expense significantly increased so i obviously had to work more and therefore i reported an increase in my income alongside my expenses such as rent. am i just out of luck now or is there something i can do?

"acceptance for snap in michigan for only $28? | food assistance disappeared? quick story, applied for assistance in october but was denied, knowing it was a mistake and took the route to re-apply instead of requesting a hearing, so the 2nd time we were approved for $28 a month after waiting another month but they made a mistake with our income (again), the approval showed how they calculated our income to give us the $28... they still had unemployment still in the system from the pandemic back in 2020 and did not take it out when we applied for assistance so they calculated our income (2,400 per month) and the unemployment (1400). i called today and they are leaving a note for our case worker to remove the unemployment, so i am glad that will be getting fixed. anyways, so i question is:

will they fix the mistake and adjust the $28 for the months of november and december and re-do it or will they fix the mistake and then in january we will get the correct amount in assistance? i would assume they will adjust the $28 from the previous months and even perhaps go back to the first application and go back to october but that's probably asking too  much, i wish there was a way to actually speak to my case worker again bc i call and they told me they don't do that anymore. anyway, hopefully this gets fixed..

so we got our 6 month review as i'm sure everyone did. i submitted it online, no issues the day i received the review, this was back in 3-3-23 is the day we submitted it, not due till 4/30. now fast forward 2 months, we were suppose to get our assistance today 5-3. said 0 balance, go to mibridges, and the food assistance under benefits is not there. has this happened to anyone else? the 6 month review was pretty simple it asked, did you have any changes if yes submit proof, if no just check here, we had no changes at all so selected no on all the answers, signed it and submitted it.

i am going to call up our case worker tomorrow but has this happened to anyone else? do we have to reapply now or can they go back and look i submitted our info, we got approved for $650 something so its not like we were getting the boost from the pandemic, we got approved for that.. so im not sure what is going on or what i have to do now."
texas snap missing deposit i was supposed to get my snap today. the website is apparently down but i’m having a hard time getting info on much else. i haven’t received my benefits and i’m just worried they aren’t coming. i really need them. does anyone have any info?
"college student food stamps hi, 

so basically here's my situation: i'm a college student in a work study who just got approved for food stamps, i'm working about 11 hours per week and i'm a full time student.

due to my federal work study balance, i'm going to run out of work-study funds in about 5 months, at which point my employer said i would be transfered from a ""work study"" to a ""part time employee"" and nothing else would change. 

my question is: i'm currently eligible for food stamps because i ""participate in a federal work study program,"" and i was approved for the entire year due to this. but, will i no longer be eligible after those 5 months? it's a bit confusing but any advice would be helpful."
"medi-cal income is wrong after applying for foodstamps. scared of getting in trouble. hi. ( california ) long story short, i applied for foodstamps in 2022 and got approved. however for some reason, they changed my income to 0.01. i called to correct it and they said because of phe they changed it to this so i wouldn't lose my medi-cal and that i will have to reapply with my new income next year ( 2023 ) however they also said they will adjust it for me. 

to add i did not reapply for foodstamps as my situation improved.

well 2023 comes around and i got a letter saying that i got reapproved for medi-cal at just $0.01 again being my income. i was expecting a renewal form, i freaked out, and i called to try to fix it. ( my income now does not qualify me for medi-cal ) they said i need to send in my income for the last 30 days. i emailed them july 1 and still haven't heard from them and my income ( looking at coveredca) hasn't changed. i started the report a change application but i stopped because i figured i should try to wait a bit to see if they will make the changes.. the worker i talked to said i should recieve a letter within a week but i haven't recieved one. 

also will i be in trouble? i'm self employeed and i forgot to report my income when it increase within the last year or so. :(( to be honest i just forgot.  my income fluctuates month to month so it makes it hard to really determined if it changes or if it's more or less the same. 

when i try to explain the situation, the worker i talked to said that the last 3 years doesn't matter and it's irrelevant before the of phe as they just want to know what i make now. 

now i'm just trying to figure out what to do. 
i don't want to get in trouble for the time i forgot to report a change, or for that fact that it says i only made 0.01 even though i wasn't the one who put that.

so i did contact them, did what they said, been 2 weeks and haven't heard anything. should i wait or make the change myself online?"
"i didn't update my changes fl i didn't update my changes.  i just hit next and reapplied as if i had no job.  i really wasnt thinking  when i did it because i thought it didntmatter and everyone was still just getting the max household amount ..  now i see the fraud investigation team (pbi) updated the info for me and cancelled my benefits. 

they also somehow knew the exact amount of hours i worked too.  could payroll or my boss have reported me, or does the state investigate and figure it out on their own?"
"any way to submit forms to dpss without having to call? (los angeles, ca) i had cash benefits stolen off my ebt card and need to submit a request for reimbursement (unfortunately this is the second time it's happened, so i already know the process). my question is, with the new [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) website, it seems like every time i upload anything i still need to call customer service or else no one ever sees it. with the old ""ybn/your benefits now"" dpss site, i never had to talk to anyone on the phone - documents that i uploaded, whether they were requested or not, always got processed. now, even when i talk to them and they specifically ask me to upload something, they tell me to call back again after i do so and let them know...

to me it completely defeats the purpose of uploading stuff online if i still need to deal with the customer service phone line hassle, so i'm wondering if anyone knows a way to get things to them (and into the processing pipeline) without having to call. if i were to mail the forms in, would that work? or is the only way to avoid calling by just going to the office in person? thanks."
"applying for food stamps as a college student with 7 other roommates in an apartment hello! it is a few days before me and my roommates move into our apartment near campus and i am slightly concerned about the food situation. so, i researched about getting food stamps in the state of **new jersey** and i know that if i applied by myself, i would be eligible since i am working during the semester under a federal work study job. the thing is that we might be sharing food together (we get along a lot last year) which would mean that i will have to include them in the application, right? would that affect the eligibility for food stamps? i know, for a fact, that some of them might not be working during the semester so i am concerned that if we shared food, i will not be approved for food stamps and i'm going to be on my own to get money for food. if that happens, would it be better just to get food and eat on my own with food stamps or eat as a group without food stamps?"

"food stamps in ga (and potentially other states as well) | dfcs in ga - cannot get anyone to speak to about my partners food stamps not being given when case is active and open/up to date. there appears to be a massive, massive backup of renewals and apps for food stamps that have not been approved. caseworkers have fallen off the face of the earth, my partner's case worker number is apparently disconnected so i guess she just doesn't work there anymore? 

regardless, there are news stories that have covered it but it was not made a bigger story or even brought to our attention, which is why virtually no one knew and i had to find out from a worker in a office that doesn't even handle that information or state agencies like that. 

i don't have any remendies for the situation, we're financially backed up now because i have to create a separate fund for food since he doesn't have any stamps right now and it's wrecked our budget and what little money i have left after rent and debts paid down. 

this may be the issue in other states besides georgia but i do know that's what we're dealing with now.

so, before its suggested to go in person, neither he nor myself own a car. 

we've e-mailed, called, everything we can possibly do to find someone to talk to. 

my partners ebt case is up to date, active, nothing missing or requested on gateway. no correspondence has been sent to him electronically or physically about anything regarding his account (we have informed delivery) or anything potentially wrong with it. 

he did not receive any food stamps for the month of june we cannot get in touch with anyone to figure out why. no phone calls, emails or mail have been sent his way once again. 

how the fuck do you talk to an actual person?? the main number keeps saying they have too many calls when you try to talk to customer service."
"texas food stamp fraud /residency i am wondering - my kids father is currently not working . the kids live with him because i travel frequently and have terminal illness that prevents me from being able to care for them. he is going to live with my parents till he finds a job. i do allow him to use my address because the schools in my area are in one of the best districts in the state. 
does food stamps verify where he lives? i got a letter in the mail for my daughter for pebt presumably because she goes to school near me.
he does not currently collect food stamps and hasn’t in years. he lost his job in october and is still looking . he hates asking for help but he needs to apply! 
anyone have some advice about food stamps verification? i am sure they think it’s odd the kids live with their dad. 
will they go to my parents house to verify they live there? do they do that? currently he’s going through the process of getting hired with ups but he’s heard it can take forever to get hired …"

"[il] work exemption due to mental health - what does my therapist need to write? | for people in [illinois], top box is a great way to get fresh produce for an affordable price! | possibly dumb question but does the 30-day period include the day of application submission? recently my mental health has become so severe that i can't even function doing simple daily tasks, let alone continue to look for work or work in any capacity. i'm scared this will mean losing my food stamps since i have no idea how long this will last (it's already been a couple of months and getting worse). my therapist said she is more than willing to write  something i can submit stating due to my mental health, i'm unfit to work or continue to work, but she's not sure exactly what she should say because she's never written a letter like this. i believe they're not allowed to ask for details about the specific mental health issues i'm dealing with, but beyond that neither of us can find information on what they need her to say in order to get it approved.   


does anyone have experience with this? any help would be appreciated. 

i just discovered them a few weeks ago. i'm housebound so getting to a farmer's market to take advantage of dollar for dollar snap matching isn't an option for me, and produce from the store is too expensive for me since ordering online means paying more as it is.

top box does deliveries only every 2 weeks, but the delivery is free and for produce boxes, using snap will get you 50% off, up to $15 off in total. their large mixed produce boxes come out to $9 once you get your snap discount, or a small personal produce box comes out to $5. being they only deliver every other week, this means not being able to eat produce daily of course, but right now my aim is to do better than none.

anyway, i wasn't sure how well known they are and thought i'd share it here!

"fraud/stolen ebt $$ last november i was shopping for a few grocery items (about 15$ worth). has a ebt balance of over 1k. card didn't go through so when i got home i called ebt. they told me there was activity of someone using my account in another city. they used up pretty much my whole balance except for maybe 4$. the worker supposedly made a case and told me i would get that balance back in a few (3-4) weeks. i have every transaction with case# written down. 
it's been 5 months now and nothing. is this an actual scam from ebt, because i had a pretty high balance?
i'm in san diego california and the theft happened in los angeles (in which i haven't been to in years)."

(quarantined because of covid positive and don't want to spread the virus. the majority that is over but any local charity food service i know of you have to literally go and line up for food. i don't want to risk it.) i don't know what to do and starting to have a panic attack. i feel like i'm going to die.

edit:  
because the automod said to include it. this is in michigan btw.

ok so i'm supposed receive a small amount then a pandemic amount all in food stamps. the small amount loaded up but the second pandemic amount didn't yet. (but it never had a set date and i've always been worried about them taking that amount away eventually. maybe it's time but i'm better prepared compared to the last time they tried taking it away.) however a very small cash amount loaded onto my card instead of a pandemic amount. i never signed up for cash assistance. online information doesn't report anything about it. what is that for?

update:i posted earlier here about food stamps not refilling (found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/s8ear3/my_food_stamps_didnt_refill_this_and_no_pending/htgf1rb/?context=3)) and i finally sort of found out what happened.

i was unable to get through to anyone about my stamps by calling. (always busy etc. run around between card and number and no email provided to contact for help.) so i sent a digital application for food stamps (never did this before but it was something made possible through their new mibridges site.) with a message at the end (they allow comments at the end) with my current situation and asking them to email me.

i got an email back about an hour later (wow that was pretty fast.) basically saying i was denied because i share my stamps with others (i do not nor did i ever put that on my renewal application.), that my case worker tried to contact me by phone (i haven't received calls outside of family for the past few months but i do have issue with my phone not receiving some calls.), and that i should have received a denial letter. (i also did not receive this but i did receive a letter saying i was approved for renewal. i should have saved all this to a folder. i'm really dumb for not doing that but i can't even find the information for these letters through their digital site for the denial or approval so i don't really know what is up with that.)

so yeah not sure what exactly happened 100% (some kind of hiccup in the system?) but my food stamps are now being redetermined with the corrections just made with my case worker. (which luckily is now digital.)"

but i am still receiving my daycare assistance and haven’t had a copay. i am due to renew my daycare assistance march 2023, which is also when i’m due with my 3rd child. i am due to give birth on march 2nd 2023, and my last day of work until i get 6 weeks unpaid maternity leave is february 23rd 2023. they hold my job, but i get 0 pay. my question is, since i will be on unpaid maternity leave starting 02/23 and will be adding a 3rd child to my case, i should get approved for food stamps, but i’m concerned that since i will be on maternity leave they won’t approved my children for daycare assistance since i will be off of work for 6 weeks. this is a big fear because the daycare that my kids go to is always full, so if they cut me off and i can’t afford to send them myself (which i can’t), they will lose their spot. this is also where my 3rd child will be starting daycare when i go back to work at the 6 week mark & she has been on the waitlist since i found out i was pregnant. i have emailed the case worker twice with my questions, and have not received any answers to my fears.

one son working living with his girlfriend but still uses our mailing address. his salary is $48,300

other son works 30 hours a week. he can’t work more because of mental illness. we had a hearing for ssi but they didn’t give him continued benefits. his salary is $16,000.

son that works 30 hours a week is thinking about moving into a property we own in another state not too far from primary home. 

couple of questions. since we are struggling financially would son working 30 hours a week be eligible for food assistance? or food assistance for the household? 

my take home salary after deductions is $34,000 and sons take home is $13,000. however our monthly expenses are $60,000 including everything. so as you can see even with combined income we are short.

does anyone know the income limitations for food stamps? thanks!

hi in nj and filling out the application and have some questions. 

i live with my parents and buy my own food. my parents pay for household expenses. 

snap is asking for…

household members if i wish to add. should i add my parents?

is there anyone else in home who purchases and prepares meals separate from you? i guess i should answer yes? and add both my parents? 

housing expenses, do you or anyone in your household pay for housing expenses? this includes rent, mortgage, property tax, property insurance, etc. i don’t but my parents pay for housing expenses. same with utility expenses. 

housing type. don’t know if i should put get housing free of charge because my parents pay?

it asks for household utility expense. i don’t pay like above. should i ask my parents for utility bills and amounts?

thanks!

waited a few weeks...nothing

finally decided to call myself this week as im getting fairly desperate now ..... 

waited on the phone yesterday for 2 hours and finally got hung up on because office was closed

"connectebt.com appears to be temporarily blocking ips when using non-supported browsers i noticed today that if i try to use brave to log into connectebt.com, i end up blocked with an error code 14 - ""the request was blocked by the security rules.""  once i get this error, it comes up in any browser i use unless i change my ip with a vpn.  it goes away after time and does not seem to happen when i use only firefox. firefox won't work as long as a previous block is in effect, though.  between this and requiring password changes every 30 days, its like they want to be as obnoxious as possible to meet security requirements that cause more problems than they actually fix.  it's telling how ridiculous their requirements are when internet explorer is a supported browser when its dead and not likely to receive security updates.    
for the record, this is tn benefits."
"virginia- grad student hello i have been getting food stamps, ive only gotten like $100 monthly. they told me i was required to work 20hr a week because i was a student. now im in grad school, will that requirement still be in place?"
my snap came today. i’m in co and have a ssn ending in 4. i’m having a small freak out. should i wait until the 4th when my usual benefits drop or start spending right away? has this happened to anyone else?
"divorce, ssdi, and free/reduced lunch hello.

i haven't been able to apply for food stamps in az because i am still married to my ex. that should be resolved in a month.

i've also been waiting for ssdi for nearly 3 years and have a hearing in november. does that income count for snap or free and reduced school lunch and breakfast for my kids?

i know it will depend on what my total monthly ssdi amount will be, but if it is too high i don't know if i should even bother filing for state medical and food assistance if my ssdi income will put us over the limit (which would be a beneficial outcome from our current situation).

thanks!"
"why do my cases keep disappearing from benefitscal? | calfresh interview missed notice after doing an interview already this is the second time it's happened. the first was maintenance. is this the same deal?

this is my first time applying for calfresh in california (los angeles county). after applying (as a student) i took an interview via them calling me which took about 45 minutes. then i noticed on the benefitscal page that i had an interview scheduled, which i was never once told about. by the time i noticed it i had missed it and then it went away, so i thought i was good. this morning though i received a notice that i'd missed an interview. are there usually two for first-timers? or is there a miscommunication going on here."

"mi - case taking longer than 30 days, where do i file a complaint? | [michigan] my caseworker waited until past the 30th day of my case to contact me about more needed documents. | [michigan] fraud, do i report it or just leave it alone? | [michigan] caseworker sent employment verification forms, and spoke to my boss on the phone, what am i waiting for? i know i'm blowing this sub up with my questions but i feel like my caseworker really dropped the ball here and i'm becoming more and more angry and upset as time keeps going on. 

my case is taking longer than 30 days. my caseworker waited until literally the 30th day to read all of my messages i sent her asking if she needed anything to tell me i still need to submit more stuff. she said it's been 30 days so they need a fresh new batch of paystubs, unemployment, etc....

this is not ok!!!

i've been sitting here over the past month surviving on $30 a week and patiently waiting for my application to process. no calls, no voicemails, nothing. radio silence. then she waits until literally the 30th day to be like ""oh hey um...i need more stuff.""

i am not waiting another 30 days for her to sit around and tell me ""oh hey uhhhhhhh i needed uhhhhhhh"" like ffs its her job and why is she allowed to just sit on a case for over 30 freaking days?????

i'm fuming. i can't calm down. i swear to god what the point of offering programs like this and having timelines if they just blatantly ignore them? imagine if i didn't have my part time job, how exactly would i be eating right now????

where do i file a complaint? i've had enough. i'm tired of being fucked around as i drop weight from skipping days of meals just to feed everyone else in my household.

i. am. livid. 

i have been waiting over 30 days as of yesterday since i submitted every single thing my caseworker said i needed way back in early september/late october. she warned me she was new but i am so incredibly furious with her at the moment that it is taking a lot for me to not just report her. 

i have been surviving on only $30 a week for food for the past month. that's for me, my gf, and our cats. i have been throwing every single goddamned cent of unemployment at that rent balance i owed and every cent of my part time job has gone to other bills. 

when i noticed i was getting close to the 30 day mark i lost my patience and submitted a message to my caseworker via the online portal for my state. we can't leave messages for our caseworkers usually and there is zero way to directly connect with them on the phone. i currently have no phone service, i literally have nothing on because i can't pay for anything other than this massive rent balance to avoid eviction and the electric bill. i walked to a nearby store, connected to the wifi, wrote up a note on my phone like an email asking what else i was waiting for as my case had been silent since day 1 and i submitted every single thing she asked for way back towards the tail end of august/very beginning of september. i attached it as an uploadable document and sent it, hoping for an apology maybe? an explanation? anything?

she wrote me back today to tell me, she messed up, she needs more info from me ....i stopped reading after that. it has been over 30 days with no food in this damn house and me showering with laundry detergent from months ago. i am pissed. can i report her for negligence or something? this is just too much. i cannot wait yet again another 30 more days for her to sit on her butt and stare blankly at this other crap she's just barely asked for from me. my benefit reload date is 10/9 and it's still showing only $23. what can i do here because this is ridiculous? i feel like she just sat there and ignored my case until i finally spoke up. i'm not playing. who do i contact? i remember emailing someone when my tax refunds were delayed by an entire year at one point. do i take the same route?

edit: i fell asleep and woke up to a lot of helpful comments. i'll go ahead and report it and see if i can get a new card. i changed my pin immediately and used the ""freeze"" option on ebtedge, plus i blocked all ""internet"" transactions. i do use instacart for groceries so i think i know where my info was leaked. luckily as i said before nothing was stolen yet since they kept charging so much, like a ridiculous amount, so the charges kept getting rejected. 

(original post)
i haven't had any funds stolen because i get so little, but someone somewhere has tried charging my card several times for online orders in crazy amounts like $8,000 or $6,000. 

according to the ebtedge app, back in august someone repeatedly tried charging my card for $6,000 at a cottman foods in pa. then, yesterday someone repeatedly kept trying to charge my card for over $8,000 at a safeway in ca. both were attempted online through some sort of delivery service. 

since nothing ever came of it should i still report it or would i just be adding extra work to some poor employee who is probably already swamped?

i'll try to keep it as short as possible but i applied for ebt here in michigan after losing a job that paid well and having to take a job that pays less. my caseworker sent me employment verification forms for the job i lost and the job i gained. my previous employer filled it out on the spot and faxed a copy directly to my caseworker, easy peasy, no problem. 

the issue is my new job. i handed the forms for the new employer to my boss and he missed a few boxes as i hadn't been paid yet and didn't have a ""first paydate"" yet for him to fill in. i mailed it anyway, and received a call from my caseworker the next day that i missed as i was working. she apparently then just called my boss directly to get the info from him over the phone. i assumed that since she spoke to him directly she would have been able to verify everything with him right there. 

yet i just received the same exact blank employment verification form for the new job again today. do i have to ask my boss to fill it out all over again, or is there a possibility that my caseworker mailed it out before she called my boss. its ""mail date"" is the same day we all played phone tag. my case has been ongoing since august 28th, my benefits haven't changed yet, but i am making significantly less money than before and i am running out of food and am starting to panic a bit. i doubt it, but i figured i'd ask if i can possibly convince them to ""expedite"" my case as i literally have nothing to buy food with. it's getting serious. i was denied ser for rental help so all my income is going towards paying off the rent i owed and it's getting to where i'm only eating every other day. 

any ideas? any tips? am i just being impatient? does my boss have to refill the forms out? 

thanks!"

"will i qualify with money in owned cars and money in savings? {texas} my husband is going to step down from his job and take a pay cut that makes it so together we (family of 3) make between.

$1400 to $1700 a month

with that income a family of 3 should quality for food stamps in texas.

 i worry we won't qualify for a couple reasons and if anyone has advice for me i would majorly appreciate it. i'm new to food stamps.

reason one) 
 we have two vehicles we own
one we bought for $7500 and the other was $4500
we were given money from my husband's grandma and used our stimulus checks to purchase them.
before we had two old flooded from hurricane imelda cars that we traded out for the better ones.

reason two)
with my husband's job that he's about to step down from we've been able to save back $3500 and i'm scared having that much in savings and the cars would disqualify us and it would totally be understandable.

i figure if we get disqualified we could live partly off of our savings until it's gone then i can apply again.

also our son is autistic and i tried to get social security disability back in 2019 right before covid started and even with our old flooded out cars and nothing in savings we didn't qualify. i know i need to try again but it's kinda discouraging to continually get disqualified for help."

"california question on left over funds after being ""discontinued"" 9/17 i received our interview and everything went as planned. i received a letter a week later that my benefits would increase in october due to utility costs which is great. i also received a notice to send in a letter for proof of income which i did. i normally receive my benefit on the 10th of each month but i did not receive anything. i did get the 2 payments of $95 which i assume are back payments. i went into me calwin account and it now shows my ebt benefit is ""discontinued"". i never received any letter or notice. i am on my 90th minute of waiting on hold to find out what is up.

my question for you guys - i have $900 on my ebt card. will it be available for me to use into next month or will it evaporate tonight at the end of the month. it does show i was discontinued 9/30 so it did carry into october. but i dont know if i should run to the store and do some massive shopping or if it will be here tomorrow. any advice would be great! searched the internet high and low and nothing on discontinued funds and where they go. 

thank you! sacramento, california"
"couldn’t answer the call! hey yall. asking from texas here. i was called by the texas benefits the other day but could not take the call for the interview *note that i never had one scheduled. there was an option to press 2 if i could not interview at that time.

my first question is that is okay right? i didn’t mess up my chances to qualify? 

my second question is now i just wait for my status update in the mail correct? that’s what the automated phone call said if i wasn’t able to take the interview at the time. 

does an interview typically mean that your application is looking to be approved? 

thank you guys! 🤟🏽"
"question about my ohio snap benefits as far as i understood, the extra emergency allotment was supposed to end in february. i actually just got on them the 3rd week of january. anyway, i received a $95 benefit i think at the beginning of the month, but the hotline for my benefits says i am due $281 tomorrow. i am a single man, no kids…and i’m quite sure this is still the emergency amount. i’m absolutely not complaining because i’m hurting, but did i miss something? why would i still be getting this in march?"
"is benefitcal down? in ca, i’ve been trying to log into my benefitcal account and it show nothing, at first i wasn’t able to log in, once i tried today it shows that i have to start a new process. is this happening to anyone else?"
"emergency allotment for this month | last of the month for ea benefits | ea for los angeles? *california* 
did anybody still not receive theres? i am literally starving out here and when i called dpss to ask about it, they literally gave me the longest pause ever and just said “i don’t know, we don’t have any control over that”. they couldn’t give me one reason as to why i haven’t received it yet. there’s nothing pending and my account is active, it even shows my next deposit for december. i just want my benefits!!

does anyone on the east coast have their emergency $95? i’m in cali and i’m still holding onto hope that it’ll be here this month

i usually get mine on the same day that is listed on the county’s site but it’s the 29th and ive been eating one ramen a day until that ran out and i haven’t eaten in 3 days. im disabled and have $0 cash or ebt, and no ride to a food bank near me. i can’t believe they’re just letting people starve. actually, i can believe it 😂 

i called at 8am and was on hold for 52 minutes when the hold music suddenly stopped and the call just hung up on me. i called again and it ended with a worker screaming at me at the top of her lungs while i was crying and begging for her to help me. then she said i can’t help you and hung up on me. called me back 5 min later to say the “call was dropped” and i made sure to say no it wasn’t and that she was screaming at me and hung up. i’m so sorry for anybody who has to deal with these bad workers. i’ve had such great help but sometimes there’s a bad egg and it’s quite traumatizing"
"nyc: got expedited for one time but nothing after? | 61 yo, no earned income, dependent = eligible for snap? update:
yay! snap benefit was deposited to the card! thank you everyone for your input!! 

*tldr?: received one-time expedited snap in 2023 along with approval letter for on-going benefit in nyc until 2026. didn't get any benefit after the one-time benefit. called 718-557-1399 (3 hrs on hold) and they said case needed a request to be ""activated."" the rep on the call requested that during the call. after a few days, case became for ""active"". less than 2 weeks passed since then and just received the snap benefit! (and yes, checked at the grocery and it went through) =d*

orignal post:
so very confused here..

questions: 
1. does anyone know if there another interview or additional steps that's needed to receive the ""ongoing"" benefits after one-time ""expedited"" snap benefit was received (even though the letter saying it's been approved is in my hands)?? 
2. are there normly two separate case numbers for ""expedited"" and ""ongoing"", or are they lumped into one case#? or do i have to apply *again* for a new case for ""ongoing"" benefits? 
3. is it normal to wait 2 hours+ on a call to talk to someone at nyc nutrition assistance program?

background:
snap application was expedited and recieved the benefit on 6/3/23. also *got mail about monthly snap being approved and that it will be provided on 4th of every month.*
but didn't receive anything on 7/4 so checked accesshra, and saw that it asked to submit a document that was already submitted... so resubmitted same document on 7/5. 

called human resources administration today (7/17) to hear of the current status for the ongoing benefits, and the automated message said expedited benefits were given as one-time payment and the ""decision hasn't been made for application for the ongoing snap benefit"". then gave direction to directed to call another number for details (nyc nutrition assistance program). nyc nap(?)'s automated message said the case was only for ""one-time benefit"", so been on hold to talk to a human for past 2 hrs (keeps saying ""your hold time is more than 45 mins"").  

phone numbers that's been tried:
human resource administration 718-762-7669
nyc nutrition assistance program 718-557-1399
fyi - checked access hra too, only says one time snap on the case and doesn't say anything about ongoing benefit

please help! thank you in advance!!

i'm posting for a friend who is not tech savvy but is trying to check if she qualifies for snap. 

she's turning 61 years old this year and lives with her child in queens, ny. she is retired (no earned income) and gets $100 monthly cash allowance from the same child. the child reports her as a dependent when filing for taxes (household of 2, annual gross income around $65,000). 

can she receive snap benefits?"
"do i have to report my college scholarship refund as income when applying for snap benefits? hello, i am a 21 y/o full time college student working 15 hours part time every week. i live with my partner (none of our expenses are shared) and i am trying to apply for snap in nevada. this is my second time applying for snap. i was denied because my income at the time was too high (i was working full-time then). 

my main concern this time is the refund i received from my college scholarships. these scholarships are not federal grants, but were awarded to me strictly on merit. i worked very hard to gain these scholarships and they are the reason why i can even afford to go to school. i go to community college, and this semester i was awarded a fairly high amount due to me taking a gap sem to work full time (award rolled over to this sem). after my tuition and fees were covered, i was left with about a $3000 refund.

i am thankful for this money, but most of it will be going towards rent, living expenses and transportation as i navigate this semester. my income as a part time worker is barely enough for me to survive. additionally, i know that i will barely have a refund next semester, so i am trying to salvage as much of the $3000 as i can so i can continue to go to school full-time. 

anyway, i mention all this because i know that we have to report our income/how much we currently have in our bank accounts. i have my regular checking account, which has about $400-500 in it right now. however, i have another bank account. this account's *sole* purpose is to house my scholarship money so i don't go spending it willy-nilly (out of sight, out of mind). that account has about $2500 in it right now. 

my questions are:

1. do i have to report my $3000 scholarship refund as income when i apply for snap benefits?
2. do i have to report the other account that holds my scholarship money when they ask me about my bank accounts?
3. if i have to do either or both of these things, will this disqualify me from receiving snap benefits?

i'm really stuck right now. any help would be appreciated. thank you so much :)"
"got job, got ebt cut, now jobless again | ca - renewal issues i started working about 3 weeks ago so i reported my new income and my ebt was cut to $16 a month. fast forward to today, i've been let go apparently so i have no income. even though i was just recertified can i let my worker know what just happened so i can try and get my regular amount again? i am in california.

"help applying for snap in illinois | does anyone else have an issue using their card at target? il i recently moved to illinois at the beginning of this year. i had previously gotten snap from ma for almost 2 yrs and when i moved i closed my case because i was told i could continue getting it in illinois i just had to apply. i'm a bit confused with the application process here, i currently live with my bf. we share utilities, i pay for all groceries and cook all meals and he pays for rent. i am currently unemployed (but am actively looking) and he has a job but he is self-employed. my savings are dwindling from spending so much on groceries, so this would really benefit me. i am adding him as part of my household but i am afraid i may not get approved since he pays our rent but he never pays for the groceries.   
i was wondering if anyone has ever been in this situation or had experience with this. i'd love advice or input pls.

hello, does anyone else have an issue using their card at target?
i currently live in illinois.

i use to live in ma and if i had let’s say $40 on my card but my total was $60 it would take that $40 off and then the rest i’d pay with debit. well everytime i’ve been to target it refuses to take the amount off my card that i have left and i am forced to pay with my debit card the full amount for my groceries. i’ve only bought twice at target due to not being able to get to the normal grocery store etc. i’ve even tried to tell the cashier if she can do the amount on one card and the rest on another and they always are rude about it and i give up.

i’m wondering if anyone else has this issue and what i can do to fix it because i really can’t keep using my money for bills and rent on groceries when it doesn’t work!"

anyone know what happens next? and what i should do if anything ?

"work requirement for one parent while the other works. | snap work rules and mandatory eandt? we have 4 kids, ages 6, 8, 10, and 16. i work full time, and my wife is the stay at home parent. we get food stamps for everyone, kids and both parents. location: ny. 

recently, we got a letter saying my wife has to look for work soon to continue food stamps. we are completely unable to both work. with 4 kids, you have to have 1 parent at home. the 16 year old goes in and out to her biological mothers. so, she is completely unreliable for babysitting. each kid gets out at different times for school, and the youngest gets out first. christmas vacations, summers, etc. we can't leave the kids home alone.

a babysitter would nullify the income of one parent working. also, ever since our 16 year old fell found the stairs at a daycare, we said we would never again use a daycare or babysitter ever again. plus, i had to fight dss for daycare pay costs. the whole babysitter/daycare was a nightmare 16 years ago, and it left us with the intention that we would never ever do that again. 

can my wife just opt out of food stamps to not go look for work while myself and the kids are on food stamps to bypass the requirement of looking for work? i'm not sure if the requirement is because my wife is on my case or because she is in the household at all and not working. it's my food stamp case with my wife and kids on mine. so could i just remove her from it?

ps. anyone who thinks a stay at home parent isn't working is bs. her day is filled with cleaning, laundry, cooking, homework, etc. it just doesn't make any money.

edit: upstate ny for location.

location ny

i work full time. my wife takes care of the kids, picking them up from school, dropping them off, etc. we have 4 kids ages 6, 7, 9, and 15. my wife does not work. myself, my wife, and our kids are under my food stamp account. except the oldest.

she is listed in general snap work rules but her name is.not listed under e and t assignment.

we just got a notice from snap saying that she has to accept any job offered to her. 

we called their office and they said that after covid they are starting to make people look for work. 

a couple questions about all this....

1. i thought you only has to look for work if you were receiving temporary assistance or cash assistance? 

2. the federal government website says if you have any dependants under 18 you do not have to look for work. how is ny making her look for work when we have 4 kids under 18?  the paper we got from ny dss says 6, but the federal government says 18? how can ny override the federal government rules?

3. how can she possibly work with her taking care of 4 kids? each kid goes to a.different school, getting out at different times, etc. this would require a babysitter, which would nullify her income from working at all. it would be better in this case to drop my wife from my food stamp account so she.doesnt have to work. taking care of the household of 6 people is a job, it just.doesnt pay anything."
"chances of being approved this time? tried to apply twice last year and got denied i guess due to me still having had some savings. but i'm at the point where my savings are extremely low and to where i can only pay bills and rent (after it being raised about 20p bucks since last year) for the most part. my mother has been helping me with food, but that's once a month when i visit her hours away. right now i'm working 2 jobs that gets me about a little over 2k a month depending on my hours. they've asked me to send in the income and rent and such. but would i potentially have a chance to get anything if the combined income is somewhat over 2k despite 90 percent of that going to rent and bills? i'm in nc if that matters. sorry."
"i keep getting snap payments despite ui benefits reported (nyc) edit this is for ny state

so we were finally able to receive our snap benefits card but when we applied this was when we initially lost out job. have been using our snap benefits but i uploaded all of the documentation showing the unemployment benefits plus the $600 weekly which began back in april, but we continue to get our monthly payments and i am unable to get in contact with anyone over the phone. 

should i be concerned with having to pay this back at some point? am i still entitled to these monthly payments despite not working and collecting unemployment? uncertain of what to do."
"from a tx worker... we apologize for the extremely long wait in your cases. we understand and that's why we are working long hours and saturdays to cover this. this isn't a sermon, its a plea for our applicants to help us.

our goal is to finish your application the first time we see it, but its difficult when there are so many blanks in the application and there are no verifications provided with the applications/renewals. we are spending too many days trying to plug in missing information that should already be with the application, and this was never an issue before. those are weeks we could have used to process thousands of new applications.

*always* provide verification of your id, address, income, rent/mortgage, child care, and past due bills with your application. employers and landlords rarely disclose information to us.

provide 2 representative check stubs from the last 45 days that include your name, your employer's name, gross income, hours, and pay date. *please no screenshots of your direct deposit or your payroll app that doesn't show names.*

if you are self employed, keep your earnings tracked on a calendar. you can submit the previous 2 complete months or the last 4 pay dates if you are paid weekly, biweekly, or semi-monthly if you have a fixed schedule. if your boss pays you in cash or personal check with no deductions, have them write it. and always date and sign this.

you get help for rent, utilities, child support, toiletries, etc.? get verification of how they help you, 1 amount of how much they give you or pay for you, and how often they help you. have them sign, date, and put a phone number. if you are past due, provide your bills.

it is rare when we deviate from this list of requirements.  sometimes all we need is proof of your address, and it gets to us when that's all we need and we won't come back because we have to continue with the other applicants. 

*we don't know when max allotments get deposited, but if you are approved in a month it gets deposited, you will be eligible and it can take up to 60 days.*"

"don't use walmart website or app to place an order. so i got my snap benefits of $280 the 6th after struggling for weeks to be able to afford food and the morning they came in i placed an order on the walmart app to have it delivered at my apartment like i usually do because i don't own a car. the order came (which was about $40) and on 8th i tried to make another purchase but it got declined. after checking my older purchases online i saw that after immediately after i placed my walmart order, a charge for $220 was posted on my account from a walmart in florida. i live in arizona by the way so it obviously wasn't me, someone must have hacked the walmart website and stole my card information and used up nearly all my benefits. i have to call my local des office to see what can be done about this and i hope i can get reimbursed somehow but i have have heard similar stories and they are just out of luck and don't get their benefits back. i'm very upset that walmart would allow this crap to happen and i can't buy food and it pains me to think i might have to wait until next month to get my next benefits."

"food stamps delayed in el paso county, co someone suggested i post this here.

location: el paso county, colorado, usa

quick  backstory: we have been on food stamps for a few years.  the army got  my (now) ex husband hooked on oxy and he had a total mental breakdown  and left our family basically homeless.  we went on assistance.

how  it works here:  you apply for benefits.  you have to prove you're a  citizen.  you give them a ton of documents.  you have to work to receive  food stamps.  about every 6 months, you have to ""recertify,"" i.e., you  have to prove your situation is the same and you still need food stamps.   i have had issues in the past when i didn't recertify on time, but  they always fixed it in a reasonable amount of time.  i don't like their  system but it was always my fault in the past when i didn't get them on  time.

when i recertified, i  noticed the website was somewhat different.  what was troubling was that  some of my information was wrong, most notably that my daughter was now  listed as a non-us citizen.  they have all her documents, they know she  is a citizen.

they also made me prove my son is still in high school.  they didn't do that with my daughters.

i  also noticed that changes i made months ago were ""under review""  (actually they are still under review), meaning no one has so much as  opened my file since last summer.

i  didn't get my fs by the beginning of december.  i went on a local fb  group and asked if anyone knew what was going on, they said the news did  a segment on the situation.  they said the office is ""short staffed.""   but several people said that they also recertified and still ... no  benefits.  people suggested i call or go to the office.  i called them.   i had been on hold for 2+ hours when i had to go to class.  i called  them 2 times, same result.  finally i called them and waited three hours  (i was told i would have to wait that long), someone finally - after  three hours on hold!! - answered the phone.  i talked to them for 5  minutes.  they said they would put in a ticket.  that was about 3 weeks  ago.

last week, they texted me  that i would have my recertification interview (yes, they do phone  interviews) to determine whether we are eligible.  normally, it is a 10  minute conversation. this interview lasted 35 minutes and they asked me  so. many. questions.  normally, they will give me the fs stamps within  24 hours of the interview.  i still do not have my fs, several days  later.

oh ... lol ... and lucky i  received the text because the letter they always send to inform you of  the interview was put in my mailbox an hour after the time of the  interview.  it took 5 days to send that letter about 10 miles across  town."
"california p-ebt for childrens lunches update? does anybody know whats going on with the california p-ebt for childrens school meals?

im not on snap benefits, cal fresh or unemployment, but we got the pebt card for my daughter for last year (march-june, aug & sept). the state sent it to us automatically and the extra money really did help out with putting food on the table as we are lower income.

according to the internet, it looks like pebt has been approved for the 2020-21 school year, and it looks like ca is working on it, but there have been no updates.

does anybody know whats going on with this?

it looks like the cards were supposed to go out this month and be pro-rated from last year, but i havent seen any updates at all.

anybody have any info or updates?

"please help, never received ebt card in florida i was approved for ebt benefits in florida on 1/25. i never received my card even though i got the letter in the mail stating i was approved for benefits. after waiting for a few weeks, i went online on my account and requested a replacement card which never came. i have since done this 3 times, today being the 4th time that i have requested the card. there is no way to track the mailing or arrange for me to pick it up at the post office. i have called every customer service number for florida access i can find, only to be stuck talking to a robot on an endless loop. when i ask for a live representative, the line says ok and then instantly hangs up. i have been trying to call them for weeks now to no avail. it is so frustrating and mentally exhausting. there is no customer service email i can find either. i am unemployed, struggling to look for work at the moment, and i am in desperate need of this ebt card. i really don't know what to do anymore. i feel extremely depressed. this system is absolutely horrible. please give me any advice. i am losing hope."

"confused about household rules california, san diego county. 

i live with my ex spouse (we are both women), who is disabled on ssi, we separated and divorced in 2018. we have two kids. she lives in our home, in her own room, does not buy or prepare food with anyone (she actually has a provider who comes help her with that), and our finances are separate. 

she only gets $1000 a month from ssi with her rent of $650, utilities added, car insurance, gas, etc. it leaves her with about $10 a week for food. she has to wait for the once a month when some neighbors bring some expired leftover food from stores that only last her about 3 days because the portions are very limited. this isn’t enough for her! she can’t do anything with the kids because she has no money. 

i am not responsible for her financially or in any way. i do not want to have to buy her food when i can barely afford my own for me and the kids!

but while she qualifies for calfresh on her own, they are refusing to separate the household despite the above facts. can someone explain the logic to me? if anything, i believe she needs them more having kids in the home she can’t financially support during her visitation time. what is she supposed to do? there is nowhere else for her to move with her income so low, but she shouldn’t be starving because of this rule, nor should i be forced to buy her food (i’m actually not allowed to) when my budget is already so tight for having to pay for everything for the kids and paying more rent too. we are not a couple, we are not together, we live separate lives and she follows her visitations times with the kids."

 i was able to explain that in my app and was able to give my ssn and id. i just got some mail from my county one of the three papers i got says ""phone appointment letter."" it says that i'll have a phone interview but the problem is that it says it'll be on 12/28/2021 which is almost 3 months away. it's just way too long to not have any assistance. the other two letters are for sar 7 eligiblity. i'm not exactly clear on what that is either. am i misunderstanding the letter? the application said i'd have 10 days to get a phone call from my county. am i actually supposed to wait this long? was i approved and is my card on the way? it's a little scary to be honest if i actually have to wait that long. any help or advice is appreciated.

"texas snaps | texas snaps, do they check college admission? has anyone else been waiting long time for approvals? i have been trying to add my partner to my acct and it's been 2.5 months now and he still has not been added since we filed. i called again about a week ago to see how things were and they said that it's been busy for them. they also said they changed my request to ""priority"" but it has still been a week since.

hello everyone, i told snaps i was going to college this semester but got really ill and could not attend. will they check to see if i went or should i go ahead and tell them? im just worried they will take my benefits away. im just now going to the doctor and dont know how to go about all of this. thanks!

maximum shelter cost-disabled-az hi all. received notice of my ebt changing in feb(like many of us) and decided i should really look carefully at their calculations. noticed the maximum shelter cost on my fact sheet listed as $624. my actual costs are 800(rent which includes utilities). i am legally disabled so it was my understanding there was no cap on my shelter cost so i should have the 800 deducted from their calculation not the 624. is there something :i am missing?
"how to report non job income hi, this is my first time renewing and i don’t know how to write in income that isn’t from my job. some of it is allowance from family, and there is also money coming in from mercari where i sell things and i also got a credit card refund. on the form (texas) under “money coming into your home” there is “person, company, or agency paying you the money. if you are working for yourself write self”, “hours worked per week”, and “how often paid?” and i wanted to know how to fill those in. allowance is biweekly, but the money from mercari is non linear and the credit card refund is a one time thing. or is the form for just in general instead of specifically that month? thank you in advance!

also, the credit card refund was 1000, i overpaid, and was wondering if your monthly income was solely dependent on your single bank statement? this will likely never happen again, what do i say to let them know that? thank you!"
"snap benefits payback demand i was without work for three years while i worked on and waited for my ssdi process to take place, as i could not return to work because of a host of physical issues. i was easily able to qualify for snap benefits in az because, in spite of my wife working, our outgo was actually larger than our income. i was finally awarded my ssdi early retirement last october which included a year of eligible back pay ( which disappeared almost immediately due to unpaid bills). my snap benefits were canceled upon my receiving my disability income, which was to be expected. yesterday i received a notice that all my snap moneys i received would have to be paid back. there was no explanation, just a listing of what i was paid over the year and a half that i received the benefits. can they retroactively request the return of the money because of the ssdi backpay i received? what if i had won a lottery a year later? would i have to return the money even though i was truly eligible at the time? seems really fishy to me. any insight would be appreciated. i will also be calling them for an explanation. i still am not in a position to pay them any lump sum if i have to, but a small monthly amount could work."
"why only $23? hey guys, im trying to figure out why they only gave me $23 to spend monthly when my coworker was getting $500 who was married but getting a divorce. we had similar expenses which is why we were trying to compare the two situations. im a mom to one child and im the only source of income. i work a retail job and did bring up commission but it’s super low. what can i do? my hours did also decrease which is something that i’d be able to mention. i also am in the san diego/riverside area. im a mom trying to fix this to put food on the table. any advice is appreciated, thank you!"

"ebt cash why would i have 21 dollars on my ebt cash balance? i don't qualify for ebt cash. neither does my wife. we had the extra ebt benefits from the pandemic go on our card overnight. here in nm, everyone is getting the maximum amount for the number in their household. but, this time, there was 21 bucks put on the cash slot also. that's never happened before and i don't believe should've happened. i don't want to take it if it's a mistake. any ideas why this happened??"

am i calling to have an interview or set up one? and what would be the best phone number to do that? i'm guessing it's the generic phone number to just contact them?

"scheduled phone interview for food stamps but my case worker never called i applied for food stamps in georgia on monday received a letter and call on thursday saying i had a interview on friday (today) at 11:30. well low and behold no phone call. anxiously waiting, i called my case worker's direct line around 1:00. no answer but i left a message. does this typically mean a person has been denied? my application online says registration complete. i've been denied previously reason being i made too much money (it has to be just pennies over). since then my rent has went up $350. not to mention the cost of groceries keep going up."

i applied for benefits and got an interview within the first 3 days because i might qualify for expedited services for calfresh and i already received a document that i don’t need immediate cash aid. fine. but they keep rescheduling my interview and when i call accis they transfer me to workers who say they can’t help cause it’s a new case. i have no income, my child support is paused but i still reported what i usually get. i uploaded everything i’m sure they’d ask for and i’m wondering if at this point i should go in person to an office? or idk i’m frustrated i really need the grocery money. i’m in ca by the way!"
"struck down work requirements? (texas)

according to this the biden administration struck down work requirements for snap:

https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/food-stamps-biden-trump/index.html

this is a practical question i can't find anywhere so please hear me out. when do the work requirements for people to obtain food stamps end? i am disabled so the 20 hour work ""requirements"" have been a barrier and has been hell in trying to obtain food stamps again as they try to kick you off rather quickly. i submitted my doctors work exemption form but they still try it every five seconds.

so when does it go into effect that the work requirements thing ends? thanks."
"fraud someone i know and been around is defrauding multiple government agencies (food stamp, housing, social security, etc;) as well as credit card fraud and smuggling drugs into the country. is there a centralize agency to report all this to? or do i have to submit it one by one. i have some proof and would like to submit it when reporting. though a part of me wants to stay confidential the other part of me is scared silly out my pants and want to remain anonymous. my worries is if the agencies look into my complaint and make a case out of it remaining confidential my info may eventually be released and i don’t want this criminal to know who reported him."

"snap benefits to increase in october – what will an increase mean for you? hi, my name is john puterbaugh and i’m a journalist with nextadvisor, the personal finance section of time (https://time.com/nextadvisor/). i’m working on a story about the snap benefits increase that is set to take effect next month (https://time.com/6090755/food-stamp-increase-biden/). the increase is expected to be about $36 per person per month on average.

i am hoping to learn from current snap recipients how much of an impact an increase like this would make for your monthly grocery budget. along with that perspective, the main goal of the story is to spread awareness of the increase, and share information on how people can locate and sign up for assistance in their own communities (with snap and other programs).

if anyone is willing to share their thoughts with me, please reach out to me here or directly via email: john@nextadvisor.com."
"does an 18yo in a household have to be working? | nc-- benefit status changed-- expired?? | nc: renewed two weeks via fax like last time but haven't heard anything about interview | new deposits north carolina? | will food stamps catch up with inflation? | random food item i've always bought declined? | anyone else get a sudden unexplained increase in additional benefits? | haven't heard from caseworker about renewal, benefits come tomorrow, what to expect? | case worker argued about retail bonus pay household of 6 (4 children, two adults including myself), and i'm currently pregnant (very early still). my eldest will be 18 in september. 

he is supposed to go into the air force but seems like he is giving up on life and might not pursue that. if he stayed in our household is he required to have a job for us to continue to receive food stamps? i see where an exemption says if there are dependents under 18 in the household. 

i'm just confused. or does he no longer count as my household and would have to have separate food stamps?. edit-- i now see he is my household until he is 22. 

so then the question is does he have to be working when there are children in the house (youngest 2 and if baby is born without issue, then a newborn in household).

i just got this in the app and after my grocery purchase with an amount. even though the amount is in green that much money disappeared in addition to what i spent right after the purchase. i can't find anything about north carolina and expiration dates and i have been using my card constantly.

are they behind? it said an interview is required but i don't think i got a formal one last time. i think they just called and asked me about something. but other times i have gotten a notice. i tried to get this all done in person but there was no parking even in the overflow parking lot.

i'm seeing 6 $35.69 pending additions. is this p-ebt for spring break or something? though we only have 3 children of school age and are a family of 6. i am very excited for this deposit because we need help due to inflation prices. but i am scared it's a mistake.

we are losing covid full benefits in august in my state (nc) i'm assuming so then the question is will food stamps ever catch up with inflation?

just bought some groceries and one item was declined. i have never had this happen before. state is nc if it matters. no list of banned items and is not alcohol, vitamins etc just usual drink. can version worked.

i'm in nc and it looks like p-ebt because it reflects the number of kids i have, but it's significantly more. i'm worried it's a mistake. has anyone else received anything like this? their pebt was just $30 each kid these past couple months, though i did get similar amounts last year though so nothing is really consistent.

this is in nc if it matters.
she asked for all the info for my husband's bonus' from his job (and other questions that was basically just reading down the application so not sure if that was the interview or not). never heard back if everything we submitted was okay. no incoming mail either still according to usps. so tomorrow when it would reload at 6 am what could happen? there be nothing? there be the old amount? there be a new amount? i'm sorry if this is a dumb question, i am very nervous.

anyone have trouble explaining things like bonus pay to a caseworker? i was shocked when my case worker argued with me that my husband is not paid bi-weekly but weekly because he got a bonus check for the month. the bonus check has 0 hours listed and she said well it doesn't say bonus on it. i explained it's a quarterly bonus and last got it november but it varies greatly because it's based on company profits. she has to call the retail store now to verify and ask all the same questions. i'm worried the math is going to be off now, or she's not going to understand still. i'm confused because how could my husband be the only retail worker she has dealt with? i had to do this with medicaid too and they never had problems. she didn't offer to see the bonus from november (and i offered even july's also). i'm so stressed."

any advice would help.

had an appointment today at 9am, waited around the phone for an hour, no call. tried to call my case worker, went to voicemail, so i left a message, and i also sent her an email. 

after another hour she finally responded back to my email stating that she did call me at 8:57, but the call didn’t go through because the number i provided “isn’t a working number”. 

i had my mom call me, my friends from a few counties over, all of their calls went through, so it’s not my phone service dropping calls. 

could she have just lied to me? i don’t know of any other explanation other than she just forgot to call me and then lied about my phone number not working. i know for a fact my phone service is paid for, and her office is in the same town i’m living in, so we’re not far away at all. 

she got back with me again and said she could try again after 1, but at this point i’m not too trusting of her word and don’t know what to do if she doesn’t call again? very upsetting start to my morning and day off."

"lost benefits to skimming hi, i know this is a subreddit for food stamps but i could not find any for calworks or specifically cash aid benefits so i hope this is allowed and i’m able to receive and help or clarification to my situation. also i am in the state of california.

on may 3, i checked around midnight to make sure i received my benefits and they were there. later that day around 2 pm i went to the atm to withdraw the funds from my ebt card and then deposit into my bank account so i could pay my rent. the atm said insufficient funds which i thought was strange so i entered another lower amount and it said the same thing. i checked on the provider app and to my surprise it said $840 withdrawn from a us bank in apple valley six hours ago. 

i am about an hour away from apple valley and have no car. then i realized my card is in my hand how the heck is this possible. from there i called the 877 number on the back and they issued another card and said to call and report the incident to the welfare office. in person i submitted the proper paperwork and three other people were there for the same thing. the guy helping me told me on may 2nd there were fifteen people who had the same problem. i also filed a police report although i was told i did not need to anymore.

they said it takes 21 days, i’m assuming and hoping that means 21 days to receive my funds again. however, my rent is due and i just do not know what to do. has this happened to anyone else and how long did it take to receive funds? i did search this up before posting and found a lot of people have had their benefits stolen in this way. i am just unsure about the timeline or process for cash benefits.

i’m afraid my landlord will evict me, i received a three day notice on the 5th. it is well passed three days, i don’t think he cares that this happened and i don’t have it.

thanks in advance and sorry this is all over the place, i haven’t been thinking straight since this happened.

edit: i know i won’t know for certain until i receive the funds back on my card. my reason for this post is to see if anyone else went through this so i could have some type of comfort. i truly apologize if it seems as though i just want a definitive answer for a timeline.

i am about an hour away from apple valley and have no car. then i realized my card is in my hand how the heck is this possible. from there i called the 877 number on the back and they issued another card and said to call and report the incident to the welfare office. in person i submitted the proper paperwork and three other people were there for the same thing. the guy helping me told me on may 2nd there were fifteen people who had the same problem. i also filed a police report although i was told i did not need to anymore.

they said it takes 21 days, i’m assuming and hoping that means 21 days to receive my funds again. however, my rent is due and i just do not know what to do. has this happened to anyone else and how long did it take to receive funds? i did search this up before posting and found a lot of people have had their benefits stolen in this way. i am just unsure about the timeline or process for cash benefits.

i’m afraid my landlord will evict me, i received a three day notice on the 5th. it is well passed three days, i don’t think he cares that this happened and i don’t have it.

thanks in advance and sorry this is all over the place, i haven’t been thinking straight since this happened.

edit: i know i won’t know for certain until i receive the funds back on my card. my reason for this post is to see if anyone else went through this so i could have some type of comfort. i truly apologize if it seems as though i just want a definitive answer for a timeline.

edit: june 10, 2023 my cash benefits were returned to my ebt. i am updating in case someone finds themselves in the same situation and wanted a timeline and resolution to this matter."
"food stamps ending in august even though my rent going up? i received a letter today stating my food stamps are ending due to increased income, however my rent is increasing in august as well. i have reported both my income (changes) and my rent increase in june.

would it be helpful to call a case worker and explain this before august?

"snap screwed up... | ??? | did you know? | ok, wtf is snap doing? | watch where you checkout! just a head's up because i just got a letter from hra here in nyc saying my ebt-snap case was going to be closed as of aug 30th and my benefits would be discontinued. apparently i failed to fill out the 18 month form and do it online or send it back to them in time via mail. thing is my benefits are cleared through 2025 according to the website and the app and i received no 18 month form.

i've been checking the hra site, reviewing what i might need to so regarding any forms for this or for medicaid recertification practically every week for several months just in case things changed now that the pandemic stuff is over. i've gotten nothing from them in terms of any kind of recertification paperwork and it always says i am good till 2025 snap wise. i go online and i can see a link for the form they want but i click it and it says i am not due yet for filling it out! so i can't oblige them if i wanted to.

i tried to call and of course got nobody. 2 hrs on hold and it's of course friday afternoon. my case center is actually out in brooklyn and quite a schlep for me as i am mobility disabled. i'm also direction blind when it comes to streets that are not numbered and i get lost easily in downtown brooklyn as i do not know it well. i really don't know if i am allowed to just go there without an appt because it's not listed as a walk in center apparently?

i'm so glad right now that a charity runs my building and i have caseworkers i can go to, that they have special people they can call at hra because otherwise i'd be losing my mind over this! the guy i need to talk to is gone for the day but they emailed him and he will look and figure it out they said on monday and get right back to me.

i have to believe that this is an hra f-up of some kind. my accounts say one thing. this form says completely another so either the info online and in the app is 100% wrong or they sent out this letter saying i was being cut off erroneously. either way someone there screwed up royally and i could have lost my snap over it. hopefully now i won't but now i don't trust hra, the app or the website at all and hra not answering the phone is just maddening when something like this happens.

i wish i could say this was the first time but no, this is the second time since 2018 that i've almost had my case closed and possibly had to call for a hearing just to keep them because some clerk closed my case without warning for no discernable valid reason that i can tell.

so please triple check your case online and in the app. keep on top of your regular mail because it looks to me that there are a lot of screw ups going on one way or the other at hra re snap. i'm glad i did not go for just online notices because i might never have gotten this letter at all. if the website and app are not correct then what? there was no notice in my inbox that i needed to do this form and nothing in my snail mail either. no way to know this until i got this letter...

just watch out because it could happen to you too!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

not sure of exactly what's going on but somebody just replaced the upcoming ebt funds that were cut as of friday. i'm still less the p-ebt $95 but i now have what the calculator says i'm supposed to have every month. the amount i supposedly still have on the card though is entirely wrong. i should have like $4 left. it says $208 but it's not actually there.  just a glitch i guess? so relieved though because at least it looks like i've still got my normal amount coming next week. losing the extra $95 is tough but i understand why that's gone. losing another $100 plus on top of that was just ow!

keep watching your totals if you are in nys because they're obviously adjusting things a lot....

that you can buy nutritional shakes like boost, ensure, slimfast etc with food stamps? 

i didn't. 

i'm diabetic and on a diet where i have to monitor my sugar and carbs pretty closely about 90% of the time. also, my digestive system gets messed up from ibd and sometimes i can't manage solid food well. 

i have ebt but i've been paying out of pocket to the tune of $40-60 a month for my shakes not realizing that i could have been using my ebt funds for them. 

just an fyi, because finding out that they qualify as food and that using ebt funds for them was ok was a welcome surprise for me.

i'm in nyc. i got my ebt benefits on the 1st instead of the 1st and the 13th this month. amount decreased slightly from what the two deposits usually were so i figured that was the whole amount for the month with the new increase minus the emergency benefits we'd been getting. 

i checked my card just now and there was another unexpected deposit of $250, almost the same amount i got on the first on top of the $50 i was trying to save for the rest of the month. 

so this month snap has paid me what i think is the new monthly benefit twice? 

i don't know if it's legal for me to spend these ebt benefits or not. did ebt or my state just decide to pay us twice a month now? are we getting emergency benefits or a bonus i'm not aware of? or is this a big goof on their part? is this maybe january's benefits paid early because of the holiday? 

i have no idea of what they are doing but i'm only one person and i never get anything like this amount paid to me in a single month. this is   quite a bit above what i was getting even with the extra $95 emergency benefit added on every month. i'm talking a couple hundred more...

anyone know what's going on? i sure as heck don't!

apparently some stores are finding skimmers at their self checkouts and that may be how ebt scammers are getting customer info. it makes sense that they would go for the self checkouts as they are not monitored as closely probably as traditional checkouts. also using your ebt card online to shop might not be as secure as you have to give the pin to checkout."
"my county in georgia is asking for verification of “food stamps work program exemption”… what does that mean? i’m self-employed. my eligibility for food stamps is contingent on “food stamps work program exemption”… what is that, exactly and what documentation are they looking for?

"help! calfresh ebt hacked and my county office won’t recognize my ss#? hi, i logged onto my calfresh benefits portal and noticed an unauthorized transaction that i did not make. i’ve had my ebt card on me at all times, so i’m guessing someone stole my information.
the issue is, i called santa barbara county office to report fraudulent charges, but the automated voice keeps telling me that the information i’m providing (case #, ss#, driver’s license #) does not match with their records. i have no way of reaching a person to speak to unless i physically visit the county office in santa barbara, but i am a college student and visiting home for the summer (i live decently far away from school).
i cancelled my card and requested a new one through benefitscal, but i’m worried that someone has my ss# and there’s possible identity theft. what should i do? and has anyone else experienced this?"
"is specific transaction info available? if someone used their food stamps to buy only or mostly junk food and other unhealthy foods, would an individual or a social services worker be able to see the detailed transaction history with each item bought if they wanted to? if someone could and did look into that would that get someone in trouble with the program for not making healthy choices?"
wondering when we will start getting benefits so me and my boyfriend applied for my food stamps on september 30th  it’s is now october 27th and just want to know if it will literally be last minute. we’re really on a tight budget i’m broke all i have in money for rent due on the first and my bf does uber eats right now as he’s still trying to collect his half for rent and money is running tight. food is so expensive is hard to eat a nutritious meal everyday i just feel helpless

"redetermination hasn't been processed il i received a notification notice on april 1 for redetermination on april 1. i submitted online on april 3, but as of today my redetermination hasn't been processed yet. i'm a bit worried because other years i have gotten answer way before now and the deadline to submit before i would lose my benefits is may 15. online it says my information is current as of april 1 so it appears that they haven't looked at my account since they sent the notification. my question is should i contact them to make sure my application went through or wait it out?"
work orientation i got a letter telling me i didn’t do the orientation. an that since i didn’t go it will terminate my ebt. i didn’t know about it or how to sign up. how do i fix this so i don’t get terminated and loose it?? is there some way to attend another one?
"what should i do if i know the the exact store that skimmed my ebt card? so i recently had $400 stolen of food stamps. because they skimmed my card. i only go to two stores to use this. i just found out that one of the store which is 7-eleven has a skimmer on the credit card reader. what do i do at this point?

keep in mind that the food stamps was stolen two days ago and i reported that two days ago. i have to wait 20-25 days for them to investigate.

what should i do now since i found out that there was a skimmer on the credit card reader? do i call the police and wait at the store or do i call ebt or?"
"bank question & inheritance it seems the total you can have is 2k in the bank?  does ebt check your bank balance?  i am assuming work income gets reported automatically since they did ask for paystubs again maybe a month or so ago.

recertification is in august.  i'm in ny.  i did call and leave a message about reporting an income increase last week, but of course no one ever calls back and the only way you talk to them is if you time it right & they happen to pick up. 

the inheritance 1st part distribution is 15k which i haven't deposited yet since i didn't want to without reaching them since i know you are supposed to report changes within 10 days.  i was unclear if it even mattered if it gets spent within the month.  it is all going to past debt and our house is over 100 years old and needs septic repairs which is expensive."
"colorado dhs, is very behind with processing snap for some... i called today to see if i qualified for the max allotment and was told my re certification from sept, still hasn’t been processed. the lady also gave me a number to call to escalate the issue as she stated “it’s been 2.5 months, supervisors should be aware that this is an issue, a broad issue”. i called the number to escalate the claim and left a vm. 

i was called back with in a couple of hours and the lady was very helpful, and assisted in processing the necessary changes. she had to finish and update a few things and said she would call me back again with an update. 

i missed her call and she left me a vm stating it’s all been updated and processed. 

i checked my snap account about 3 hrs later and have 3 months worth of snap loaded. 

thank gosh! 

so if you’re having issues call!! they are severely behind!"
"ebay reselling for a month hi guys, i am a new immigrant, i’m not working yet and i have been receiving snap benefits since july 2021, 
for the last month i started selling on ebay and made about $750 gross. i did not know i needed to report it (and still don’t know if i should) and was just reading around reddit and other websites saying that this is income and should be reported within 10days!

"got extra funds for may, unsure what to do. | got offered a job today, and i accepted! | what to do if you live with parents and pay them rent? az on the 27th there was a deposit of $199 made to my ebt card. i'm supposed to get $160 every 10th of the month. i'm not exactly sure what to do or who i should call about this. does anyone here have experience with this and what should i do? thank you.

i'm pretty sure my new income is going to be over the limit for snap in az. i haven't started yet, but when should i report my new job to des?

as the title says, i live with my boyfriend's parents and we pay them rent each month. they don't pay for any part of our bills or groceries. for over a year now i have been trying to get food stamps but each time they deny us because we don't have a ""landlord"" letter or a statement saying we pay rent. someone on the phone told me that it can be written on a piece of paper saying that we pay this amount in rent to so and so each month. everytime we do that a case worker denies it on the website. what can i do?"

reapplying? (tx) i applied for food stamps in nov last year and got denied bc of my boyfriends income. well now he is unemployed and we have a 1 year old so i applied again and its been 2 weeks and it still says pending? when will i hear something back?
"$20 benefit amount? so i was recently approved for calfresh and when i got my card, the approved amount was for only $20?

i called today and the lady i talked to said $20 was the minimum and that i was receiving such a low amount because i was on unemployment. the last payment for unemployment i received was 10/5.

and even if they were basing it off that, their website says the minimum right now is $250. am i just getting fucked?

$20 just kinda seems like a joke and a slap to that face. any info is appreciated!

"no paystub, is schedule ok? i recently applied for calfresh in san bernardino county and got all my info but they needed my info for a particular week since i didn't have a paystub for that time. i went back and checked all my stuff and realized why, i didn't work at all that week. i got my appointment call and they asked for that paystub before i realized i didn't receive it. now i had to submit my paystub but i didn't have it!  so what i did was send in photos of my schedule with text saying ""i did not work this week"". i have yet to hear about my application and every time i try to call the center to check my status i get an automated message saying that the maximum amount of people has been reached and i don't even get put on hold! it is so frustrating and i am just stuck in this limbo of whether or not i'll be getting anything"
"my oldest son works but doesn't pay any bills/ rent i recently applied for food stamps. my partner does low income labor, i'm on ssi. my oldest son recently got a job (not much over minimum wage), but we don't ask anything of him. he has everything set up to start college in the fall, and i'm happy with him just saving up

i had my phone interview, and they asked about people working in the house. i'm honest by nature, so my son came up. she said they'd count his income, even though he doesn't provide. i'm nervous now, because i'm afraid we won't qualify. out of pocket, we pay roughly $800 - $1000 a month in food costs, and it's killing us. we also have our 2 youngest boys, 13 & 10.

i don't want to lie, but i'm so worried about not qualifying. we're starting to get into debt with the inflation of food cost, and i just wanted a little help. i feel like a dug a hole, and i don't know what to do. did i completely screw myself over?

i was receiving snap for my two sons and i, their father was reporting the same address but was not staying in the house with us due to domestic issues so i didn’t report him as part of household because well he wasn’t here and wasn’t supportive financially.

fast forward to this january he lost his job and we agreed he could stay here again to help with the kids while i went to work full time again. i reported this on my case and added him to the household. 

 now an investigator is asking to have signed statements from everyone about where he was staying etc to prove my eligibility. 

what happens if i cannot get others to cooperate/sign the statement?? it is a complicated/toxic situation. will this turn into a fraud charge? will they just redetermine eligibility period and make me repay overpayments?"

"re-evaluation in dallas county, tx my sister is 60 years old and disabled due to a spinal fracture. she received the social security cost of living raise which caused her food stamps allowance to decrease to around $23 (i don’t remember the exact amount but it’s in the low 20’s) a month. 

in january of 2023, her mortgage went up around $30 a month due to property taxes and her hoa dues went up an additional $40 a month. these two increases wiped out the cost of living adjustment she received from the social security.

is there a way to get her re-evaluated to show her new monthly expenses to see if her food stamps can increase? if so, what are the steps to get that done. $23 is simply not enough for her to survive and she’s struggling. she’s located in dallas county, texas.

however, as i was trying to link my case to my account, i realized that i originally input the wrong zip code in my application so it listed me under riverside county instead of san bernardino county. i wanted to call the riverside office about this, but i cannot get past the automated part of the phone call as they cannot find my case with my phone number & social security number. i cannot get in contact with the riverside office at all. because i do not have a case under san bernardino county, i also cannot get in contact with their office.

benefits paid nyc recipient here. i applied in july on hra app. received messages for payments made on aug 31st. snap payment aug. snap payment for sep. went to get a temporary card and have still not been able to access the payments. i’ve been going to my center (jerome ave bronx) twice a week for the past 3 weeks. they do not let me speak. they will cut me off when i try to explain the situation. telling me my case is still pending. went downtown (union) and was told the my food stamps are on a different case. they need to be linked (cash & food). i use to have benefits in nyc over 7 years ago and think that may be the problem. but no one cares to help me or fix it. i’ve been looking for food pantries because it’s been almost 2 months and i have 3 kids. i don’t know what else to do or who to reach out to. this is a nightmare. does anyone have any advice for me? who can i speak to? i am a mother of 3 with one child with a severe disability. i am also a full time student.

i am asked by a sms to submit sar7.

there is a message from [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) about sar7 reporting. in this message, there is a pdf file to request filing sar7.

questions:

1. where do i submit sar7? print the pdf and mail it, file it online at [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com), or file it online at [getcalfresh.gov](https://getcalfresh.gov). or either way, or it is better off reporting it through xyz?
2. at [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com), one step of the reporting is to upload documents, but in the pdf and website, there is no information about what doc(s) i should upload. so i just leave it blank????
3. after submission (no matter online or in mail), how do i know if my report is received/processed?

"help! can’t get approved due to income verification but i’m prn at my new job. i’m having a hard time getting my foodstamps and childcare subsidy renewed.  it’s being held up due to income verification.    i’m in nursing school and i recently got a job as a nurse intern(basically fancy word for tech/cna).  i just got my first check july 30th.  which i did provide to them, including the formal job offer from my employer stating it’s biweekly pay, $16.50/hr, and it’s a prn position.  

prn is as needed.  i schedule myself for 12 hour shifts at the hospital.  this is suppose to be idea for nursing school students to work around our hectic schedules. i told them i intend to try to work 1 shift per week during school(starts august 20th).  this wasn’t good enough for them.

they want my employer to write on company letterhead a letter stating how much i will be working.  i asked the customer service rep how they can do that when it’s prn.  she says “ i don’t know, maybe how much other prn employees work.”  that’s not helpful.  prn is prn…i could work 48 hours a week or nothing. 

i haven’t asked my manager to write a letter yet because i don’t know what to ask her to write.  i already had a letter stating this is a prn position. i know employers hate filling this stuff out, i’ve had major trouble with past employers. what can i do?

"slight rent increase would it bump up ebt amount? | how much does paying rent increase ebt amount? in illinois.

i recently (2 months ago) started paying rent to my parents just $50 and and applied for ebt which receives $35 + the emergency funds that are about to end.

if i increase it to $100 and $50 for utilities what would be the rough estimate of food stamps i would receive? i want to make sure i'm able to afford the increase and still afford food+other bills.

thinking of paying $100/mo to my parents but might do 150-200 if ebt gets a reasonable increase due to it?


i make $300 a week working part time in illinois am not disabled but have limited working ability currently seeing a physical therapist who seems to think it'll be several months before i'm able to work full time.

recently signed up with ebt haven't even received the card but it looks to be $35 a month hoping to get that bumped up a little bit and essentially add whatever ebt is willing to give me into the monthly rent bill.

also do i need an official rental agreement or can i just give my parents cash/check (probably 3-6 months worth at a time) and we both report it on our taxes?"

"separated and ex drew ebt while i was out of the country hey y'all

i've tried to call my program integrity person in the county i'm in now, for weeks, and i've had no call backs and unfortunately never been able to get ahold of her. 

anyway, my soon to be ex husband apparently put my name on the application and drew ebt benefits january-march while he was unemployed and i was out of the country. when i returned to the us to live with my mom, i applied for food stamps to help me get back on my feet while i searched for a new job (i got a job about a week after i got home, and will have worked 30 days on may 15 and will likely apply again then). they called me when they got the application saying i'd used all my able bodied benefits the last 3 months and they let me know my ex husband had put me on his application. they tried to transfer me to program integrity and of course the call dropped. i've left 5-6 messages on her voicemail asking for a call back to discuss the situation but never received a call.

what should i do? should i call program integrity in his county or continue trying to call mine? any advice? he seems determined to make my life miserable...

"questions about not getting benefits due to dpss error every year i have to recertify for food stamps and gr at the department of social services here in los angeles california. sometimes they do it on the phone and sometimes they have me come in in person. i went to the dpss a few weeks ago to recertify and fill out paperwork. the worker helping me said the gr recertification went through smooth but for some reason she was having trouble recertifying me for food stamps. she was calling other employees over to look at her computer. she said they had a new system that was a little confusing and thanked me for my patience as i waited for her to figure it out. eventually she told me she thinks she figured out what the issue was and that everything would be fine. she told me i was all set and they wouldn't need anything from me until february 2024. a few weeks went by and then today when my benefits were supposed to show up on my card i see that only my gr (general relief/cash assistance) is on there but not the food stamps. this 100% has to be an issue on their end since i've been fully compliant (even going in person to sign papers and answer any questions they have). i live in supportive housing for chronically homeless people and people suffering from mental illness and i'm unemployed so there is absolutely nothing on my end causing my food stamps to be cut. if anyone is eligible i am. this is causing a huge inconvenience to me because i stretched out my food budget last month to the max and had just enough food to get through till today when i'm supposed to get my ebt food stamps. the problem is today is the 4th and it's a holiday (labor day). nobody is available for me to speak to in order to correct this mistake. so i basically have to starve for a day or try to go figure something out which screws me over on other prior obligations i had made for the day  i'm going through all this hell and being denied something i'm entitled to because of someone else's stupidity. 
my main questions for anyone that might know are...
1. has anyone been through something similar to this? do you think they'll be able to fix my benefits right away eventhough this is obviously a problem with their system that's been going on for weeks?
2. can i hold anyone responsible for putting me through this? the employee that interviewed me in person should have followed up until the recertification went fully through in her system and obviously she didn't. nobody followed up with me. i didn't get any indication there would be a problem receiving my benefits today like i normally do. the employee i spoke with told me everything was fine and i was good with them till february.
*additional info: i received a call from a lady at dpss a few days after i went in person. she begun to interview me and i said ""oh is this a follow up interview to the one i did a few days ago?"" and she said ""oh i didn't know you already spoke to someone else"" i informed her that i was just down there a few days ago to do an interview and recertification and she said that since i already spoke to someone else everything was fine and we didn't need to do another interview. she said she was calling to do the initial interview because she was unaware someone else already interviewed me but since they did everything was good and she didn't need anything from me after all. it seems very unorganized and like the people working there have no clue what there doing.
bonous question: why is everyone so terrible at their jobs nowadays? the skid row housing trust organization responsible for my housing just went broke and lost 15 buildings they were in charge of. there is a park where people openly sell crack and it's literally a block and a half from the police station on 6th street. the cops do nothing. i live in supportive housing and haven't had a working smoke detector in a year and a half despite complaining about it every other month. my mental health provider has no interest in addressing root causes of mental illness such as broken homes, bad parenting and rampant crime in people's faces, instead they just want to drug people and put everyone on psych meds. why is everything so horrible and how do we fix it?"

"snap closed/rejected after sar (pa) i signed up for snap at the beginning of the year. everything went fine and in no time i had benefits. fast forward a few months and the first time i had to complete a sar request, my benefits were instantly closed.

i'm the non-custodial parent and currently paying  child support. we live in seperate houses.

when i applied over the phone, my income was adjusted for the child support i pay the custodial parent. when i spoke with the case manager i was told that was a mistake and i don't qualify. something about i can't claim my child support if the children are part of the household. due to shared custody, the children are always considered a part. i did notice a mistake that for some reason it showed i still lived with the ex. even though it was corrected, it didn't make a difference. 

i don't understand this. if the custodial parents files for benefits, the income is automatically counted as income. why is it not a deduction for the payee? there is still children to support.

is there anything missing here that i can do? do i have any options?"
"louisiana resident - food stamps cut off due to verification for job i had 7 months ago. hello, i made a throwaway in order to ask about this. earlier this month i learned my food stamps were cut off, but i didn't know the reason why so i decided to try to re-apply for it. on tuesday i had my interview with my case worker, and she mentioned i got my food stamps cut off due to her receiving a report about a place called, ""cr cafe"". at first, i didn't know who that was as i haven't heard of this place before and despite the caseworker receiving a report about it, neither did she know who or what they were. i also told her that i have been receiving disability benefits for about several years now and gave her my ssn, but apparently when looking in her computer there was no information available on that? even though i've had food stamps for nearly 2 years and verified before that i was on disability. i was also pretty confused because one of the first questions she had asked me was whether or not i still worked at a clinic.

whenever i received the 'request for verification' through the mail, one of the requirements it asked for was to verify income for a place named, ""cr cafes"". so i tried googling it, cr cafes.llc had come up and i realized a cafe place i tried working there for a week and quit on january may have been it. and i ended up quitting due to my social anxiety becoming very bad, i'd constantly feel light-headed and i ended up vomiting, so i considered working at the cafe as my first job to be too stressful and ended up quitting. i haven't worked again, either. but.. the lady mentioned that she received a report around may of this year. i wanted to know why exactly that, despite me being at this place for a week on january, she finally receives a report about it now? and why would she ask me if i worked at a clinic if that was my only job? 

what could it mean and what do i need to do prove that i do not work at this place? it's been months and the only verification it's asking for is from june to july regarding income. 

right after the interview, i faxed the disability benefits statement, my id, and a written statement stating that i don't work there before i received this letter. do i just wait to call them by phone and ask about the papers i faxed and hopefully it clears up? or do i need to still submit the income verification?"

"appealing snap benefit amount? i just got my snap benefit amount and was extremely confused. i'm only receiving $32 a month. i'm working an internship and in my interview, i explained that my last two paystubs are higher because of back pay, but that doesn't represent my actual income amount. i also explained that my work would be ending soon so i wouldn't have a source of income. when i look at how much i've made, it totals out to 659 a month, my rent is 500 and utilities are 100ish.  i have less than 100 dollars a month to spend on everything else. how should i go about appealing this process?"
"tx it’s been 6 weeks since i reapplied. are they really that behind? | tx been 3 wks since new application | nothing for over a month and a half i had food stamps earlier this year. i’m not sure why, and the people on the phone couldn’t tell me why, but i lost my food stamps in june. i think part of it may be that i was submitting a lot of changes at once. removing my husband since we’re separated, adding my son since he was just born that month, and then updating my new address because i moved.

i submitted an application on july 6th and after two months of not hearing back i submitted a new application (paper, in person) on august 16th. are they really this behind? is it possible that i’m black listed or something? i don’t even know why i lost my benefits in the first place, they never sent me anything, i’m guessing they just ran out after the three months was up?? but to not be able to get back on it… 

when i log in to my texas benefits app the most recent documents i see from them is about medicaid on 8/3/23. they haven’t sent me any communication in almost two months. this is insane to me. what do i do?

lost my benefits a few months back, my coverage lapsed with no information on why, no letter, and when i called they couldn’t tell me anything either. 

went ahead and went in person after getting the run around on the phone for months, went in on wednesday the 16th and they basically just gave me this receipt thing stating that they received my application and that they would call me. nothing yet and it’s been almost three weeks. 

just worried because i really need my benefits back and was never told why i lost them in the first place. been struggling ever since. wic helps, but obviously not as much as snap does. 

would calling help? is there anything i can do to help the process along? is this a normal wait time? because the last time i waited two months and when i went in person a woman told me it should never take that long and to do a new app. i don’t know what’s normal tbh. 

thank you so much, whoever replies.

i am in texas and on snap since maybe about march or april. well, i just had a baby in june and i moved around that time as well. i had to submit some change forms and now i lapsed in my food stamps. part of the problem is that they kept trying to use my husband's income even though we've been separate since february. so i had to have him removed. 

i called and had them escalate my case july 5th. it's now the middle of august and still nothing. wic has been helping a lot, tuna and bread and milk, etc. i am so grateful for that. but i'm only bringing in about $1300 a month from my disability, $500 goes to my brother for rent, $500 goes to my husband, i barely have anything left for myself at the end of the month and snap helped so much and then for it to just be taken away for seemingly no reason?

i never got a letter saying i was denied, or to report anything within a certain timeframe, nada. nada. and when i login to my ytb dashboard, it does say denied. any time i call, all they tell me is that i wasn't denied and that since it was already escalated there's nothing they or i can do and it's just a waiting game. what do i do? should i try to reapply? should i go up there in person?

a program called mothers and babies helped me, since i have a 5 year old and an 8 week old. they used their emergency funds to get me a $125 walmart gift card and i was able to get some groceries about 2 weeks ago. that was so amazing of them tbh and i don't want to have to ask again because i'm sure there are people who need it more than i do, and i shouldn't have to rely on their emergency rations when i qualify for snap. 

i guess i'm ranting more than anything, and i'm not sure what answer i'll even get or if i provided adequate information.

tldr; i have been on texas food stamps/snap for a few months. only income is from disability. recently separated from my husband. 5 yo and 8 week old. snap randomly stopped around june 6th and they can't tell me why my benefits are out when i call. card is still active. the help line is not very helpful. they escalated my case which is supposed to put me toward the front of the line july 7th. been about 2 months overall and they still just tell me to keep waiting and that they can't tell me why i haven't gotten anything for july and august. 

should i just make a new application? would that be better? do i keep waiting? why can't they tell me anything? none of this makes sense and i hate feeling like i can't provide for my kids and that i'm a terrible mother. 

disclaimer: please don't worry too much, my 5 yo is in school and since my snap is still technically active, he qualified for free breakfast and lunch at school (major win, huge weight off my shoulders) and my 8 week old breast feeds, so it's mostly making dinners and making sure we get enough meat and protein. that's the hardest. making sure we have ground beef or chicken for dinner, etc. that's the part that wic has been helping with, tuna, beans, etc. we will be o.k. <3"
will snap contact my job i’m applying for food stamps. but it will be really embarrassing for my job to know. does he even know if they’re gonna call them? i live in kansas city missouri
do i report new income only if i go over irt? i'm in california la area.
food stamp investigation do you get charged with fraud if you don’t take the documents they request?

"what happens to your snap when your income increases? | separated household members does it just stop or decrease your payments or do you have to pay back what you used?

i currently receive nyc snap and live with my child's father now but he was not on our application previously because he was not living with us before. i have to re-cert, but he and i do not sleep in the same bedroom nor does he eat the food i purchase with snap. he does contribute towards bills and half the rent. his father helped with the baby's daycare cost this summer before she goes to free universal 3k in september.
we also have separate businesses that are not generating much income either. but we both work regular jobs too. 

 questions: 

should i still add him as a household member if he's not eating our food (he's pretty much a roommate at this point)? 

do i report income from self employment if we don't really receive income from it (any revenue is put back into the business for now). i had to pay myself (for covering rent) once earlier in the year due to an emergency, but nothing since. 

what other options do we have to prove income from the business if he doesn't have tax information? and is there a way to report revenue in the negative (it won't let me list zero) or do i just not report it?

do i report her grandfather who is just paying for this past spring and summer (not any upcoming costs after august) for her daycare/summer camp? 

would i possibly still get funding after all is said and done? 

🙈 please be gentle with me, i need positive/constructive responses, not mean critical ones. thank you all ❤️"

"rent reporting question hello all, i’m located in california, specifically sacramento county. 

i’m currently serving with a program called americorps but unfortunately, because of the branch i’m in my volunteer stipend is counted as income and lowers my allotment monthly. so i’m double checking to see if i missed any expenses that could potentially raise the amount i receive. 

which leads me to my question, when reporting rent do i report only the amount i specifically pay or should i have reported the amount listed on the lease not taking into account the portion my roommate pays?"

if i am living with 3 other people, 2 of them i do not share food with (with an exception of a group meal perhaps once every ~30-45 days) and the other individual is my partner. we are not married,  and most of the food i purchase is for my own, but of course we sometimes eat together. i just applied for myself, because we don’t believe she would qualify as a full time student, as well as the previously mentioned reasons. did i waste my time applying? i feel like our situation is very unique, however i’m still in need of food assistance

state: ohio 

i work full time and she is a student, we live with 2 others but they are responsible for their own groceries and we all split rent and utilities. i’ve been told i don’t need to include the other 2 people, but i will include my girlfriend in the application (yes?). she does not have a job due to school, but receives scholarships. my gross income before taxes per pay period (bi-weekly) is low (low wage+job doesn’t allow over ~30 hours weekly due to the nature of the occupation). would it be worth my time to apply?"

"reporting income projections on sale of personal items before they are actually sold - when & how often? in my state of nevada, we are required to report a change in income within 10 days.  that's reasonable, but what threw me was the requirement to report ""projected"" income not yet received, particularly if that is not coming from a predictable source like a wage. 

i plan to sell personal items online but not sure what items and which website and for how much. it's one thing to report these after the event when you know the dollar amounts, but how are you supposed to submit a projection when the item may not sell for months or not at all?  

i was told that just putting up a ""for sale"" sign online anywhere (craigslist, ebay, etc.) counts as ""self-employment date"" with requisite ""projected income"" from the day you upload the ad to be reported as ""change of income"" when you've not received any funds which will still be used to adjust your snap  benefits..?  then when you don't make the money after a time and you take down the ad for not selling to report again that you did not make the said ""projected income""?  the welfare advisor said even panhandlers have to submit projected income as way of example.

however, if you pawn an item for cash, that is not counted as income in most cases according to the welfare counselor, which i suppose is because its considered a loan?  

and putting something on consignment has to be reported even if it may not sell?  

i have health issues that keep me from going out for a regular job and am downsizing to pay my basic bills but this ""projected income"" reporting requirement seems a lot of paperwork on uncertain events and funds since it's not the same as reporting when you actually get the money or a real business with expected streams from accounts receivable.  

would appreciate advise or clarification on what people are doing."

"does snap have access to your bank account? state of florida 



i applied to the snap program a few days ago and had a phone interview. currently i am waiting on acceptance. the only thing i am concerned about is when i filled out my expenses i listedi pay 355 a month on rent (which is true) but its not automatically withdrawn from my bank acocunt as   i am not the main tenant  on the lease. often times i paid the  main tenant cash from side jobs i had and then he deposited it. would this be an issue? same story with my health insurance which i pay out of pocket to my father who’s bank account is linked to my medical plan. how deep do they look? thank you!!"
"is this considered taxable income? this is a question for you guys and girls. 
i lost my job in middle of 2022 and was relying on food stamps. 
in november, i needed money and found out how to make 3d templates online. i sold these through a company and was told that nothing would be reported to the irs unless you make over $20,000 and have more than 200 invoices paid in a year. 
in 2022 - they never issued me a 1099-k so i didn’t report it. 

now this year, my benefits expired in february and i did not recertify or renew, as i don’t need them. my understanding is, everything resets at the start of the new year. so since i didn’t recertify, and didn’t get a 1099-k in 2022 - i didn’t need to report for those 2 months. 

is this correct? if i recertified, i would need to report that as there is a chance of me having a 1099-k this year. 

thoughts?"
"anyone else not received benefits for december yet? i reside in north carolina, and i usually receive my food assistance benefits on the 3rd of every month. it's been that way since i was approved, but for some reason absolutely nothing has come through so far this month. today is already the 6th, and i've reloaded the app to check my food stamps balance a dozen times, yet no funds have been added to the $2.00 i have left from november. 
so i have no idea what's going on. i do realize that for whatever reason the emergency/pandemic additional benefits were delayed for some people last month, including myself. i usually receive that on the 24th, but didn't get it until the 26th. i'm sure it has to do with the holiday, but it seemed odd because i had actually received them a day or two early every other month with holidays previously. seemed like if there was any holiday to ensure people get their food stamps early to avoid delays, thanksgiving would be the one...

anyway, at least that worked out within 48 hours for me. but over 72 hours since the 3rd of december, i'm starting to really worry that something is wrong. is anyone else experiencing the same?

**update**
well, i finally got my benefits a whopping 6 days late. the amount was $30 less than it had been previously for some reason. no clue why."
would i be able to get food stamps for myself? i am 21 and currently live with my dad i am unemployed my father is employed but for some reason he doesn’t buy groceries. for a while now i’ve been eating rice with salsa sauce on it. i can’t force my dad to spend money to buy food for us but i’m starting to feel the effects on my mind and body from just eating rice. and yes he makes more then enough money to buy groceries every week but he just doesn’t. is there anyway i can get food stamps?
"reporting self-employment for household member’s snap benefits i’m self employed (amateur voice-actor) who lives in the same house as someone signing up for snap, and as a household member i’m also needing to fill out some paperwork on my employment. i (semi-consistently) meet the weekly hour requirements to be exempt from all the training stuff, but my actual income isn’t exactly… a thing at this point in my career, and i’m not sure if/how they’ll ask for proof of my self-employment beyond pay-stubs or bank statements.

since i’m just a household member of the actual applicant, how much paperwork, and what kind, will they put me through, and what kind of questions can i expect, and what kind of proof might they ask for? i apologize for stacking so many questions in one post, but this system is so damn opaque."

"submitted renewal but account shows closed | ga interview answers do not match details report i live in ga and did my online renewal 2 days before the cutoff date. i have the tracking number but my case shows the status as closed. when i go to submitted renewals there is nothing there.

can anyone offer any possible explanation or advice for my situation?

i receive my benefits on the 11th of each month. i submitted my renewal in july, it was due august 31st. my september benefits were not deposited on the 11th but i got a phone call for the renewal interview on 9/20. i am in troup county but the caseworker said she is in fulton county but helping out other offices. we were on the phone for 45 minutes and i answered all her questions and had uploaded the documents to verify. we are a family of 4 and my bf lost his job when we had car troubles. the lady told me i was approved and that she would be getting some funds sent to us asap. the next day we did get a small deposit but it was a fraction of our prior benefit amount when we were a family of three. i thought maybe it was prorated and we'd only get a small amount to tie us over until the next deposit date. i went into the gateway website and see i was emailed a notice stating our new amount, which is less than half of the previous amount. today i went online and read the full details and it shows us paying no utilities or rent (the amount shows zero) despite us paying rent and all utilities. it also shows my partner as still working for a company that he left over a year ago in 2022, and the amount it shows he makes a month far exceeds his actual salary, even before taxes and deductions. i tried to reach someone for clarification but never got a call back or answer. i submitted a change form putting out rent and utilities amount and the end date of the job they have listed. my question is was the caseworker just frazzled and possibly put in someone else's information down in my interview answers? or am i misreading the details on the report? i see possibly making one or two small mistakes but this seems very odd to have this much misinformation in my file. when asked how we are paying our bills currently i informed the caseworker that my son's grandparents and aunts are dropping off items and worked out the rent with the landlord directly. we did not ever get any cash from them."

i’m in maryland.

i was approved for emergency benefits last week, so i checked my account a little later but saw february 2023 as the next payment date. 

i planned to call social services this morning to check on it, but then discovered that around $600 was loaded onto my card. i am single with no kids.

i know they are giving out extra for the pandemic, but that’s got to be a mistake, right? in the past, i’ve received around $200/month."

just wondering when to report because i don't wanna have the supplement at the end of the month to idk, not to through, i guess? would be nice to have while we catch up on bills and whatnot.

"my husband is ""not eligible"" because his income will decrease benefits? covid-19 additional benefit we got a letter in the mail today from idaho's department of health and welfare about an additional one time dollar amount being added to our snap benefits for the month of january. 

below, where it lists who in the household is eligible it says my husband is not due to his income making benefits lower, which seems really strange to me...

is this just for the covid relief benefits? i'm pretty certain on our initial letter it says he's eligible.

"$16 a month in food benefits? (michigan) this doesn't sound right to me but i'm really not sure, i could be wrong so i wanted y'alls opinion. i have an idea why due to unverified rent costs but i'm really not sure. i received a letter today from dhs saying that i qualify for assistance but only $16 per month.

i currently roughly make $330 a week, 1,386 a month and $16,632 a year. my rent costs $800 per month, $9,600 per year leaving me with $7032 for the year.

i also have an electric, internet, phone bill and transportation costs.

my electric bill it's about $60 a month, $720 a year, bringing the total money i have to spend down to $6,322

my transportation costs about $30 a week, $1,512 a year leaving me with $4,810 to spend for the year

phone bill is $35 a month, $420 a year. bringing the total i have left to $4,399

internet is $60 a month, $720 a year leaving me with a grand total of $3,679 to spend that year.

i don't know what expenses are accounted for when determining what your benefit amount will be but $16 per month seems low to me..i honestly don't know so i wanted to ask your opinions. i saw a link on one of the posts in here about a benefit calculator but cannot get it to work. not sure why. maybe it's because on trying to use it on a phone. 

thanks for taking the time to read this and any input will be greatly appreciated!"

"nyc my car i had previously financed had been flooded due to the recent coastal flood. i was looking to finance another car when i was offered to do a lease as it would be cheaper. in june i left my son's father due to a dv situation. i am still in court with an oop and fighting foe custody. my question is if i lease would that help my case regarding expenses without cutting odd my medicaid? i need a car due to my other son's father refusing to drive at all (already in court pushing for a trial w/attorney), or because i reside in nyc would it not be considered a necessity? i was supposed to work ft but due to the uncooperativeness of driving, i work about 31 hours a week. i have 2 kids 1 in kindergarten, and the other in a daycare. if i were to lease(as opposed to finance) would hra see it as a necessary expense as opposed to a luxury when i just need to get my kids to school/daycare so i can go to work and support them?"

"childcare expense deducation question for y'all! 

i am trying to understand the childcare deduction expense. according to the website below, the expense is not reserved for households with no nonworking adults. however, when i did my interview, the casework said i could not include that deduction because there is a nonworking adult in my household. i work, but my partner does not currently work as they lost their job due to covid. thoughts? i cannot find anything in the literature or policies about this exclusion. 

[https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-food-stamp-dependent-care-deduction](https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-food-stamp-dependent-care-deduction)

""according to the regulations, households are eligible if they contain an individual who is employed, looking for work, or attending school or training. federal regulations place no additional restrictions on the deduction, such as limiting it to households with no nonworking adults. nor do households necessarily lose the deduction if a household member loses his or her job, because individuals seeking employment also qualify. and, although some households may receive a child care subsidy, they still may have allowable expenses, such as co-payments or transportation costs."""

since i've been injured i've received financial support from a family member (sent in multiple small irregular payments). in my application i estimated how much i was getting and in my phone interview i told the interviewer that i was not sure the exact number and needed to go through and count/verify. she didn't seem to care / need an exact number so i didn't really think much about it after that.

now that i'm trying to compile my documents i've realized that i under reported the amount on my application by a few hundred dollars. i'm not sure what to do next as i can't edit my app at this point. do i call the interview number again and try to let them know?

so, i didn't get february's deposit (which was due on the 16th) until the beginning of march. now march 16th has come and gone and i don't have my deposit for this month either. it's so frustrating and stressful to slowly watch my groceries run out and know i can't afford to go get more. it just feels like a clock counting down the days until my family can't eat."

my friend is on snap for maybe a year now, coming up on a recert i think, and is/was/will be selling some things. i said i would ask here since you never know if caseworkers will flag someone’s case based on their inquiries. not talking big bucks, selling things like patio furniture and some household stuff. these are minimal monies. she also helps her neighbor on occasion walking the dog, tending to the garden in summer.  again, maybe $20 cash here and there.

so my account was closed in april for the work thing because i couldn't get a hold of anybody at dcf. then i applied again last month and now they closed my account again for the work thing and terminated my benefits. they said the call careersource and the lady didn't know what i was talking about at all. but i finally got hold on someone but she told me that she would have someone call me tomorrow that handles the snap benefits. my question: is it too late to get my sanction lifted even though they stopped by benefits at the end of june? should i just re apply again?

did my first application in august. got accepted. it ran until january. renewed in february and then they sent me a letter this month about work requirements and shit. i'm homeless. i couldn't get thru to them on the phone so my stamps got terminated. sorry if this is all over the place. i'm specifically live in broward county"

timeline

*renewal due on nov 30, 2020

*i sent renewal on nov 22, 2020

*i sent documents on nov 23, 2020

i did not receive any notices or any request for
 any other documents.  not by mail, not by
 email.

my food benefits are deposited on the 3rd of every month. 
* december 3rd, they were not deposited? 


i called 211texas, after being on hold for 59 minutes, ( on a pre paid  limited minutes phone)
the person i spoke to said, they didnt get deposited because i have to do an interview,
which is scheduled for dec 8. 


at the end of july, after weeks of fighting to reinstate my benefits that had been wrongfully suspended in may, hhs agreed that the suspension was an error. but i had to go through the application process anyways, after completing that, and having an interview, my benafits were reinstated, but for only half the amount i had been getting. 
just grateful for anything.
* done *


august i moved into a apartment after being homeless, so i had to submit a change. 
i submitted the change, then i had to send lease, bills, income. hit several bumps in the road, but completed that.
* done *


november received a notice to renew my snap and then another notice to renew my medicaid.
completed that on nov 23, but now again bumps in the road.  i dont understand why i would need to renew snap at this time anyways?
i did the application and interview just 3 months ago, sent all required information.  then again 2 months ago when reported the move, and update on the new living expenses, sent everything then as well. 


now, no benefits for december, i will never get back on my feet with these problems with hhs, that result in disconnected utilities, late fees, reconnection fees, or hungry kids. 

can someone please tell me what if anything i can do? its only dec 6, and im already having to use money that is supposed to  be used on our electric bill on food, so by the next deposit day jan 3, ( if theres no other problems after doing an interview), i will for sure be behind on rent, and have lost utilities. 
thank you for any help, 
stay well.

everyone needs to be double checking what they spend against their itemized lone star card statements.  mine keeps showing different amounts being authorized each month, but when i add up all the amounts ive spent, its showing i didnt actually receieve what the statement says i did.  
example my deposit day is the 5th of each month.  my allotment is $335.00 a month. so my statement says authorized benefit $335.00 on jan 5. 
then on the 15th it says authorized benefit $335.00, then on the 17th it says authorized benefit amount $ 84.00. 
when i add up the amounts ive spent since the 5th, it shows ive spent $335.00 and my balance is $0.  
the ""authorized benefit amount on the 15th and on the 17th, were not added to my account, even though the statement shows they were?"

"need food stamp advice please (florida) hi there. i've had food stamps for a while and have never gotten an e&t notice. i submitted my renewed food stamps application and on my application my hours were different from my paystubs which i explained are because my work is cutting peoples hours due to lack of business. i received a e&t notice in the mail that it was mandatory for me to participate since i didn't meet the work requirement. i forgot to add on my application that i work roughly 20 hours a week online for a remote job that pays me pennies, but still the work is being put in and i honestly didn't add it to the application because i didn't think it counted. i ended up trying to submit a ""good cause"" addendum to my application stating that and then panicked and closed my case because i didn't know what to do.

&#x200b;

my question is, since i didn't sign up for the e&t program (the deadline didn't happen yet) will something happen since i canceled my account? will the food stamps money that i received for this month of food stamps be revoked? any advice is extremely appreciated, this has never happened before and i'm scared because i have never been able to contact a representative for a question and since the interviews are waived right now it's even more impossible.

thanks in advance."
"two months since i applied and i’m still waiting i don’t really know what to do anymore, i take a day out of the week to go and check on my case in person and sometimes i call. all they tell me is to keep waiting. like if it weren’t for the food the shelter provides, i’d be starving and bugging people i know to spare me some food. 

i spoke to other people on the shelter who got their case approved within a matter of a couple weeks. meanwhile a few others who already have cases have been waiting for a long time to get there next payment. 

i’m in nyc is there something going on here that’s affecting peoples cases?"

"texas i was approved for food stamps in march of this year based off of my va disability. i was going to school so i was receiving bah. i didn’t get a food stamp card until may so that’s when i started actively using the food stamps.
i ended school at the end of june, and i never put on my application i received bah because it is non taxable. i didn’t know you had to report that as income? i have been researching and unfortunately, i was wrong and you do have to report it as income.
so i reported myself for the income and i received a letter stating snap benefits wants me to provide all kinds of information, even bank statements.
obviously, i am willing to pay the money back. it’s near 2k of food stamps (up until now). i didn’t receive bah in july, august or september. so as of july i would have qualified for food stamps.
will i be facing jail time? do i need an attorney?"

"[in] college student applying for ebt i’m a college student in indiana and i work 11 hours a week. i understand that the requirement to be considered is 20 hours a week, but i simply have no room in my very busy schedule. i’m greatly suffering from financial anxiety to the point where i am receiving psychotherapy to help the side effects (worthlessness, skipping meals, resentment against wealthier students etc.). i have a checking account with 12,000$ on it, however it is not my money and i am budgeted to 50$ a week for groceries, not including the income i get from my part time job which is around 200$ biweekly. i save this money up for rent and electricity bill which ranges from 500-600$ a month. the other person on the join account is my mother. my father does not work due to behavioral issues and so my money is used for my mother and siblings. however, i’m under so much stress that food stamps would help greatly with. i was also told by this subreddit that 5,000$ or more in your checking will disqualify you. i applied previously but was denied because the documents did not reach the office in time. considering these factors, would i still be ineligible for food stamps?"
"snap scam just wanted to let everyone know that there is a scam going around. i work in pennsylvania and have seen it there, but it could be operating in other states. the one i have seen is a text message like the one attached will be sent. when the number is called, immediately it asks for your ebt card # and pin. once they have that, the scammer is getting the benefits and depleting the accounts by purchasing at various stores. i've heard that others are getting calls.

do not ever give out your pin number to anyone! if you get a text like this and are unsure, call the number on the back of your card or your local assistance office instead."
"ebt tips i have a few tips for ebt food stamps users. i just recently found out that the starbucks in my local safeway works with my ebt food benefits. i’m not sure if this works at every safeway but give it a try. if you feel embarrassed if you are declined just grab a bag of chips. ask them to scan that to pay for it there so if your drink doesn’t get covered at least they’ll just think you were trying to use your benefits only for the bag of chips. it’s worth a try. 
i also use the ‘fetch’ rewards app to scan my receipts for my ebt purchases and any other purchases. you can get rewards gift cards after getting up to a certain amount of points. 
also if you’re trying to get valentines for your kids ‘usually’ any valentines with food in it (candy usually) is eligible for ebt. 
if you can not shop at your store because you don’t have time or physically can’t or whatever your reason then just know with safeway pickup and walmart grocery pickup you can order through the app and use your ebt card. i like this better because it will decipher what items are eligible for ebt and what ones are not. 
i hope this helps some of you!"
"has anyone had your ebt declined but money still removed from your balance? i bought groceries on saturday and ran my ebt to cover $40 of my purchase (the rest was non-ebt items) in california. the card was declined, saying i had only $1 left - i immediately assumed fraud, but when i checked, the $1 balance was because the $40 had already been added to my transaction list. had to put the full amount on my debit card and now i don’t have food money left until aug 7. manager of the grocery store showed me they never received money from my ebt and suspects it’s a hold placed on my account that hasn’t been removed. i’m trying to reach someone in the dpss hotline but it’s not ideal to have to call on the first of the month it seems. hoping someone can say that they’ve had an ebt hold that goes away quickly 😫"

"application help.. again | need help filling out application (kentucky)

hi guys, i’ve previously made a post about needing help with my application and i’ve followed what you guys said, but that had lead me to another issue. 

from where i applied for snap benefits in 2020, it still has me as the head of household on the application and i’m no longer that. my roommate is the hoh. i have no idea how to completely start over the application. 

another thing i’ve seen is that i can’t select who is and isn’t applying for the benefits under the “add a member of household” section. the option is greyed out and it won’t let me choose who is and isn’t applying. i don’t want my roommate applying, it’s just for me.

i have previously had snap back during when covid first hit. 
i’m having a hard time understanding if i need to list my roommate or not?
we do not share food and i do pay rent. i pay about 1/3 of it. 
other resources online are saying i don’t need to list her, because we don’t share food, but if i try to do the application without someone else on there, it’s asking me to get a form filled out.
i live in kentucky and if anyone also lives here and has filled it out recently please message me or help me through this. ❤️"

wtl;dr i’m an over thinker to the max, what do they want to hear in the interview!! 😅 am i even allowed to ask this. i’m not scamming the system. swear. please read my story. i deserve this, and will only use it for however long it takes me to get on my feet literally ♿️♿️


tl;dr  the question is very hung up on interview wise “ are you buying and preparing meals together”  i mean… yes and no..  he’s my boyfriend but also when i was very weak he kept an eye on me and helped me with a lot of things and took me to all of my appointments  ect. but he does not expect me to provide for him, i want to maintain my independence! if i were to move out tomorrow i want to be able to support myself. we are not locked in ( this sounds awful as this man is my person, my other half) 


i feel i have sort of a complex case, but i’m not sure! this is all so new to me and i’m trying to figure it all out on my own! i’m 27 and i was born with a congenital myopathy. i’ve been disabled my whole life but adapted and made things work up until about 2 years ago when my muscle weakness progressed and i had to stop working as a hairstylist and became wheelchair bound… i since have received ssdi after months of fighting for it because i didn’t have a formal diagnosis even though my brother has the same disease😅 anyways! 
 i live with my boyfriend/partner we are extremely serious as he has been here through this whole ordeal and never given up on me!! but want to maintain my independence!!!! i want to support myself and help with things around the house, but ssdi only goes so far with the price of groceries the way they are and things i’m buying for myself to exercise at home for physical therapy. my question is i’m terrified about the interview! i’m afraid they are going to deny me because 1. i “ live” with my boyfriend  but i have no proof i have no utilities in my name, i just pay him half of the utilities, and i pay him rent since i didn’t have any income when i first regressed and was very sick he took care of me entirely. i owe him everything! so when they ask “ are you buying and preparing meals together”  i mean yes…. but ultimately i’m doing this for me. he doesn’t expect me or want me to provide for him! he wants to provide for me, but that’s not feasible in this economy right now. sorry this is absolutely all over the place rambling."
"amazon increased the threshold for snap users' free delivery. delivery is only free for $150+ orders kind of upset about this. feel free to use the comments to complain too!

i use amazon fresh mostly for heavier items like milk or flour or sometimes meat. i don't have a car but i live close enough to a grocery store that i can walk but far enough that carrying heavy items takes a toll on my back. my amazon fresh orders are always around $35 so the old price for free delivery was perfect. $150 is over half my monthly allotment so really not possible for me to spend that much on amazon fresh. considering snap is for people with low income, kind of a dick move of amazon for trying to get us to pay more."
"should i cancel my snap and medicaid assistance? after having a phone interview, i'm afraid i may be investigated for fraud since i never mentioned that my child's father is deceased. since i'm a single mother attending university, i have been receiving $350+ in snap benefits plus medicaid for me and my child. the interview took place early in the morning so when the interviewer asked for the name of my child's father i accidently told her the name of the man i am dating. then retracted an told her the name of my child's birth father who is now deceased. she sounded very shocked and...irritated as she repeadedly demanded to know why i wasn't recieving something called social security benefits for my child. i told her i was only interested in recieving medicaid and snap. after putting me on hold for a little while, she instructed me to upload documentation regarding proof of enrollment then abruptly ended the interview. 

i just spent some time researching possible penalties and processes involving snap fraud investigation teams, court cases etc. as a full time student and mom i have zero time to go through something as stressful as this. i can't imagine having to find an attorney and go through the motions of it all. i'm considering just looking for work and canceling any and all assistance from the state. it has been a rocky road dealing with false renewal notices when i already renewed and issues locating my caseworker, etc. id rather just end it all now.

if i am accused of fraud, will cancelling all assistance prevent me from having to deal with any further issues?"
"per-purchase limit? i'm very lucky to have around $600 of calfresh benefits saved up, but the card only let me spend roughly $150 on my last costco run. the rest had to be paid via credit card. this is the largest grocery run i've made since getting snap - is there a per-purchase spending limit i didn't know about? everything i bought was food."
"texas ebt: escalated application and still no call after 3 months if anyone can help me…i’ve applied for food stamps and have not heard back from them regarding my case. 
i’ve called numerous times, a few times was told they didn’t escalate the case correctly. and the last week was told the same thing but this time it will be done correctly. and yet still no call. would it be better to go to a nearby office? can they do the interviews there? i just would like to know if i am approved or not."
"what does this mean? hello everyone. i am a resident of florida and renewed my benefits. however, for pebt and snap it says “processing” however, when i click on more info, it says “technical question _technical verification” does anyone know what that means exactly? i’ve never saw that before in my life. any answers are appreciated!"
"if i don't spend all of one month's benefits, and it rolls over to the next month's benefits, will they question me? i live by myself, so i spend about just over sixty for my groceries in one shopping trip. 'course if i'm running low on something i buy more of it but if i have a good amount of one month's benefits that roll over and add to another month's, and i have quite a bit saved up, will that raise a red flag and will they question me about it? will they stop my benefits or reduce those benefits?"
texas p ebt i submitted my pebt claims on 12/16 and still nothing. as of november i no longer qualify for snap but wouldn't my pebt be loaded on my old card? kinda desperate this close to christmas and the kids being out of school for winter break.

"snap call so my step daughter left her husband due to verbal meanness (apparently i cant say the a word?) and moved in with her mother who will let her and her son stay there as long as she can support herself (mom is fully paying her sons bills and simply cant afford it). i told her to apply for snap, medicaid, etc...
the lady from public aid called her to tell her she doesnt believe she left her husband and would refer it to fraud if she persisted? what? i am appaled. based on what? never met her, first time talking to her...my daughter was just bawling
next steps? we are in illinois"
"question about first month/rollover hi, i just received my ebt (fl) card today (loaded with the first month's balance.) according to the renewal chart, our card should refill on the 19th. does this still happen in your first month? i show that the card was loaded on the 9th.

i don't want to burn through the benefits we have left if they aren't going to re up on the 19th, but if they are going to reset i would like to know so we can stock up on pantry items that will last. thanks for your help."
"important - the 3rd stimulus bill renews maximum snap benefits for your family size if you qualify at all! if you have hesitated to apply because you think you'll only get a few bucks, now's the time to give it another shot.

a friend of mine with 5 kids was only getting $300 a month. for the time being, she has been getting $1,200 a month(!!), **she got some back-dated snap at this maximum level and she'll be getting over $10,000 in snap through september 2021**.

note that it's higher than snap maximum benefit charts you may have seen because there is also a temporary 15% short-term increase to all snap benefits that is now extended through at least september and (as per the bill) should remain in place ""for as long as needed based on economic conditions"".

tl;dr  **maximum snap for all those who qualify + 15% extra = big big help over the next 6 months**. go apply!"
"over threshold? i'm a student with ebt snap benefit and i get about $281 a month with a threshold of $1470. for some context, i work for doordash when i'm home from college which is only every summer, so i have a ""seasonal"" job that i only work at home. in this job, i use my car which uses a lot of gas but it's extremely necessary to pay gas in order to do my job. this past month, however, i just recently calculated that i made about $1700 which i'd obviously way over the threshold, but this is the gross income from july.

is it possible to deduct the gas costs from this since it's a dire necessity in order for me to do my job? after deducting the gas prices (almost $500 in gas a month) my income comes down to $1200. could i talk to my case worker about this? i'm in california btw."
"i live in florida and am at my wits end so my hours at work are generally getting lower (8) per average and have been trying to get in touch with the my access florida people to get food stamps. every time i have filled out an application, i am asked for a phone interview with a specific phone number. every single day i try calling that number, i go to voicemail. every. single. time.   


i have no idea what's going on or what, but if you give my a phone number to call, i expect someone to actually be there. for the record, i have put in over six applications so far."
"i have work study and wanted to apply for food stamps. i technically work 20hours a week and get paid biweekly, but some weeks school gets busy so i technically only do 30-37 hours every 2 weeks. so i still qualify? | how would i fill out the job and other income sections if i’m working a federal work study job. where would i put the amount i make. would i subtract rent out of it? would i list this as a job? or just say no job and add to other income area? if i show my paystubs and they’re not exactly 20 hours a week. or 40 hours (every two weeks) in my case since i get paid biweekly. will this effect me getting food stamps? some biweekly paychecks i work around 30-35 hours. school gets busy and i have to take off for tutoring etc. will this be a problem? and how current does the paycheck have to be ? can i submit one where i almost maxed my hours but this was over the summer so sometime in august? 

edit: i live in in new york. also just to clarify if i have federal work study i do not need to meet the 20 working hours a week minimum? just the poverty line minimum?

i live in new york. i really need advice on how to fill this portion out. thank you. also should i put i rent a family/friend or roomer. i don’t want to cause any problems so i was gnna go with roomer to be safe. what’s your advice on this?"
"can anyone explain p-ebt? i'm in ny and as i understand it the state has been approved for p-ebt. i have some questions about this. 

first, is this separate from the original covid-19 extra benefits?

second, does anyone know when to expect these benefits to be issued? 

and finally, do the p-ebt benefits extend only until when school would have let out had it stayed in session? (in ny kids typically get out of school at the end of june.) or is it indefinite?"
help! so the state decided i actually made too much and want me to pay back all the benefits i received. on the official document where they made their decision they made a mistake on the dollar amount i owe back. does this mean i can appeal it/have it nullified?
"missing food stamps | what’s next ? | closed cases nyc so basically every month i get two food stamps deposits. the regular one & then the extra stamps …. i had an issue with my food stamp case that wasn’t my fault but was eventually sorted out . so i received five months delayed . however at the beginning of january they posted my regular stamps for the five months but they didn’t post the extra stamps & it’s already 01/31. they posted the extra stamps for january about 3 days ago but i’m missing december , november, october, september and august …. what should i do to obtain this … i’m in nyc

"had to apply for pfml, feeling embarrassed i’m in ma. the last time i worked was august 2022. my case worker told me i need to apply for “paid family and medical leave” benefits to qualify for cash assistance and food stamps. 

i haven’t worked for almost a year so i know i won’t be approved but they said they just need something to see my application is pending or a denial letter. i also marked on the application that i “told my employer i was taking leave” because i did tell them i was quitting. but it’s been almost a year, i never told them i was applying for pfml so will i get in trouble for this? 

i had to get my nurse practitioner to sign off on a form stating i have mental illnesses that decrease my ability to support myself. i had to take a picture of this form an upload it to complete the application, and it says my employer will see this form to evaluate my application. i was thinking of withdrawing the application because i was embarrassed my previous boss will see it and will likely tell the entire office. but when i went to check the status of my application it shows my employer has already seen the application and i’m just waiting on a decision from dmfl. its especially embarrassing since i know they’re probably thinking i’m just lazy and trying to get money off of them. i feel like i want to email them to apologize and let them know the situation but i feel that would be too much"

"snap receipt public record on background check in ny? | family loan assistance impact question | nyc bank account verification question hi i live in new york city and i am considering applying for snap.  while i qualify for sure, i am concerned whether my receipt of snap is something that would be discoverable or public record in a background check for employment.  my previous and hopefully future career is in a field that would likely not look favorable on someone who has received such welfare aid. i know they should not take this aid into consideration, but the reality is if it is discoverable they would.  anyone know if snap receipt is accessible by those running a background check using your social security number?  thanks.

  

h - i live in nyc and have a question about how cash loans from family impact eligibility. i am married with 2 children 5 and under (3 & 5). i have had no income for almost 2 years due to losing job after business went south and then inability to find work afterwards combined with some family health problems that required me to be at home for an extended time frame (but which are now concluded). i have lived off unemployment, savings and credit cards and more recently have been receiving assistance via loans from immediate family (deposited in my bank account via check) that i am expected to pay back when re-employed. never wanted to take snap because always thought would be able to be reemployed quicker than occurred and on some level didn’t think i deserved it and had savings to compensate - but now that is gone except for \~5k that i will burn through in near future (and frankly is a level of cash i'd like to hold onto for an absolute emergency). family loan assistance is maxed out and will not continue going forward but i did receive help last month. 

first, am i subject to an asset test with 2 kids under 5 but no income and thus do i have to i use up that 5k before i apply - my impression was in ny with young dependents that asset test was waived (so i could hold onto 5k for emergency - you never know with young kids)? 

second, with regard to the family loans, do i have to report that? while i have received a significant sum on monthly basis for last 6 months (\~3k month, please i know how lucky i am to have that kind of financial help so please no hate) help cover living expenses, that is ending now and frankly i am hoping to partly replace it with snap until i can find employment? would it be viewed differently if they gave me a 1x $20k loan/gift instead of 3k/month for 6 months?

hi live in nyc and have a question re: snap application process. i don't mind if snap checks my bank account in some general online database to confirm account balances (or via me uploading copies), but i am concerned that if they contact my bank directly to verify that it could create a red flag at my bank, where i also have credit cards that i rely on to pay bills. if the bank closed my checking account or a linked credit cards as a result of a snap inquiry that would make life even more difficult - is that something that could happen? or is all verification done via some 3rd party database and my bank would never know? thanks for the help"

hi everyone, i applied for snap three times and got denied twice and approved for one month, but due to the paperwork i sent in there was a “problem” which led to them cutting me off completely with no warning and had to re-apply. this time around i waited over a month just for them not to contact me i waited on the phone for a total of 3 hours to be able to have my interview. i made sure and double checked everything i submitted all the documents exactly what they wanted and still got denied because of “all persons in your case failed are non-financial” what does this mean?

"sad caseworker vent | nc. please check cards before using them. | nc abawd age range changing | nc clients: income base period changed please delete if this is not allowed. i've been doing this job for 5.5 years now, and some things just still get me emotionally. quick background info: i'm not normally an emotional person--as in i don't cry over sad movies, books, etc. i do feel the sadness but there's no physical reaction. however, this job just gets me some days. so, i'm sitting here at my desk with teary eyes looking at a note that was submitted with a household's recertification that says, ""help, please. i need more than $23. please."" it kills me that all i can do is apologize, explain the budget, and provide them with information on other food assistance options. i've managed to be less emotionally involved other years, but things like this are hard to shake. 

thanks to anyone who reads this. thanks to the mods if this post stays up--oh and thanks for my flair. i was excited when i first saw it. anyway, i just had to get this out there. no responses needed.

i'm angry just typing this..... 

we just received a letter from the state this morning indicating that ""due to the large number of cards that have been potentially compromised, a decision was made to reissue new cards to recipients whose cards were potentially compromised."" this was done without prior notification to the recipients affected. those affected will have absolutely no access to their benefits until a new card is received and activated. we have no way to tell who was affected by this at the county level unless you call to find out why your card isn't working. the ebt call center is just as limited on this information as we are.

so, please check your card to ensure it is active before attempting to use it. if you find that you were affected by this, your new card should arrive within 3 to 7 business days. please ensure that your mailing address is up to date with us otherwise the card would have been sent to the last known address.

if you're affected and have no food until the new card arrives, please contact your local office for a community resource list or call 211.

the able bodied adults without dependents (abawd) working policy is changing next month to include 50 year olds. in october, it is changing again to include 51 and 52 year olds. letters were automatically created and sent by the state but, at the county level, we do not have access to it and knew nothing about it until after they had been mailed. 

if you are between the ages of 50 and 52 with no minors in your care, not currently working or receiving ssi or ssdi, please contact your worker if you believe you are meeting an exemption to the 20 hour per week requirement.

i wanted to post about this in case it might save just one person some trouble. 

this change occurred a few months ago, but we have seen many clients provide the wrong paystubs for income verification for their recert. for over 5 years, the rule has been to provide all income for the month prior to recert. for example, recert due in april then you would turn in all income received in march. no reason to expect it to change.

now, we are required to use all income received for the 30 days prior to the agency receiving your recert. the state did update the first page of the recert papers to say this, but the print is so small and at the bottom that many miss it. i know i would if i had been  turning in the prior month for years and years without issue. to make it somewhat more confusing, the 30 day time frame does not include the date turned in either. this new base period also applies to changes as well as applications. 

however, income base periods for odd jobs, self employment, and child support have not changed. odd jobs and self employment are still for the prior 12 months or previous year tax return. child support received is still the three months prior to the month the recert was due. there are more rules and situations where this could vary, but i'm not going to get into them since it's not the purpose of this post.

some examples using the new base period:

 --app received by the agency on 4/3. we would need all income received from 3/4 to 4/2. 

--recert received by the agency on 4/30. we would need all income received from 3/31 to 4/29.

--new job reported 5/9 to worker after you've crossed the income reporijng threshold for your household in april. we would need all income received from 4/9 to 5/8. 

knowing this can make the difference in how quickly your recert is processed. if we have the correct paystubs and need nothing else then it can be processed asap. if we can't use half of the paystubs provided, then we have to request the ones that are missing."

"ny card hacked my card was hacked somehow. $734 was spent at a walmart in napa. i reported the card stolen, a new one is coming but the money won’t be replenished. i filed a police report. i was given this number 8004249121 to call and try to report the fraud but there’s no option to, it seems to just be recorded info. i went to the office and was told to apply for a “one shot” but when i called for my interview they refused because “this isn’t what this is for” and gave me a number to call…. the same general ebt number.

"i am food stamp beneficiary but i am not the cardholder. to explain, me, and my three younger siblings are all food stamp/medicaid beneficiaries. my siblings are all minors. i’ll be coming up 21 next month. so, my mom basically reports that where me and my grandma live is where she and my brothers live. the thing is, as far as my local social services department is concerned, they consider my mother to be the head of household so the card is in her name even though she has no benefits that she receives in her name. i really could use some advice or what my options are to be able to get my portion of the funds. i know i can report my mother which i have no issue with but she’s already gotten me and my grandparents involved with her legal issues too long and i don’t want to stress my grandmother out. feel free to ask any questions and i’ll clarify. for reference, this is in north carolina."
"confused about medical expenses - ri | how are you filling in the gaps if your snap has been cut in half? | extra large pandemic emergency payment--why? - rhode island | will lower rent affect my snap? | how will medicare premium payment affect my snap? ri | decreased income - when will it take effect? ri i got a boilerplate letter from ri snap about making sure i claim medical expenses. two questions. how do i know if they know i am paying $154 for medicare part a &b and $54 for medicare part d? i just recertified in january and i don't see a copy of my application online to check for that. they only have an old application from a few years ago.

when they say monthly medical expenses that exceed $35, does that mean it has to be every month? i just had a copay for $115 for a ct scan. should i report that, and how do i do it? please don't say i have to do the whole application over again. i might also have another big copay coming up for a nerve conduction study. i just do not know how i'm supposed to report this. or if i should.

my snap was cut in half due to my rent dropping, although this month i still got the pandemic bonus. i signed up for the senior commodity food box (which is once/mo and i think it equates to $50 worth of food) and i started going to a food pantry twice/month too, and it has made a huge difference. i've also been buying in bulk from the farmer's market about once a month because with snap they give you 50% off on produce, which makes it less than the grocery store for fresher stuff. doesn't include eggs or milk, though, just produce. i didn't think i'd be able to make it on $138/mo snap, but i think i will actually be okay even when the pandemic thing is absent next month. i am wondering how other people are managing the cut. maybe there is something i have missed.

i filed an interim report at the end of december, and my benefits were cut from $285 to $138 because i am paying much less rent now. i got the $138 on the first and expected the last pandemic payment of $95 on the 3rd. instead, i got $143. i can't call ri dhs because i have never once gotten to talk to a human being there; last time i called (at 5 after opening), there were 160 people before me. anyone have an idea why i got $143 instead of $95? could it mean they adjusted my benefit to $186? and do you think it's okay to spend it?

just an update: my decreased rent decreased my snap from $285 to $138. not as bad as i feared, but a big hit, especially with the emergency $95 disappearing.
-------------
i moved from a loft where i was paying $1k/mo including utilities to senior affordable housing, where i pay $300 including utilities. just completed interim report but am worried that now my snap will be cut. my gross income has gone down and is now $1144. i'm a senior. i have been receiving max snap since august.

i made a mistake. $1144 is my gross earned income. my unearned income is $1104 (social security). so the whole enchilada is $2248. my net income is about half that.

i just qualified for medicare premium payment in ri, which means my social security retirement benefit should go from $934 to $1105. right now i am getting $279 in food stamps. how much of a cut will this increase mean to my stamps?

my earned income for the first quarter of this year is looking to be 1/3 of what it was last year on average. i expect that to continue; just making a lot less now. i'm going to fill out a change form at the end of this month about that and about excess medical costs. will they then change my benefits going back to january or will it only make a difference going forward?"
"if i apply for snap do i risk jeopardizing my brother’s disability benifits? sorry for the long post! it's just a really specific situation and the kind workers i talk to keep giving me conflicting information.

i live with my parents, 2 other people, and severely disabled brother. i don't know if my brother is considered a separate household, part of mine, or part of my parents. he is a tennant in their house (his ssi pays for his rent), and my parents claim him as a dependent as they cover 50% of his total expenses. i cover the other 50%, which includes his food. as his primary caretaker, i am the one responsible for making sure he is fed, clothed, clean, receives all his medication/therapy, and so on. the state pays for a portion of his day program. all other time i am with him. i manage (buy and cook) his food to ensure he is fed nutrious food that aligns with his dietary restrictions. this arrangement — me, his primary caretaker, meeting 100% of his needs and paying for 50% of his expenses, my parents, his legal guardian, renting him a place to live and paying for the other 50% of his expenses — is exactly how his caseworker and benefit attorney has guided us to do.

i'm considering applying for snap for myself but lost about who is considered part of my household and terrified to mess it up. everyone in the house buy their own groceries outside of my brother; i provide, pay for, and prepare most of his food (there are two dinners a year i do not pay for). i sometimes cook for other members in my household in our shared kitchen using their groceries that they bought. mostly for my parents who are elderly, but also for the convenience of others. we don't eat together or share food otherwise. just share a roof and split bills (my share is ~$650). 

while the benefit office says he could be a separate household, his case manager and benefit attorney say he is part of my parents' household. now i'm worried i'd somehow disqualify him for his current benefits (ssi) by me paying for his food specifically *or* by me applying for snap. for the record, i'm not looking to apply for snap for my brother ... it's just that to cover 50% of his expenses, i'm left with very little for myself. i'm kinda just now realizing i need to prioritize myself, and feeding myself seems like a good start. my parents don't want me to apply because it goes against their beliefs, but ... if it won't sabotage my brother's current benifits (i sure as heck can not afford to add half his rent and day program tuition to what i owe for him), i think this could be the leg up out of this tough situation."
"food stamps asking for my info, i'm not on the benefits food stamps (tx) reached out to my tenant earlier this month asking for my information (citizenship, income, time of move into residence). i am the owner of the house and not on the benefits case to receive benefits (i make too much and did not apply). we have a 3 month old together that lives with us too. we did have a time where paperwork was filed as us being common law married in the past but since then she had put single status on future paperwork. 

anyone know why they would want my status and cut off her benefits? could it be the child? the common law statement? or even living together?

called the hotline and they stated that it was because i live in the same household as someone receiving benefits and would not say anything else (even had to get my tenant on the phone cause they would not talk to me even though they want info about me).

google searches for any info. after the phone call just points to food stamp/medicaid lawyers."
"how to get proof of job loss? i quit my job at then end of september because of the work environment and mental health issues (currently living with parents). i've recently just signed for snap program as i never really thought about getting food stamps. i've been going to food banks for the past few months instead. i don't have a document with my former employer’s name and signature/last day i worked/date and amount of my final paycheck. could i send a w2 and information (company site shows last day worked/termination but not in document form). a little confused on what is acceptable.

edit: state, mn"
"got a letter of discontinuance starting eom. can i still use the benefits till then??? orange county, ca so i no longer qualify for ebt and i received the letter of discontinuance in the middle of this month stating that as of 9/30/23 we are no longer going to receive benefits for cal fresh because we earn above the threshold for our family. i spoke to a case worker when i updated our income and she said technically, you shouldn’t use ebt card balance once you no longer qualify, but some case workers won’t penalize you for it. pretty much saying it depends on the case worker if they want to request the money back. but i have about $330 worth left on the card. am i really still not supposed to use the balance up at all?"
"foods being rejected since jan 1st? so i guess there’s some changes in food that’s covered by ebt since the beginning of the year, maybe i missed some news but i’m wondering what have you ran into with whatever these changes are?

i have found that very, very few herbal teas that are still covered. and although i could see the overreaching to the ones with some sort of medicinal relation (not that i think that’s reasonable), it’s almost none. i know that some of the items that combined food and household goods or holiday food products are not being covered, pez candy & dispensers for one example i ran into, and i have heard that some various food items, like a specific kind of pepper are (don’t remember the kind)."
"never received ebt card my girl filled out an application for ebt in maryland, she did the interview and a couple days later we got a letter in the mail saying shes approved and they would be shipping a card. this card was never received. and now we dont know how to contact someone to reorder it. all the numbers they say to call require a pin to the card which she doesnt have because she doesn’t have the card. what should we do?"
"calfresh notice of approval form hi! applied my parents to calfresh and they got an approval!
i do have a question. 

in the housing expenses, would that their rent cost every month?
and for the utility expenses, would that be again, their utilities cost every month?

their rent is $1050 a month but in the approval form its showing closer to $500. their utility expenses in the form is also $400+ which is close but thats only if you count the phone bill as well(258 for 5 lines). should i call their case worker or are these numbers something else?

nevada : benefit status says ineligible and recertification date says n/a. am i still able to apply and get food stamps? i’ve been getting food stamps since january and i just went in to the website to apply again and sat under the food stamps tab it said terminated on the day i was approved for them? and as said in the title under eligibility status and benefit status it says ineligible am i still able to apply again and receive food stamps?
"protein powder on ebt recently got approved for snap, and haven’t even received the card yet, so i’m super unfamiliar with the whole thing but have been doing research last night and today.  i drink protein powder shakes at least once a day, and a lot of if not most protein powder is labeled as a supplement, so i’m wondering if anybody knows of any that’s got a nutrition label / could be purchased with snap, and what the best quality ones that can be purchased with snap would be?
(indiana if that makes a difference)"
"can i claim my partner as part of the household when applying? i moved recently and transferred within my job. they're cutting my hours to 20/week at this new place. i think i should be able to apply for snap here in colorado, but i'm not sure if i would put down my partner as part of my household even though i pay for/share most of the food. i only ask because they're claimed as a tax dependent by their mom even though we live in our own apartment. thanks in advance!"
calfresh and one time lump sum from crypto does anyone know how it works if you're eligible and on calfresh but you receive a large sum of money from an airdrop? do i report it by calling the moment i receive it at its given price or at the sell point if i exchange it further down the line? thank you.
"approved for calfresh for months, never got any money in my account - account still approved hello i’m not sure if anyone has experienced this.   so i have been approved for calfresh for many months, i’ve gotten an approval letter and my account is active on the website, but, i have not recieved any money.  i check the balance online and on the phone but it has been at .44c for about half a year.  i have called many times and everyone just bs’s me about it being approved but there being some issue and then they forward the case to supervisor, rinse and repeat.  it seems like every person i speak to is omitting something from me, and they pretend they dont know what is going on.

i just gave up on it.. i had been calling every week for about 2 months and everyone kept saying i was approved but nothing ever showed up on my card.  i have been struggling so much with food insecurity, my new job barely covers rent and gas, but other than that i live off of donating my plasma.

i randomly decided to login into my benefitscal website today to re-apply and give it another shot.

turns out i had a message saying  they were gonna discontinue my benefits if i dont start using them soon… the problem is i check my balance frequently in hopes that it shows up, but there has never been a single deposit, even though my account is currently approved and i the green.

i dont know what to do, i’m wondering if someone up there is committing fraud and stealing my benefits??  everyone ive spoken to just reassures me that the money will deposit, but it never does and then i call again and they forward some emails to some supervisor etc, and the process begins again.


any advice?  thank you so much"

"decrease in work hours (college student) i am a college student who qualified because for the past year or so, i've been working at least 20 hours a week. in a couple weeks, i'm moving apartments which has caused changes in my school/commuting schedule which means i won't be able to be at work as often anymore. my ebt card came with a letter that stated that as an able bodied adult without dependents, i should report if my working hours drop to less than 20 per week, but i also found a [statewide waiver for this requirement](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/abawd) online (i live in california). 

i'm assuming that it's okay if i don't report it since its waived until 2024 and after the semester ends, i'll be able to pick up more hours anyway, but because of the conflicting letter (which i think just gets sent with the card automatically with federal requirements not accounting for the states responses to the pandemic), i just want to make sure i wouldn't get in trouble or get charged with fraud."

"nj - applied 6/28/23 no follow up hi, i applied for snap in essex county online on 6/28. i haven’t received any follow-up via mail or phone- have called and filled out a help form with we care multiple times & went to the county office in person and was basically told to let it go until they contact me, but it’s been 3 months now and i’m concerned. i can’t get ahold of anyone when i called the welfare office here either. has anyone else in nj applied around the same time as me and hasn’t heard back or received anything at all indicating where they’re at in the review/decision process? does anyone have any tips for literally anything i can do to help get my benefits? i know they’re so backed up but i’ve seen some posts in this group from ppl who’ve had some luck getting things moving with their apps and i’m just wondering what i can do? i also saw something about asking for a fair hearing but how would i do that if i only have a confirmation # and no case number and is that even what i’d need to do to help get a decision soon? thank you."

"stolen benefits… any hope? | md replacing stolen stamps i just went to check my balance before checking out and $500 was gone from my account. three transactions from the 15th in a town i don’t even live in. i immediately changed my pin and called to report the fraud. the woman was very nice about canceling my card and said i’m going to transfer you to someone to tell you your next steps… then transfers me to some recording saying they couldn’t find fraud on my card. reallllll nice. 

so i now literally can’t feed myself and my daughter this month. i just want to know if anyone has ever had any luck getting benefits that were stolen back? i have no idea what we’re going to do and i’m scared to death. i’m in maryland.

last month i had $466.38 stolen from me in one day in three transactions after my card info was skimmed at a gas station in baltimore. maryland just launched the website to file to get these stolen funds back. i filled mine out monday and despite being told it would take 10-15 business days, i got $467 overnight last night. i’m shocked at how fast it happened!

"efc for financial aid went up, will this affect calfresh? i qualified for calfresh (san bernardino county) last year as a student with an efc of $0. the worker i spoke with was very curt and argumentative and told me if my efc was too high, i would not qualify. she approved me when i submitted my award letter. 

now is time to recertify and i have had no change in assets, no added expenses, have not been employed. nothing has changed since last year, but my award letter now says my efc is $3200. i don't know why that is and my school gave me a generic response, as did fafsa. 

i'm worried that i won't qualify and i know the worker will probably not be understanding and explain things to me.

"case closed with no explaination hi, so i have a question about how it works when the dta closes your case. my boyfriend has been on snap in ma for years, and this morning he received a text saying that they had closed his case. we have been technically homeless for 2+ years. he is not due for recertification as he just did that a few months ago, and when he called the help line they told him they couldn’t give him any information and he needed to go into the office. our worry comes from the fact that around 18 months ago he was in a bad spot with some bills and made the bad decision to sell his benefits twice. this was obviously wrong and he hasn’t done it again since. is it possible that they found out about this after all this time and closed his case? we found it strange that the case worker wouldn’t elaborate on why his case was closed and would only tell him to go into the office. would it be possible for him to get in trouble or even arrested if he went into the office? he’s super stressed about this and can’t afford to lose his benefits. thank you in advance to anyone with any advice!!"

ny max monthly income does anyone know what the max monthly income for a family of three is for ny in order to qualify for cash assistance + food stamps? our case was closed because our income of $798 was above their max income limit. is this true? because it seems a bit ridiculous that $789 is their income limit for a family of three.

i decided to forego the accommodations in graduate school for now mostly because everything has been so extremely busy and i haven’t had time or energy to file for it. since i also do not receive federal benefits for it, does this “count” as a disability? i know it is debilitating and impacts my life but i also know my personal experience may mean jack to the government if it isn’t recognized by some standard."

"question about approval for food stamps | property taxes and homeowners insurance | texas snap change question | how long for a change to be reviewed? i just applied and was approved for food stamps today. i applied on january 5th and i used check stubs and stuff from december.  they approved me starting february 1 and i'm just wondering why february and not january? i'm in texas.

do property taxes and homeowners insurance count as expenses for snap in texas?

i reported that my son wasn't working on january 17 and on march 2, i reported that my daughter moved back in with me. this morning, i finally called 211 and they transferred me to a case worker who fixed the changes right then and there. the question i have is will i get the backpay for march and april  since i made the change on march 2? and if so, do you know when since she fixed it today she said?

i'm in texas and i reported that my 19 year old daughter moved back in with me. how long for her to be added to my case, i reported it on march 2 and it still just says sent. i also reported that my 17 year old son wasn't working on january 17 and that still just says sent also, are they even looking at changes?"

"does cancelling calfresh also result in involuntary disenrollment from medi-cal? based in california. i remember reading somewhere that if you voluntarily cancelled your calfresh case/benefits you would also be disenrolled from medi-cal? is there any basis for this being true?

i was hoping to disenroll from calfresh because keeping track of my irt and having to report it's constant changes would be more of a hassle than just receiving 23$ monthly. my irt is also quite close to how much i am making so taking an extra shift here and there would already push me above it. but my income is still far below the medi-cal eligibility limits even with those extra shifts. if cancelling calfresh does also cancel my medi-cal, would i simply have to report income changes above my irt and wait for them to boot me off? 

thank you all very much for reading, and thank you to all the snap workers for all that you do and the patience you have.

"sar7 processed but massive reduction in benefits even though the notice says there's no change to our case? ca | didn't get our benefits refreshed after turning in the sar7, again? (ca) | sudden decrease in benefit amount again? los angeles county.

okay so we managed to get our sar7 processed over the phone after a lot of trail and error over the phone. weird thing is we went from 381 for two people down to 187 for two people? which is really strange cuz our irt is the same and he confirmed that over the phone. plus i made less money for the documented month on the sar7 compared to when we applied.

the notice of recertification says we're getting 187 for this month and 253 for next month? this is so confusing, i'm not sure why it's reduced so heavily this month but goes up to a still reduced amount next month?

okay so this happened last time we had benefits, i'm in california and the first time we did the sar7 they claimed they didn't get it even thought i turned it in and sent them the email and screenshots of the website saying i did so.  
they admitted they didn't see it and asked me to fill it out again, did a huge run around with about five to eight different people giving us conflicting information on what and how to fill out everything to get the proper information they needed. actually got into a screaming match over three different people in a row after a two hour hold time telling us different information, we could not get a straight answer. this went on for the whole month, some days we'd be on hold for two hours only to have them hang up on us or transfer us to a closed department. we even went in person and they still turned us away. so we ran out of time and reapplied.

applying went just fine, got benefits on a new card with a new pin no problem. i was late to turning in february's sar7 because i've been having massive technology issues. but i did turn it in on the 21st with all of the correct information that i was told to have unlike last time where i was missing a few things. i even went overboard and provided a written letter with resources showing my self employed income. 

i got a text a few days later i needed to upload documents showing that my disabled living had changed...? which it *hasn't,* i didn't even select that it had on the website forms? so i sent a text back saying that i had nothing that i could upload as there have been 0 changes to medical/disabled living. i hear nothing back and our account still shows that it's active.   
i got a letter with no post date on it at all so i have no idea when it was sent saying they hadn't gotten our sar7 by the 11th so our benefits would be discontinued. our account still shows that it's active so i assumed it was sent before i had turned in my stuff.

well we're supposed to be refreshed today, we've been starving for a few days cuz the only food bank near us is like three miles away and we don't have a car or a money for lyft and walking is out due to me being disabled and my partner being injured, plus the only food bank near us actually requires a five dollar donation that we also don't have. so needless to say we've been excited to be able to eat again.

nothing.   
i'm trying not to be frustrated but this is exactly what happened last time but i made triple sure i had bank statements, proof of my payout days, separate highlight colors for one time gifts and my income, my written statement, screenshots of my self employed page, everything. i know i turned it in late but i read i had until the end of the month to do it and if i waited beyond that, then they would be stopped.

the account still says active but we're always refreshed at midnight. have we been screwed over again?

hello, so last month i made a post asking about why my benefits could've decreased without warning. our base amount used to be 380 without the emergency allotment. we renewed with the sar7, our gross income was the same (1900 a month and rent is 1875) but our benefits dropped all the way to 180 a month.

but this month we got 250 in benefits, our amount on the account still said we'd be getting 180 a month but now it's dropped down to 95 dollars a month with no warning or updates as to why? i would think it's the emergency allotment but that's never actually be on our account as the monthly amount each monthly benefit amount.

what the hell is going on here? nothing's changed in terms of employment, gross income, or medical expenses compared to when we applied and renewed. so why does our benefit amount keep dropping?  


edit: wanted to give an update for this. never really got answer/response when on the phone about this situation and didn't have time to go in person but we got our benefits this month on the 8th and it was 250 which was the amount we got last month and the amount that was stated to be what we'd be getting.  
i'm not sure why it changed to 95 for a while there still."
"[florida] food stamps nightmare, unjust/unfair sanction and denial! i have been fighting for two months to only be denied. it started with a letter that was sent to my old address, i had missed an interview for orientation at the workforce center. first, i am both homeless and disabled have been since my husband died during covid. i received a good cause notice and couldn't get through on the phone for week and a half, so i faxed a letter stating the good cause 9 days before it was due and submitted it online, so they received it. then i submitted a change request to update my address and employment status  a whole part time at 150 a week (before tax) all i have found in 5 month of submitting my resume and applications. 

the site notified me i needed to recertify so i did that too. my account changes to technical verification then i started receiving notices. they wanted employment verification i spent weeks trying to get through on the phone and submitted the form my employer filled out. i just started the job, so at the time i had only one pay stub because i get paid bi-monthly and submitted that. i got through to them 3 times in a month in a half. all the while the reps telling me ""i see you submitted everything on time your account looks fine"" and ""you should be sanctioned i noted your homeless. 

my address also reverted back to my old one during the month, so i submitted another change.

during last month i missed a phone call for the phone interview because i was working. i called back every day for a week and she never returned my calls. the 3rd and last time i got through the rep said she could complete my phone interview. i affirmed the homeless situation and disabilities during the interview and asked it to be noted because of the pending sanction. ""everything looks fine"" she says. i would like to note that all my applications state that i am homeless, as well. the day before i get my deposit they send me a letter denied dec and jan. my original application ended in dec now suddenly it ends in jan. of course, the deposit date has passed so i can forget getting anything this month.

the reason (unbeleavble!):  you are receiving the same type of assistance from another program no household members are eligible for this program you did not complete the work requirements listed below for the food assistance program - first non-compliance. we did not receive proof of earned income necessary to determine eligibilty 

i called again, took all day to get the call back. that agent told me it because i didn't submit proof of income for october. i said that is because i don't have proof it was a $280 cash transfer for contract services. i have no pay stubs or any way to prove it, she tells me to write a letter and sign it and submit it online. that my account needs to be triggered for reevaluation. she tells me i have to call again and submit a request and of course can't get through.

but what she is telling me doesn't coincide with the denial letter. i feel like they are screwing people intentionally! like they must be out of money. i have never had these problems before. 

what did i do wrong? i don't honestly know what to do! i have done everything asked of me. i have been unfairly sanctioned and denied. will the local legislation office help if i contacted them? they got my unemployment fixed fast. please does anyone know who i can contact or what i can do?

also, anyone else being unfairly sanctioned or denied?"

"am i being punked? (ga) | reason why my card hasn't shown up? i'll try to make this short. i was approved for ebt on 12/5/22. my first card was allegedly sent out on 12/6/22. i didn't know i'd been approved so i had no idea i was waiting on a card (lack of communication with my caseworker), and when i realized i never got a card on 1/17/23, i ordered a new one. i've never received that one either. now it's 2/13/23 and still no card. wtf is going on? i've called and made sure they have the right address, i've made sure it wasn't at my local office, and no... my local office doesn't print their own cards. 

i'm outside of atlanta, and when i got ebt in small town pa, i got my card in 2 days. it makes no sense. we're hungry...

i apologize for the formatting, i'm on mobile.

i'm in georgia. i was approved for ebt on dec. 5th and i guess our ebt cards are shipped from texas (weird, but okay) and i never received it. i didn't even know i'd been approved, so i wasn't really expecting a card. apparently they sent me a card on dec. 6th and i never got it so i called and had a replacement sent on jan 18th. they said they'd send it right away and it should show up in 4-7 business days.

here we are, on the 28th and i still have no card. i triple-checked that they had my address right. i'm freaking out and i'm livid. has anyone else experienced this? especially in ga?"
"nj had this on their snap page: if you received a lesser snap benefit amount than you expected for april, we are aware of these reduced payments and are working with the u.s. department of agriculture to resolve this concern.  we expect that the additional benefits will be added to your snap card in the coming days.

i've heard that calling to check has also been hit or miss. i was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing issues just checking balance online or calling in for california or other states. thanks!"

"accused of lying and falsifying documents in phone interview, what can i do? the person who interviewed me yesterday was extremely angry and accused me of not submitting my proof of income, repeatedly accused me of lying and falsifying my documents, mocked me

then **she** **completely fabricated an income for me that she claimed was ""more believable""** than what i submitted

then she denied my benefits based on the income that she made up saying my income was ""too high for this program""

i did submit all the correct documents by fax so i have proof

i did not falsify anything, the documents i submitted were bank and credit card statements, all there, all correct

my income was approximately 900 dollars a month which should qualify me

what can i do?

i'm really hoping that the phone interviews are recorded because i would really like to get someone to listen to what i went through yesterday - this went on for about an hour and it's left me pretty shaken up tbh

"renewal of ebt in oregon i wondered has anyone recently had to renew snap benefits because i did my application online (end of october when it was due) and i submitted my needed documents they asked for as well. i haven't received a letter or anything but should of had a deposit for snap on the 4th of november if it were approved (had nothing). so i thought maybe i should check the online website for my account. i just checked it and next to my snap benefits it says denied but all my submitted documents say pending still... it's confusing as heck. 

does anyone have a similar experience and its just because they're behind in checking/looking at information and applications. i tried looking for an email of some kind to send out an email for now since i can't call yet.

i have even called my local office and left a voice mail and that was like the first week of november and they never called me. 

it's now december and i'm still not hearing anything. 😞 

thanks for any insight!"

i know you can't get housing without your ga being in good standing, however at midnight this morning where i normally get my deposit for ga it never came through.

"question about applying with my partner when we live with his mother. i (26f) live with my partner (28m) in iowa. i pay his mother rent every month to stay in a room in her house that i share with him. between the rent i pay her, my other expenses (car payment, medication, etc) and the low income i make at my full time job, i really need to apply for food stamps and i know by myself i qualify. 

here's the problem though... his mom claims him on her food stamps. i wouldn't care that she did this if he was being fed but she blows the whole card on snacks for herself, and there is never food to eat in the house. i buy my own groceries and my partner basically only eats what i pay for out of pocket and he currently can't work to help pay for it.

what would i have to do to get him on my card when i apply? i already know there's going to be a firestorm when she finds out i'm trying to do this because she's very controlling, so i'm prepared for that. 

i just want to know what i can do in this situation to have enough on my card to feed us both."

"wrongful tax levy incredibly long story short, but due to an administrative error / oversight that was not my fault, california (alameda county) overpaid both my food stamps and cash aid, of about $7,000 in 2014. they came for it in 2016 and said i had to repay.

that county is so mismanaged, i can't even deal. it's been nonstop issues since, i've appealed the case twice. i was put on a payment plan of $50/month.

payments should have stopped at 3 years for calfresh with the county dismissing the rest by law, however that didn't happen and i had to file another appeal for the judge to rule that. the judge did rule that, last april.

i received a letter from the state of california with the hearing decision that alameda county would dismiss the rest of the amount and stop collections.

however, i just found out that this year, now my federal taxes have been intercepted because for some reason the amount was never actually dismissed.

where do i even go from here? who do i need to contact at this point?"

"so they gave me the tag?! | psa: keep your ebt info secret!!! | benefitscal.com california ebt website registration process i noticed today that my tag changed to ""snap policy expert-ca"" not sure how. but hi guys happy to be of service! 😊

hi guys,  i'm an eligibility worker in los angeles.  now this one may sound like a no-brainer to not give away your account information. but i felt compelled to share this since something like this happened yesterday. poor middle-aged woman called in a panic saying that some other lady was trying to help her get an appeal (filing for an appeal is your legal right to do so btw) against dpss because she wasn't getting enough money (she was).  she was in distress and on the verge of tears and didn't know what to do. i assured her that most experienced ews are pretty well trained to recognize who is on a case and who isn't but even then there's no guarantee. she wanted re-assurance that con lady could not access her case. i cannot provide that type of re-assurance. if you give away your info,  there's not a lot we can really do until a crime is committed. so please i beg you! keep your information safe! do not give away your case number,  card number or pin (ews cannot access pin  numbers).  please please please protect your info.  ebt theft is sadly on the rise and there's no telling how people will get info. 

thanks for listening. 😊


the california ebt website was revamped and relaunched at the end of april 2022. since someone asked about this, and i do it at least once a day, i thought i'd share the registration process. this is only for ca! 


your first step is to go to *benefitscal.com*. find the link that says *create new account*. keep in mind this is not the start a new application tab!  the create new account hyperlink should be right underneath the log in button.

set up an email address and password. answer the security questions (keep in mind it only likes one-worded answers. so if you answer 'what's your favorite color?' just write blue not aqua blue).

you'll receive a verification code via email. most of the time it doesn't work (known glitch). if this is the case use the one sent via text message. that works 99.9% of the time.

once you're logged in, find a link that says *link a case*. you can use the last four or your social or your case number. the case number will be case sensitive so make sure all the letters are caps. if there is a zero in your case number can almost guarantee it will but the number 0 and *not* the letter o. it should say ""congrats your case has been linked.""

from there you can explore the site, check your transactions and allotments and complete your paperwork when it's due. it's very useful.

good luck!"

"calfresh - moved into nursing home this if for la county

hello,

my 78 year old mother, receiving calfresh, moved into a nursing home mostly for physical therapy to be able to walk. the idea is to have her stay there temporarily, but there is no telling how long she will stay. if she is able to walk decently enough, she will be out of there. meanwhile, we are wondering

1. do we have to call and inform or are the funds cut off automatically once the system registers that she is in a nursing home?
2. if it's cut off, will the calfresh card with the existing funds stop? logically, the funds should stop coming, but the existing funds should remain, considering they were entitled funds that couldn't be used in time (cash had to be paid for non-ebt food). generally, when a person's income rises above calfresh qualifications, his funds stop but his existing remain.
3. i am still buying her food from the market that the nursing staff is serving her, for the simple reason that she is picky and does not eat their food. the staff reported her eating only 30% portions when she was served for the first few days, and that something needed to be done for her nutrition. i might ask for staff to document this if need be. this is probably an exceptional situation for a social worker to answer."

"debt forgiveness & snap (montana) does anyone know if i'd lose my food stamps if i got ""income"" in the form of forgiven debt? i'd like to apply for total and permanent disability discharge of my student loans (and may actually automatically qualify with the recent changes), but i'm absolutely terrified of losing my benefits.

under tpd discharge it would be a one time ""income"" that would hit (counts as discharged for tax purposes) three years after i was approved. i can probably manage a month without my food stamps if that's the way the rules work, but a whole year would be impossible...

ps/additional details: the amount forgiven would be a little over $18k. i also get $914 a month on ssi, no other income. i live in montana."

so far this year we have had an income of $21k, below what is needed for benefits. we had a nice savings built up and were living off of that, but that is now running out. 

husband just got a job as a 1099 but onboarding told him it will take some time to generate work for him. hopefully my husband makes money soon, with a paycheck as proof, so that we can qualify income wise. we have to wait a few weeks for work to ramp up. he couldn’t work until now due to a work injury but has now recovered. 

my question is regarding work - do all parties have to be actively working before even applying? hopefully i get a job soon.

fighting with useless instacart reps now and getting absolutely nowhere, it's like they don't even have account access. one told me there wasn't an ebt card linked to my account, and i sent back a screenshot showing the last 4 of the card under the payment settings.

"mi benefit deposit | card time frame | monthly benefit | benefits | site under construction so we got approved for 89 a month. we got a deposit on the 28th for july after approval then another on the 13 for september. then i saw that the amount would increase for everyone in october by 3.5%. then on the 28th of september i received 120 deposit. is this a mistake? some of this stuff is so confusing and unclear and getting a hold of someone is difficult. we could really use the extra, but i don’t want to get in trouble later down the line for their mistake if it even is a mistake. i’ve heard horror stories. can someone explain this to me?

ok so we just got our letter today that says we are approved in mi. but there wasn’t a card delivered. of course when i call all i get is automated and no real people to ask them about it. now what do i do?

so my family monthly benefit is 89, there are 5 of us. does that seem right?

in mi it says that they have to approve or deny benefits within 29 days of an application. is it common to have to wait the full 29 days for the determination? what’s the likelihood i would be denied benefits and they would wait the whole 29 days to inform me?

"[california] concerned about what i should do, if anything, over my “rescheduled” grow appointment and/or having a negative impact on my gr. los angeles   
so, just to give a heads up i don’t feel like the customer service workers over the phone are reliable with the information they give out when seeking assistance. i give a little mention as to why ahead in the text. and that’s my main concern for how to move forward.   
    
    
   
hey, perhaps you can assist me with a concern i’m having.  
i was scheduled for my first grow appointment, i guess it’s to make an assessment of how my participation in the program is to move forward.  
that appointment was scheduled for over the phone at 3:30pm 03/20/2023.  
  
i awaited for the call, and it didn’t come. i got worried that maybe it was me that was supposed to call so i called the number on the letter i received with the case worker assigned to my case and it would go straight to voicemail (not even a ring).  
i continued to wait for hours and nothing came through. eventually, i just called their customer service line to speak with someone the next day and advise them that i didn’t get a call, that i tried calling the case worker and couldn’t get anything but a voicemail and that i left a voicemail with my name and case number and a number to reach me at.    
they informed me that supposedly my appointment was rescheduled for a later date and that i would receive a letter about it in the mail with details of the rescheduled appointment.  
  
but 9 days have passed since then i haven’t received anything. i don’t feel confident in the reliability of these county workers because days before  my appointment i received calls reminding me of the upcoming   appointment but they got either the incorrect date (the day before the letter states) or the time wrong. i’m not sure what to do next about it, if anything at all but i’m concerned that i could have my benefits revoked for not having that meeting now or doing nothing about it based on the misinformation the customer service worker gave me. i asked her over the phone to what date it was rescheduled to and all she told me that the information would be stated in the letter i was to receive."

"(ca) discontinued benefits (probably due to not reporting address change? ) i cannot get ahold of anyone with the county. should i just reapply so they will call me? i’m in sacramento county

i’m fully owning up to that i have a six month old baby and we just moved a month and a half ago i totally forgot to report the address change.  

i just checked my benefitscalwin and it said it was discontinued. i’ve tried calling the county for two days and i get hung up on every single time. the only thing i can think of is just reapplying and writing in the notes that i hope someone can call me to resolve this?

do you have any other solutions or experience with this? thank you!"
"approved for snap 3 months ago and still no benefits released i missed my recert since it was due while i was giving birth. i was high risk and in and out of hospitals for weeks leading up to the birth. i thought i had more time since i had only been on the program for 6 months and i never got a notice recertification was due. i added my daughter and now my husband because he lost his job a few days after my daughter was born and i my application was approved in june. i haven’t received a penny and my snap and husbands medicaid account has been in “processing” ever since. i’ve called dcf fl 6 times over the last 3 weeks and they say i did everything right and it’s an error on their part and i just need to have a button pushed to activate the account or another story says there is simply a backlog that is taking 2-3 months to receive benefits. they leave a message for the processing department and tell me to call in 3 days and promise it will be done before then and i will get a prorated amount for all the months i have missed out on. has this happened to anyone before? my family is drowning and i just want to afford food, nice warm healthy food."
question about donating blood. hey im in tx if i start donating blood for money do i need to report that on my food stamp case? will the amount decrease? honestly want to know what everyones opinion is.
"food stamp help needed? resident of ca but i  go to college full time in az.  az told me to apply in ca.  i work 20-22 ( i make $20 per hour) hours per week in arizona.  i do not qualify for financial aid because my parents make too much money.  however, i have to pay my rent (on campus apt) and food.  my parents only pay for tuition. i am 19, not sure if that matters.  will i qualify for snap benefits?"
"tx - benefit authorized but not available 9/15 i was authorized for my new amount, reflecting my newest child being added to the benefits
9/24 my usualy benefit day came and i still received my previous benefit amount, which is a signifigant drop from what i was excepting and hoping for

i've called, they don't know why it wasn't the new amount, but promise my next cycle will reflect the new amount, but no clue why the benefits aren't all there. 

anyone else have this issue? did they give you the benefits you were missing for that month or no?"
snap benefits scammed i live in california and the day after my benefits loaded i checked & my card had been used in florida for 400. i called to do a claim & they said it’s happening a lot but they don’t know how. 25 days supposedly to see if i can get them back but it’s been now 30 days & they still can’t give me a status of the claim. they keep saying to wait 5 more days. anything like this happen to anyone else & they actually get their benefits back?
"when to report a new job i will be going back to work in september but likely wont get back on payroll until october. do i report my new job when i start it or when i get paid? honestly, i could use the money and am hoping to get one last october payment before canceling my ebt. i know my salary will make me ineligible even though i have so much past due bills, its likely to take me months to catch up 😪. also, should i just wait until they cancel it? i haven't heard of people having to payback foodstamps in nyc."
"does texas replace stolen benefits? i was a victim of getting my ebt card skimmed over the weekend. i called, canceled the card and disputed all the transactions. i've heard previously of texas basically saying ""oh well you're shit out of luck"" on the money previously and not replacing the funds. does anyone know if they replace the funds now? they stole a huge amount and left me and my toddler with $100."
how much money are you allowed to have on your ebt card? is it okay to just let the money build up on the card? i'm asking because i'm not going to go grocery shopping for a while. and i just got the money on my ebt card on the 1st of july. i just want to make sure that i'm not doing anything wrong. has anyone just let the money build up on the ebt card?

ny state gives me a number to call for an interview and then it won’t let me get my interview . i was given a notice to call for my interview . i call the number and it takes 30 minutes to get to the right place . it even says i can get an interview now. then it doesn’t work and just hangs up on you . they just made it impossible to get foodstamps . is anyone else having this issue ? it is an issue with the given number . is there a way to resolve it . i need to eat and this is defeating .
"question for eligibility expert/fraud department serious question for anyone who may work in the eligibility or fraud department. i have been on foodstamps/medicaid for a lot of years. single parent, usually work full time, just don't make enough to get by. i have always reported my income in a timely manner, however, i believe i have made a mistake in reporting starting back 18 months ago. i usually work through a temp service. one of the jobs i was placed at from 8/2021 to 6/2022 gave me bonuses. i thought they were included on my paystub with the temp service. i have received bonuses from other jobs with the temp service in the past and they were always shown on my paystubs with the temp service. at the end of the year 2021 i received a 1099 nec showing $1,500. i did not realize what it was, i just took papers to nationwide tax preparer and they did my taxes. i vaguely remember the tax preparer asking me if i had business expenses and told him i did not because i do not have a business. thought nothing of it. fast forward to this year and again i received a 1099 nec for $2,400 from the same company. i went to a different nationwide tax preparer and did my taxes. this time the tax preparer explained to me that it was basically a self employment form and that  income was not included on my w-2 from the temp service. so now i realize it was not included on my prior pay stubs that i turned in to job and family services either. so i have 2 years of self employment not reported to job and family services for my food stamps and medicaid. it gets worse. in 2021 i applied for pandemic unemployment. i was approved, but never received it.  i had a pending issue i had an appeal on. it took them until last year/2022 to finally pay me. i received 2 lump sum payments. in the early part of the year i received a lump sum for what was considered  backpay when i first applied for umemployment in 2021. in the later part of the year i received an additional lump sum for what were considered current weeks when i applied in 2021. i did not report either lump sum payment from unemployment because i thought job and family services already knew about those payments. snap, medicaid, cash assistance, and unemployment are all part of job and family services. i talked to someone at job and family last week under anonymity and they told me they do not know about the unemployment payments and i would have had to inform them. shock set in. i was not expecting to hear that.  so now in total i have about $14,000 in income i never reported to job and family services. it's not like i make a lot. in 2021 i made $12000 to $14000- thats including the ""self employment"" and last year i made $13,000 to 14,000 including the ""self employment"" then the $10,000+ from lump sum unemployment. i was unemployed part of the year due to an injury and subsequent surgery.  my 19 yo son also worked last year, while i was unemployed/recovering from surgery. he made $7,000. his income was reported. so total household income was around $30,000 to $32,000. we are a family of three as i also have a 17 yo son. i want to correct this with job and family services as i know it was a mistake and should have been reported. i am currently not under any sort of investigation, but i do not feel right about receiving overpayment for snap. 
so i'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this. do i just call and tell my worker? should i speak to a lawyer first because i fear once i report it's going to become a legal issue?  i am worried about getting in trouble or my 19 about to be 20 yo being held accountable for my mistake. i have done some research online and i'm confused as to weather he or my 17 yo will have to share in the cost of snap repayment. i see it says any adult on the case 18 or over is reponsible for overpayment, but also see it says anyone under 22 is excluded/not counted as an adult if they lived with a parent. obviously my kids are not filling out paperwork or signing forms i am. i know i will have to pay back all snap overpayment and probably be disqualified meaning we won't get food stamps any longer.  i am mostly concerned about being over eligibility for medicaid or charged with fraud for snap or medicaid. i can't imagine how much it would cost to pay  back medicaid with all the procedures, surgery, physical therapy, etc i have had. if i have to pay the rest of my life i guess i will, but i do not want my children to have to pay for my mistakes. that's not a good way to start their young lives. can anyone help with this? i need advice. anyone have a similar situation? all the info i see online for people being charged with medicaid fraud only talks about doctors, hospitals, or people charging for services getting in trouble. not someone in my situation. please do not make me feel any worse than i already do. i have not been able to sleep since friday when i did my taxes and realized my error."

"moving in 3 wks. (nj to nebraska) | moving to nebraska (nj). i'm moving to nebraska on june 2nd. my mom is appealing my ebt denial letter - which is a problem.
i need to apply for ebt when i get to nebraska - so how can i make sure my mom doesn't recertify me after i move? (she's abusive and i'm cutting off contact with her after i move, so that's another factor in all this)

i'm also switching my social security, possibly switching my life and health insurance (i can't afford it right now), doing a change of address with usps, and the whole 9 yards.

but what is the best way to recertify myself for ebt in nebraska after i move?

i'm moving to nebraska in may 2023. do i need to get recertified after i move? if so, what would the process be?"
"can’t set up pin p-ebt received a p-ebt card (california) in the mail, yesterday. tried to set up the pin this morning. got all the way through the process up to entering the pin a second time to confirm, then it said “your account cannot be accessed at this time. goodbye” and it ended the call.

i tried this twice before calling customer service. the rep said that they cannot set up the pin over the phone, it’s possible the system is just down, but if i try three times and it doesn’t work i will be locked out of my account. 

so… i have no way of knowing if the system is indeed down and when it will be back up. now i’m worried i’m gonna lock myself out of my card :/

is anyone else having problems with the most recent p-ebt cards? never had this issue before"

 even says there's no deposit date scheduled either! could someone clarify if this means they're still looking it over, and i should actually call them or just wait and see until midnight before calling anything? i'm not the card holder, i'm asking for my dad who is the card holder!

update!:no deposit, was expected. we'll try calling them about it tomorrow before their official hours close since we cant travel to the office at the moment.

update #2: we actually got called for the interview today, they admitted they barely just started to process the application and that's what the phone call was for. good news is that we're being processed and being approved. hooray! i'm sorry for those who are delayed at the moment, really. i hope that resolves soon!!!"

"accidental duplicate public assistance state 1 = alabama.

state 2 = florida.

i moved from state 1 to state 2.

in state 1, i got food stamps. when i arrived in state 2, i applied for food stamps and within 2 weeks, i reached out to state 1 to cancel my food stamps after moving. i did this because i wanted to make sure we were going to be moving as the move was very hectic and iffy.

during this hectic time, to my surprise, i got duplicate assistance for 1 month. i didn't realize i got the duplicate assistance because i wasn't checking my other ebt card. i just spent the money on my 2 kids and me.

that was in september of 2019. since i've been getting ""paris contact"" letters every 3 months, (these are letters saying i got assistance in 2 states at once and i need to prove my 2 kids and i live in state 2 only). i've been getting these for 1 1/2 year every 3 months and send proof we live here.

since it's summer time now, my kids school can no longer provide me proof of residency and i'm tired of proving something countless times. i call state dcf 2 and they tell me to inquire with state 1. well state 1 tells me that i did have duplicate assistance for the month of september and they are sending in a claim on that today since they haven't done it.

"can i work a short-term job without losing my calfresh and medi-cal (medicaid) coverage? hey everyone,  
i wanted to share my situation and seek some advice. for nearly a year, i haven't been able to work due to various reasons. currently, i'm living in los angeles and relying on medi-cal for my healthcare coverage and calfresh. as i'm in the middle of completing some classes, i recently stumbled upon a short-term tutoring job.  
the job is expected to last only around two months, but it's appealing to me because it offers both valuable experience and much-needed income. however, i'm concerned about going over the income threshold set by calfresh and medi-cal, which could result in losing my benefits and health insurance. it doesn't seem worth it to risk losing coverage for such a short-term gig, and buying private health insurance without benefits wouldn't make much sense either.  
i'd appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have in this situation. is there a way for me to work this short-term job without compromising their benefits? 

is it possible to just pause it for those months? 

i'm hoping to find a solution that allows me to pursue the job while maintaining the necessary healthcare support.  
thanks in advance for your help!"

"do food stamps work in different states? here’s the story,

my 80-year-old grandmother in pennsylvania gets food stamps. not much money like $80 bucks a month. 

she is having health issues and will be splitting time living between pennsylvania, north carolina & florida. we are hoping her primary residence will be with me in north carolina.

my household ( family of 3) has an income around $115,000 . obviously we make way too much to be on food stamps.

so what happens to her food stamps? are we still able to use them to help buy her groceries? can she only use them in pennsylvania?
will she lose them because of our salary?

"not sure if i reported wrong | reporting income that's over the irt | stolen funds claim being denied hello all. this is for calfresh (california food stamps) and i reported the changes online on benefitscal. however, when i reported, they asked for when the effective date was, and because of the info they gave on what effective date is (when you start a job), that's the date i put in for it. 

however, i only received the income like at the very end of that month, rather than the start of it. which means, if i put in the date of the effective date being the start of it (february), it's already been way over 10 days. but the date i actually received it was the very last day of february, which has only been about 8 days since and i decided to report before the 10 days. should the effective date i put in be the date i received the income?

was wondering if there would be a problem. i would try calling, but again, the lines are always so busy and a hassle to deal with. i'm unable to edit the change that i've submitted.

hey all. i was just wondering how exactly would i proceed with now having an income that went over the irt of the month. i just got the pay today, and i'm assuming since it's the end of the month, the amount wouldn't carry over to the next month right? sorry if it's a stupid question. reason why i'm wondering is because the pay is not consistent and comes from doing independent contractor work. i know i have 10 days to report it.

also, i'd have to report every time my income for the month goes over the irt right? so what if i report it within a few days of it going over the irt. i'd still have to continue to report it towards the end of the month too as it goes up right?

just making sure i'm getting it right. thanks!

edit: california btw

hello all. i've had some of my funds stolen some time about 3/4 weeks ago. i was dealing with the ebt customer support of my state to try to figure it out.

the first time i made a call to report all the transactions (like the day of when i saw fradulent activity) that i know for a fact i did not make ended up with the person only helping me write a claim for one transaction, and it wasn't even the transaction i had a problem with.

i called again after realizing they didn't help with my problem, and this time they actually wrote a claim for the 5 transactions i had an issue with. these 5 transactions totaled up more than a months worth of benefits.

now i got the letter back today saying that all of them are denied.

what gives. i really didn't spend any on any of these transactions that were made in a county that i hardly ever go to.

now i'm not even sure if i'll even be able to get any of it back.

los angeles, ca btw. but the fraudulent transactions were from another county."
visiting someone in a different state with calfresh so i am going to another state to visit my boyfriend for a few months. am i allowed to use it there or would 3 or 4 months be too long out of state of california? i have lived in california all my life and i only recently got cal fresh food stamps a couple months ago but i wanted to visit someone in new york state and i plan to come back here to california always. should i call them and tell them to inform them i’ll be away? i’m not staying there in new york permanently. i’m coming back here after. i am in ventura county.
"what does this mean? im in texas
so i renewed my food stamps online last year like in june and in december it said that it needed to be renewed by the 31 to get in 2023, and i did sent the renewal application online the 31 
i just got a letter today saying that im not elegible anymore, can an expert tell me what this means? i tried googling it but it’s confusing, thank you.

you are not elegible for benefits- (tw a-2350, 1 tac 372.1001, 7 cfr 273.10) 
you failed to return the recertification packet by the due date-(tw a-2324, 1 tac 372.1001, 7 cfr 273.14)"

"to my fellow eligibility workers. remember to care for yourselves so we can care for others. burnout and compassion fatigue is very real in our line of work no matter how resilient you may be. | check in with fellow elig workers. how y'all doing? | how to handle the covid-19 outbreak as an eligibility specialist? checking in with fellow eligibility workers. i hope you are all coping with ""return to normal"" which from my end seems to be anything but. 

a little about me: covid waivers and unemployment extensions ended in my state last month and it's been chaos ever since. my county and more specifically my department (family snap/tanf) has been hit with more applications than we know what to do with. then renewals started... i've never seen us this behind on processing in my entire 10 years at the county. my task this week was answering phone calls and after 50 calls tallied yesterday i broke down and cried. we finally had overtime approved by management today so i could cope knowing there's a light at the end of the tunnel. 

take care and be kind to yourself and each other. take advantage of employee assistance program (eap) if you have it.

are you taking care of yourself first so you can be sane enough to help others? 


i know it's beyond stressful what we are doing. many of us are overwhelmed by the sheer number of applications.


my mind can't seem to stop racing sometimes. i'm worrying about the families  that i serve and my own family that i'm ignoring. 


its almost like this is our rocky moment. like if ever there was a desperate need for someone with our esoteric skills, it's now i suppose. 

this is a wild time for sure but we are luckier than most. i think we will look back on this someday and be proud of what we did. that's what keeps me going. 

thanks for listening to my totally sober friday night ramblings. everyone stay safe and sane!

hey fellow eligibility specialists! i'm a family worker in mn and we are just starting to see the spread of covid-19 across the state. our specific county doesn't have any confirmed cases but is just a matter of time. my unit has a high level of client contact including in-person interviews for cash assistance, clients dropping off paperwork, and walk-in clients with questions. to be honest i'm just waiting for this to take down our entire staff. i'm not overly panicked about this but i feel like i have a very good chance of being exposed and exposing others to the virus in my line of work and i'd like to mitigate this as much as possible. 

how are you guys handling this? has their been any changes to your process regarding client contact? have your agencies waived otherwise mandatory in person interviews (think tanf applications).? has your agency talked to you about precautions and have they provided you things like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes? have they offered the option to work from home?"
"vehicle/asset (ks) | noa notice of discontinuance (ks) | renewal online issues (ks) i’m asking for my not tech savvy friend. if somebody is on food assistance and has a vehicle but the co-signer(her dad) is the primary due to credit and such, if the person refinances the loan to put it solely in their name would they lose their food assistance? i hope that makes sense. i’ve heard people say that could make you lose it but i’ve also heard it shouldn’t make a difference

thank you

i got a message on my online account that shows they’re sending a letter saying they’re discontinuing our food assistance because i failed to do an interview. how do i go about getting this fixed for may?? i emailed them pictures of the signed forms and proof of income etc. this happened one other time and i was able to get it fixed but i don’t recall who i got ahold of or how. i received the mail notice of the need to renew it three days after it said it was due though. and it says online it had to be completed by 4/30 and they’re cutting it off when that date hasn’t even arrived yet? i have twin 1.5 year olds and an almost 9 year old that truly depend on it. my anxiety is literally through the roof about this. my boyfriend is the only one working and it’s just walmart so it honestly doesn’t go very far in the expensive college town we live in and he has one debit card, his grandpa passed away last night so he’s going to be going to his funeral but it’s in texas so i’m going to be alone with the kids multiple days for the first time and won’t be able to get groceries. any and all help is greatly appreciated in advance. thank you

has anyone had a lot of issues submitting their renewal application online? when i get to the end it will say oops we are not able to retrieve the necessary data at this time try to resubmit the change at a later time or i’d get an issue with a null scenario when i got to the optional release page. i had called the help desk and they said make a new login and link my case so i did, just went through it and it’s doing the necessary data issue :( it says it’s due by 4/30 but the paper one had a different date which had passed before i received it in the mail. my boyfriends the only one working, we have an 8 yr old and i stay home with our twin 1 year olds so understandably i have soo much anxiety around getting this resolved to receive in may. does anyone have any advice or exp with this?"
"how much is normal? i'm 66 and never drew any unemployment or really and kind of assistance and it's taking forever to get my ssi going. friend said sign up for food stamps. kinda ashamed but would sure help. so i finally broke down, applied and qualified. they sent me a card immediately with a letter saying i get $290 a month. i barely spend $90 every 2 weeks and when i checked the card balance it was $583!!! i called and they said i was backpay from the day i applied. crap, i guess i can start eating a little higher on the hog now."
"snap recert delays nj | snap for students nj | ebt snap benefits late - nj | sold car nj snap question | adh waiver | reporting new job nj | refund from tax returns - nj | closed case - nj submitted all my forms back in january through the mail. apparently they never ended up at the right office.  i thought they might be running behind, so i called up the office.  they didn’t have my paperwork, so i did phone interview. this was in february.  it has been about 20 days now, still no benefits.  im wondering if they will drop my case after a month?  i keep calling and every time it’s the same “we are running behind”.

so i have one dependent under 7 and am a full time student over 24 and am not working.  back when i originally applied for snap, i did not have to submit financial aid documents.  and my last interview, i was asked to submit documents.  i am getting federal loans/pell grant to cover some expenses, but not food.  however, my salary was above 40k in 2021 and my efc was estimated to be 605.  i am not actually receiving monetary help from any family.   does my efc have to be zero for me to receive snap??  i am trying to get my financial aid office to process change income forms as well, which might bring my efc down.

hello!  i submitted all my snap documentation for recertification and no word back.  i had my paperwork out in the mail around jan 5th and the deadline to submit my application was jan 15th.  i usually have my card reloaded by the 2nd of the month.  i am not sure what is going on.  anyone know how i can get an update on my case?  thank you!

i sold my car a few months ago, called the social services shortly after and they said i didn’t need to report it.  the sale did not exceed the yearly snap income guidelines, but definitely the monthly limit for family of 2.  now i have to re-certify.  there is a section yes/no if i sold anything of substantial value.  does anyone know if i should i report this on the form??

long story short i spoke to an investigator about fraud refferal on my account.  they are trying to say that my child’s father lived with me at my address.  there were some mistakes on my application that i made bc i didn’t know how to report them.  i was a full time student and had been getting money from college from my parent’s tap fund (this all went directly to tuition). i also took out a small federal loan and got a pell grant, again going towards tuition.  i thought i should apply for snap and mediciad based on the fact that i was not married and he was not giving us access to any of his income. he however did help us out with rental and utility payments which, i never got the money. this money went directly to landlord. i know i should have reported that help, but i was under the impression that they were looking for verification that i live there. i didn’t know that money snap funds were increased based on living costs, so they gave me the full amount every month.  i called someone on the phone for medicaid, and they said as long as you file taxes seperately for yourself and child and not married it’s ok to get medicaid for yourself at least.  the investigator told me this was fraud..  im not sure how as the gov website says only to include married partners. unfortunately he didn’t update his mailing address when i applied they generated the reports that are their primary evidence.  my case is now closed due to the fact that i started a job and make too much.  fast forward i get a letter to waive my right to a fair hearing.  im trying to figure out what the best situation is? im willing to pay them back anything that is over issued but preferably not the whole amount.  i would think taking it to a fair hearing and disqualification hearing would help me give them an explanation of what happened.

so when do i have to report a new job for snap? i was under the impression that it would be after my first month of paychecks.   or is it after i receive my first paycheck?  i believe this job will make me ineligible if my total monthly income is looked at.

am i required to report tax return refunds over a certain dollar amount? what about refunds from a tuition assistance account? (not in my name).

so i was recently asked to provide more information after my initial interview.  i received my benefits for this month. however they want the information by beginning of next week or they will close my case.  my letter arrived only yesterday.  i don’t know if i will have time to give them info.  what happens if they do close my case?  will i be allowed to use my current benefits until then?  will my case be subject to further investigation?  im currently working out paying the remainder of rent due, and my landlord is fairly generous.  i am a full time student and currently don’t work during the school semester but i get federal loans for housing.  i guess i am wondering, should i show them my bank statements which don’t show the whole story or do i wait and reapply again?"

"calfresh address change | tanf-funded cal grant a/b hello, 

 i was wondering if it would be suspicious if i submitted an address change the day after i got recertified for calfresh (this is due to me moving to college and i submitted my recertification a while back)?

is there also a way i could view the address change on my calfresh information on the benefitscal site just to see if it really updated in the system or not? if not, would this mean i would have to call them and make sure it changed?

thanks all.

"kentucky snap application/procedures | snap denial for a little back story here, i have never had snap benefits & first applied in october, to be denied two months later. when i called to see why i was denied, i was told i had uploaded the wrong documentation for proof of self-employment, even though i had uploaded exactly what the woman in my interview told me to. they made me reapply and told me the correct thing to upload, which i did. after waiting another month, i received a denial notice again in the online portal today, stating all required documents were not uploaded. so i called them and the first person i spoke to went through every requested document and stated they were all there and that she was going to transfer me to a case worker. after being on the phone for a total of two hours i was told that, while i did get a denial notice, my application was not denied and was still processing, and that, once again, they did have all required documents. this is all the case worker i spoke to could tell me and could do nothing else for me. she stated that as soon as my case is approved, i would have a card sent to me. after this two hour call, i called back to use the self-service option to check on my case and the automatic system stated there were ""no active or pending cases"" after i entered my information.

my question here is, how can a case still be pending after receiving a denial notice and the automatic system stating there are no active or pending cases? can new cases not be approved over the phone, because everyone i have spoken to has stated there is nothing they can do and all i can do is wait to be approved. i have been trying to get approved for benefits for 3 months now, and even though i did not send the correct thing the first time i applied, it was not my fault that the woman i spoke to did not tell me the correct thing to upload. i went through the entire process of applying and uploading documents again, it has been over 30 days, and i am told my application is still pending, even though the online portal states that i was denied. according to the case worker i spoke to, literally all i can do is keep waiting until i miraculously receive an approval for a denied application? is it just me, or are the correct procedures not being followed for assisting individuals here in kentucky? any help or information would be greatly appreciated!

so, i applied for snap benefits in kentucky 2 months ago. submitted all of my documents requested within less than a week. i just received a notice of denial yesterday stating that my application was denied due to not submitting documents for everyone who lives in the household and employment income, even though those documents were submitted and are shown as accepted in my account. 

i am not sure what could be the issue here if the documents have been accepted. i submitted a hearing, but it stated it could be up to 60 days before i hear anything about the hearing. we are a family of 5 & i am a stay at home mom of 2 boys, one with cerebral palsy. my husband has a low paying job and we have been struggling to make ends meet. should i just call them first thing monday? i am assuming that would be the quicker option. i just cannot believe how hard it has been to get benefits here. waited two months to be denied for not submitting documents that are clearly shown as accepted documents i submitted in their online portal."

"pennsylvania - elderly parents both on ssi but are they above the income threshold? lots of conflicting information. my parents are both in their 70's, retired, receiving $2700 of ssi ""unearned income"". so they're technically over the snap income threshold but it's ssi not earned income so they'd be bbce (broad based categorically eligible) for at least the minimum snap benefits of $16.  my question is - will their ssi amount affect their snap disbursement? 

do they still have to do the asset test? are their utility, medical expenses considered in this? there's housing repairs they've been putting off because of the fixed income and it all just makes me so nervous for them. 

as bbce's are they eligible for the full snap amount because ssi isn't gross income so their income is just '0'? if so, 1) great and 2) would save me some paperwork gathering as i try to put this app together for them.

hi i’ve previously had ebt in the past when i worked a job outside of school. i don’t have it anymore because u don’t have a job right now. i qualify for work study and i read that you can get ebt if you participate in work study. is there a minimum number of hours i have to work?

is $23/month normal for a situation like mine?"
"is this allowed? /could i try again? i applied a while ago to california (orange county) calfresh during the pandemic. 
i live w my boyfriend who i’d been dating 2 years at that time. once the lockdown was somewhat ended yet still high alert, i still had few opportunities for shifts at my job, so i couldn’t afford my portion of rent anymore, so he paid it all. even with him paying rent, i could only sort of afford to pay my loans (i would have a forbearance for a couple months every so often on n off) and a few other things like gas, but only if u didn’t factor in food. 

i got the interview to determine eligibility, and told her my situation, and truthfully explained that i only share maybe one meal a week - if that!! - with my partner. to my knowledge it has to be something like half your meals shared or something for them to be part of the household income they determine?  she said that even the one meal meant he needed to be included and to send that info in to be eligible. 

problem is, while he certainly was struggling a bit himself during that time, he made well above the limit for both 1 or 2 people because the limits are so low, never mind with me added on. either way, to my knowledge she seems to have just, decided i was lying or something because those weren’t the rules i was aware of. and i didn’t find any info on challenging it or something..

is there anything i could have done/ can do? 

since that time, my bf is actually doing decently well financially, and i’m better but not “anywhere near the limit” better (long story short i don’t anticipate being close anytime soon, for disability reasons, but for a large number of reasons i’m pretty sure i would not qualify for any disability benefits..)

anyway my income would qualify if there was a way for him to not be roped into it. it seems like it’s “on my file” on my online ca benefits account (i do get medical and it shows all benefit activity), that he is apparently “in my household” (even though that’s not the case for literally anything else like taxes or anything). i don’t know if they’d listen since i still live with him?"
"calfresh - purchase vs balance. which one do i use? i was just at grocery outlet and tried to use my ebt card but was ultimately unable to buy it with my ebt card. the transaction went normally as well too. i slid my card so it could be read, it was recognized, asked me what kind of card, i chose ebt>food>purchase or balance. however when i got to the purchase or balance screen, i tried both and neither worked. i'm not quite sure if its something i'm pressing or just generally unaccepted there at the store or a mistake on the end of the cashier. it wasn't the first time i had problems with this specific grocery outlet too. i know that when i do ebt>food>purchase at 99 ranch it works with no problems. i'm just confused as to why it differs so much from store to store and what the general rule of thumb is when you use the card and want the transaction approved. any clarification is appreciated!"
"if i move into college dorms and start working will my family lose their snap benefits? i’m 18 and starting college fairly soon. when i was 16, i started a minimum wage hostess job and worked very minimal hours. during that time, i guess my wage overqualified us for snap benefits (tx) and even though i only worked for a month, we weren’t able to earn our stamps until a year later.

now i’m debating leaving for the dorms, since i wanted to apply to a student job to pay almost $3000 left of my tuition, but i don’t want to risk my family’s food stamps. since i’m 18, and technically moving out, would the same happen? or would my family be completely fine? i saw in snap article that as long as you visit home once a month, you’re technically still included in that household, which i was planning on doing."
"second phone hearing with judge | no liheap payment? i live in michigan on ssi disability and mdhhs handles this here that’s why i am asking in this forum.

 i had a phone conference hearing with a judge and a representative from mdhhs a week or so ago regarding an epo being removed from my medicaid coverage. the hearing went well in my opinion with the judge ending the hearing stating he will review the case and issue a decision in writing and to expect it in the mail. i got a letter instead with a new hearing date and time, no other paperwork attached. does anyone have any experience with this happening or maybe insight into what this may mean? i’ve presented all of my documentation, short of calling witnesses i have nothing more to show to the judge.

thank you.

i live in michigan and received my first liheap payment last month on the 17th, and a letter stating that i will be getting these payments “on or about the 17th of each month” today is the 19th and no payment. i will add that i saw that i had $20.01 as a cash benefit that i had not had before heading into the grocery store and used the cash to pay for laundry detergent and a bag of dog food leaving just over $2 left on the cash side of benefits. same day after the mailman comes i get the letter explaining the liheap payment and that it has to be used for my utilities bill, oops i guess? so this month no payment, i used my debit card last month to pay some utilities and plan on doing the same tomorrow, so my question is. do i need to pay the utilities with my debit card to get the liheap payment? did i screw my self by getting laundry soap and dog food? or is there something i’m missing? any help would be great! thank you. if it helps i am 100% disabled receiving ssi benefits."
"pebt card mailed aug first, still no sign? in ca here. i called and they said it was mailed aug 1st. confirmed address, it's correct. normal mail doesn't take this long to get here so i'm just wondering if anyone else experienced a long wait time for the pebt 4.0 in the mail. my sister already recieved hers about a week ago.
also to note the pebt dept said they won't replace the card until 30 days after the mailing date. why would it take 30 days to get here in the mail?

"emergency allotment texas hey guys, i’m trying to figure out if i’m going to receive my february emergency food stamps. i usually receive it on the 5th and as of now, i haven’t gotten it. something strange did happen in december though. i received $138 on the 29th randomly. i assumed it was my emergency allotment for january, however, i received my regular $95 on the 5th as usual along with my standard food stamps on the 16th. now i’m wondering if the $148 was an early emergency allotment and if so, why was it $148 and not $95 and also why 2 months early? i’m all turned around. any helpful feedback would be much appreciated! thanks!"
"why is my county so dumb?! so i just had a baby (july 25), a few days after i got home i received a letter from my local jfs stating that they got notice of my babies birth and he's been added to my family. well in that same day, i got another letter from them saying they're cutting my food stamps down and cutting me completely off of cash assistance as my fiance just got a raise, and apparently he makes 50$ more than the minimum requirement for a family of 6. well with the new baby, it now makes me a family of 7. so i filed for a hearing, i waited like two weeks before i even got a date for my hearing. within that time, my baby was released from the hospital and i was able to finally submit hospital paperwork ect. 

so i had the hearing this passed monday, the jfs rep went first with their statement. i told them my reasoning for the hearing, the officer told me that it had no relevance to the case. then the jfs rep said they have no documentation on sending me any kinda letter or have anything on file of what i sent in.  

i'm just confused on how you lose paperwork that you sent me along with things i sent in and have proof i sent it. and how my reasoning for the hearing has no relevance? like wtf."

"proof of expense | how do i get this fixed? | ca ebt question what can you use as proof of expense of childcare? can i just use an invoice? this is in california.

i’m in california 
so i had my phone interview with cal fresh yesterday i used to have food stamps last year, but i ended up getting a second job which ended up causing me to get discontinued since i had too much income. anyways, i replied in january because i’m down to one job now and my husband is still disabled and unable to work.
the interview went fine. i’m making just a slight bit less than what i used to make when i originally qualified but i noticed in the denial letter that they did not put my dependent care monthly payment therefore i did not qualify and was denied. that was the only thing different from this years application compared to last years. i’ve tried calling my case worker, but it goes straight to voicemail. is there anything else i can do to get this fixed? i remember clearly telling her on the phone that i pay for child care. i’m not sure why she did not put it on there. what can i do at this point?

so my ebt was discontinued because i had 3 different incomes. i am losing 1 of those incomes on december 31st. 
i will definitely need my ebt again once i lose that income and i will qualify again with two incomes. so what should i do? should i report a change now? or later? or just reapply? not sure what direction to go"

"questions about trump’s food stamps in a box idea not sure if you've heard about this but there was a proposal early this year from the trump administration to [significantly change](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/12/food-stamps-trump-administration-343245) the food stamps program. the president himself called it a program like blue apron style food delivery.  as the year draws to a close and members of congress are still negotiating changes to the food stamps program, i am curious about how this new program fits into all that. would like to hear what other people think about this since the press has left that topic alone but i feel like there could be something sneaked out of the lame duck to make these drastic changes the president is requesting. i found [this list of questions](https://foodstampsnow.com/60-questions-about-trumps-food-stamps-harvest-box/) about the program. while some of the questions are over the top, i found the ones below to be important points to addressing if this is where the program is going. thoughts?  
who makes the boxes?  
who decides what goes in the boxes?  
what about fresh fruits and veggies?  
what if you don’t receive your box one month?  
what if you’re homeless?  
what if you don’t have a place to receive mail?  
what if you have allergies?  
is the value of the box the same as the value of the snap?  
what’s the overhead cost?  
do folks receiving government assistance deserve to get to choose their own food?  
does the box change based on family composition?  
will companies be able to lobby to change the contents of the boxes?  
will the government accept free food from companies?

my uncle, on the other hand, had a wife that earned $100k/ a year and three kids, lied on their application telling them that they were single and was forced to pay back what they spent after they got a job.

"rejected and now receiving benefits? hi all, i'm reaching out to reddit to see if anyone has had a similar situation since my counties' office is nearly impossible to reach.

for starters, i am a college student who lives with 3 other roommates. in this apartment building, we technically all own our own room, and the only thing we share is the common room. we are expected to cover all of our own expenses, and the only thing we share money for (occasionally, usually it's me having to buy everything,) is paper towels, trash bags, etc. anyways, i applied for food stamps a few months ago due to struggling to find a job, and not having enough money to live on. the first time around i was rejected for reasons i cannot remember, but i know i didn't agree with them and tried to appeal only to never have my phone call or voicemails answered. i sent in another application a month or two later only to be rejected once again, but this time it said something similar to, ""you have been rejected for the following reasons: \[blank\]."" nothing was written, and i was incredibly upset that i didn't bother to reapply again after that.

now to the present: it has been maybe 2 months since i last applied and i haven't heard anything from my country regarding my food stamps. today i received two letters saying that i've been approved for food stamps from january 2023 to 2024. i am incredibly confused since, as far as i know, i've been rejected. i called the ebt hotline since apparently i've been receiving benefits since january, but never received a card. apparently they've been putting my benefits on my old card (i did my first degree in 2018, and was on food stamps then) and never told me. i will be receiving a card in the next few days, but honestly this entire thing is throwing me for a loop. i'm incredibly grateful i will be receiving benefits, but also really confused why my case suddenly changed. has this happened to anyone else? or for any workers on here, can someone explain why this might be? i'm from minnesota."

"bouncing between eligible and ineligible. is it worth it? (co) our family qualified for snap, medicaid from paystubs from my husbands job in july, it took them months to process and let us know we qualified in november. before we knew this, he found a seasonal job for november and december that pays more in hopes that they’ll keep him on permanently (we’ll know in jan if they’ll keep him). i’m supposed to confirm income in early january to continue benefits….but our income will most likely kick us off benefits since this seasonal job pays more+overtime. if he gets to keep this job, we’ll be set and won’t need assistance, if he doesn’t…we’ll be back at the old job we did qualify for assistance with. im worried we’ll be kicked off due to season income and have to re-apply a few weeks later. i have a 11 month old and can’t take the chance to lose medical coverage for him. can i ask for an extension until we get the news? how would you go about this? tia"
"i find it’s best to plan a food budget while using ebt food benefits | i was expecting my cash assistance to be available sooner, according to the two notices i received i divide the food budget into four parts, and keep it the same every week, so it lasts for the entire month. i have been eating sardines and tunafish, both packed in olive oil, with ramen noodles. lots of protein and omega three fatty acids, so it’s nutritious and satisfies hunger. i can eat this three times per day without going over the budget. i avoid all junk food and sodas, because it drains the energy. and i need that energy to get back financially stable, when i eventually cancel my ebt. i am wondering what everyone else is buying with ebt? i’m in new york and food prices are high here.

the two notices state that the cash assistance will be available after 7/8/23 will they be paid on the ebt pick up schedule by the toe digit or manually entered by a worker?          if it’s done manually, i was expecting it to be paid sooner, as it has been active since july 3. i’m from new york and if it’s done by the ebt pick up schedule, it will take another week."

1. i got noticed on the app that my kids medicaid application was approved but i can’t restart my daughters therapies without the actual medicaid number- is there a place i can go to find that or do i just have to wait for the cards to come in the mail? if so how long does it normally take to mail?

2. my food stamp application still says pending- i sent all the requested information and the medicaid part was already approved. they also mailed me an ebt card but when i activated it they said the balance was zero. why did the mail me a card if i wasn’t approved or haven’t been approved yet?

hi everyone -my food stamp application was denied because of my van. they said they go off the blue book value which is 17,000ish. i owe 24,000ish but they said that didn’t matter because with whatever calculations are done my resources are 6280 and the limit is 5000. if i can get it appraised for lower (a couple dealership quoted me online for 14000-15550) would that make any difference at all? i can’t just let my car get repossessed i need it go to work and take my kids to school. i have 2 kids and make 16.00 an hour if that’s relevant. on my denial letter that’s all that’s listed is my van.

hi if anyone is able to answer i would appreciate it- we are a family of three (1 adult, 2 children) and i make 16.00 an hour/ 40 hours a week. i was denied because it says i have to many resources. all i have is my car. according to the paper i received in the mail today my car resource is 7225 and the max amount is 5000? so does that mean i cannot get any food stamps because of my car? i don’t own it and am still paying it off. thanks for your help!"
"what to do when caseworker is useless? long story short, i had a really amazing caseworker, but she left….and the new caseworker that i have is completely useless. she will not respond to emails. she will not respond to phone calls. i go to the office in person to try to talk to her and she gives me as little information as possible. i have now lost my food stamps because she will not give me the paperwork i need to renew them. i switched jobs since my last renewal, so she was supposed to give me paperwork to give to my current boss to fill out regarding my wages.

i don’t know what to do. i don’t know if it’s possible to request a different caseworker or if i can escalate this up to a state level. because the lady i have completely sucks and i’m struggling to get food."
ebt card hasn't refilled. who do i call? i live in michigan and i recieved my card in august which is the month i stopped working. it hasn't been refilled like it said it would be every month. i just recently found out that i did not update my work status even though i swear i did back in august. is there a real person i can call for help to recieve the months i haven't gotten? every number i call is all automated  and just tells me to visit the michigan.gov/mdhhs website which isn't helpful to my situation
"tasks required for florida ebt is like a job itself this applies to people who are under 50, not disabled with no children 

i was laid off and i’m looking for a new job. i applied for food stamps and was approved for 3 months ($251 month), but i also had to go see a case worker at the careersource  center.  for those who are under 50, not disabled with no children, you are required to do 80 hours a month of tasks of their choosing.

1. you see case worker every 2 weeks in person. you have to apply for 39 (yes 39) jobs every 2 weeks, you have to print out proof for each job you applied to (yes 39 separate pages, as well as write it all out on a form) and bring it to your meeting. if you don’t have a computer or internet you can go to the center and do it there.

2. you have to complete 20 hours of online education every week. you can choose from several topics - accounting, it, healthcare, childcare, legal, etc. again, if no computer you’ll have to go to the center to do it 

3. you have to attend in person workshops monthly. i believe it’s mandatory to do at least 2. job prep,  interview prep, resume help. each workshop is at least an hour plus commute.

i understand the goal is to get a job. a lot of these things are helpful. but it’s a lot to do for $250 a month. which barely helps. when you add up the 80 hours of online classes, the workshops, the 2x a month caseworker meetings…. it’s kind of ridiculous.

just venting. is this the same in other states??"
"car payments | anyone else in ga not scheduled to get the emergency allotment? hi, i was recently approved for snap although i am only receiveing $20  month. how exactly does car ownership work ? i have a 2015 prius but i still owe around 6300. my payments are 250 a month but i dont remember being asked about that on the interview or adding the payment in when i filled out the application. thank you! i'm in ga by the way.

hi, i thought everyone on snap in ga was supposed to get the emergency allotment. i got my regular deposit of 20 bucks today and thats all i am sheduled to get. last month on december the 1st it showed me getting the 20 and then 230. i usually get the emergency allottment on the 27th.  but its not scheduled. anyone have any ideas? thanks!"
"how did you meet the food stamp requirements? michigan has a new requirement for food stamp recipients. they're requesting that we work 80 hours per month (or 20hours per week) at a non-profit. we would have to work there for 30 days before we can submit an application. if you are approved you'll get a monthly dispersement of $193 in food stamps. i don't have reliable transportation and my case worker knows that. they even sent out a notice to me indicating that if transportation is an issue, you'd be exempt from the requirement. in addition our health insurance has the same requirement as food assistance and i was exempt from that. 

i'm still looking for a new job in the meantime so thats another hurdle. but i think these are the early signs that they're trying to eliminate the food assistance program for low income recipients."
"cal fresh experience hello everyone! i’m wondering if anyone has any experience with cal fresh? i believe we qualify in terms of wages, however when i looked at the paperwork that they need it says things like utility bill and rent and all of that.

any advice or certainty we won’t get approved?"

"hi! i live in georgia and just got my first round of benefits last month (december) on the 7th continuing from the title; i’ll try to keep this short as i’m in need of help pretty badly and really want somebody that knows what they are talking about to hear me out. i was initially told my benefits would renew on the 23rd, which i’m pretty sure i read somewhere that’s decided by your dl #. well, since i received my benefits on the 7th, i questioned if i would receive another round on the 23rd, my day of renewal. that was not the case, as the automated voice told me my next deposit would be the 7th of january, which made perfect sense, a whole month cycle, i thought great, that’s fair. well, the 7th rolls around (which is a saturday) and my benefits have not hit my card yet. confused, i call the same number which is just a robot, now telling me my next deposit is on the 23rd! since it was saturday, everywhere was closed so i had to wait until monday to try and figure this out. monday rolls around, and it turns out i still can’t get anybody on the phone to discuss this with. i’ve called the office in atlanta, my case worker, the local office here in my town, my case workers supervisor, every number under the sun related to human resource services and i have still yet to talk to a real human! it’s almost two months without receiving my benefits! that doesn’t seem fair and i’ve left voicemail after voicemail trying to get intouch with anybody. just hasn’t happened yet. any suggestions, please?"

"missing needed proof hi everyone i'm new here but i really need some help!

i applied for calfresh a few weeks ago and yesterday i received a letter stating that i needed to provide additional documents for my husband. my problem is that they want proof that an account that was supposedly opened in my husband's name is closed, but we never opened an account with the company that they need proof for (i believe it was called drivewealth llc, but my husband and i are both confused because we both had to google it and neither of us recall opening an account with said company.)

i tried to call my case worker and nobody ever got back to me so i'm gonna try again in the morning, but my question is, has anyone else gone through something similar? and how do we resolve this?"
"welfare/food stamps hi, idk if anyone will see this or if anyone will know what to do, but i have no other options but to come to my favorite people and ask for help. so here's the deal; my gf applied for food stamps because she is struggling currently. they asked for recent pay stubs as they always do (she's applied before in the past) and after a week or so they approved her, but for only 23$. confused she asked them why? they said she made to much money to qualify for anything more. again confused she said ""how? i sent in two pay stubs that are 300$ and 600$"". they said ""oh well we didn't see any pay stubs with those numbers only pay stubs for 900$ and 1200$."" now those pay stubs are real, but they are from a year ago when she was with a different company and was getting better hrs but treated like total shit. my problem is they asked for recent pay stubs, those aren't recent those are a year old. is that even aloud? and what do they mean they can't find the pay stubs? she sent the stubs 3 different times to the main office in our area, and twice to the email they provided (the second time we even got confirmation from the dhs office that it was the correct email.) can they actually go and use pay stubs from a year ago to qualify or deny you if they can't find the most recent ones you've sent in? and if not what should we do because they are saying ""oops, out bad, but you will have to wait until november to re apply"" like wtaf...any help is kindly appreciated...thank you in advance"
"finally approved after a very stressful/complicated renewal process | question about co-signer of my vehicle | texas snap renewal denied i just wanted to thank everyone that gave me great advice and information on this reddit. i was approved today after being without benefits since june. my renewal didn’t get approved because the documents i sent in were electronically signed. when i sent in the proper documents they had closed the case even though they gave me a second deadline and were turned in before it. i found this out after waiting the 30 day processing and calling multiple time (getting different information each time). then i was told i needed to send a new application. sent it 7/14/23 with all the documentation and waiting till 8/14. the lady i spoke to expedited my application and the next day i was told i needed to send in more check stubs and the value of my vehicle. i just sent everything in and was approved almost immediately. i am so grateful for this reddit because i’ve found so much information i couldn’t find anywhere else!

thank you all!

(i forgot to add that i live in texas)

i received an update about my texas snap case that i need to send in the value of my vehicle. i have a friend that is my co-signer on the vehicle that doesn’t live with me. will this effect my case? i was also wondering how the $5000 max asset work if you owe money on the vehicle?

my renewal was denied june 2 due to “requested documents not turned in”. i called because i did send in all the documents. after multiple phone calls/long waits i found out it was because my child support document said my last payment was sept 2022(i haven’t received any payments since) and the forms they sent me were electronically signed. i sent in a letter explaining i hadn’t received child support since sept 2022 and hand signed/sent in the forms by june 13. i called multiple times asking if i needed to send anything else. everyone told me i just needed to wait the 30 days to process the documents. this monday i was told to call today if i haven’t heard anything(it’s past the 30 days). the person i spoke to told me my case was denied and closed on june 13th due to the forms being electronically signed and that i needed to send in a new application because they most likely won’t reopen the case. i sent in a new application but am so frustrated and upset because i haven’t received benefits since may. i’m a single mother and my daughter has been on summer vacation. it’s been really difficult to buy groceries and keep her fed. does anyone know how long it could take for the new application to process? is there anything i can do it get emergency benefits or speed up the process?"
extra benefits indiana i had 9 pending deposits of 33.50$ for today and they have all in fact been deposited.  i called the snap office to report a possible error and was told i was the third to report these extra deposits.  i was informed that the deposits were legitimate and not given in error and are safe to use that all snap members in indiana are receiving them and that they actually don't know (in that office at least) why.  does anyone know why we recieved extra benefits?

"stolen cash aid claim denied…they “withdrew” $850 at an atm in one transaction…but no theft was found? i’m in san bernardino county, ca and last month my entire cash aid deposit was stolen immediately after it was deposited. 

i had my card in my wallet in my kitchen and was asleep when the “withdrawal” happened. they took it all in one transaction, which is not even possible, and they even misspelled the name of the street the atm is on. 

the county sent me a letter denying my claim because “no theft of benefits occurred”. i called the number on the back immediately after i saw it was stolen at 6:30 in the morning and did everything the person told me to and i did it within minutes of the call.

"when can i apply | texas food stamps question so my husband is going to be attending school to finish his degree. because of this both of us will be working part time. we have 4 kids and will be making under 30,000 a year until he is done with school. 
he just left his full time job because classes start in a week and a half. i will also be starting my job in a week in a half as well. we are in texas. i know it states that you need 3 paystubs in order to apply. my husband has been working his part time job for a few months now (he has had 2 jobs but is leaving his full time one for school) so he has those pay stubs. can we apply using those pay stubs since that will be his new income now?

my husband will be attending an accelerated program to get his degree. in the mean time, he is working one day a week (12 hr shift). i will be working also at a school where my children (4 and under) will be attending (16 hrs a week). we will be making well under the poverty line for the time being until my husband finishes school. 
my question is, will they combine our hours worked to get to the 20 hrs to qualify for stamps or is it per person? like do we each have to be working 20 hours? combined we will be working 28 hrs total a week. 
thank you!"
"a study to understand the hurdles of applying for unemployment hi!

my name is sahoko yui. i am part of a team of researchers that are conducting a study to better understand the use and hurdles of unemployment information tools at the palo alto research center, a xerox company.

"nyc - head of household traveling abroad for 1.5 months, is any action needed? my parents live on their own in nyc and receive benefits. my mom needs to return to china and she can't return sooner than 1.5 months due to the lack of flights available. apparently there's a surge in travelling since covid restrictions have been lifted. my dad will remain in nyc. 

my mom was saying she needs me to help her cancel her benefits until she returns and to reapply, but i'm not finding any answers that calls for this action anywhere. if we cancel her benefits (forgive me if cancel is not the proper term), my dad will basically not have any means for food. we're also worried that she will be denied reentry to usa upon return. both of my parents are green card holders. 

and of course i get laid off so resources are really spread out... i am happy to send my dad money, but what happens with the food stamp benefit, and any reassurance regarding reentry would be greatly appreciated.

thank you so much!"

"not receiving calls or help food stamp issues? should i report?

 my boyfriend has health issues that interfere with his ability to hold a job. he applied for food stamps august 19th, needing  aid. he waited weeks for the phone call

. his benefits were shut off due to the 6 month case re- evaluation. received no letters. they left a voicemail that they would call to reevaluate his case and they never called . 

it’s been almost 2 months and no benefits. he sent in all the necessary paperwork last week and still no phone call . 
they told him last week when they requested documents “since you sent in an application in august, we can only give you one month of benefits. so we will need to redetermine your case” apparently now they’re re-evaluating the case every 3 months. 
it’s not his fault that he applied and they never called for weeks?

? he’s very confused. as am i. in the past he never had any issues getting benefits and always received them within a week or two. nothing on his end has changed. 
is there anything else he can do in the mean time? they won’t answer the phones when he calls. his caseworker is rude and doesn’t seem willing to help.
i understand being overwhelmed working for a government service but we’re struggling and there’s no way to get in touch with them because there’s never an answer when we call. idk where to turn to."

"which way is better? hi everyone!

this is probably a weird question. i've been living with family for years but have been getting food stamps. i explained that i buy food and eat separately from them, which is the truth, and they granted me a decent amount per month. but it was my mom's house and she passed away not long ago. if i stay there i'm stuck living with my sister, her daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend. it's too small there and i hate the overall atmosphere.

i have a fiancé who was living in a medical rehab center after having a stroke. he was recently discharged and we have gotten a low income apartment together. it's illegal for me to use my food stamps to buy food for both of us, so we need to apply for him to get them too. here is where my question comes in.

i have zero income. he has a military pension which isn't much but it's enough to pay our subsidized rent. he is still way below the poverty line and should be eligible for something. the dilemma is, how do we apply?

should i tell them i'm moving in with him and then we apply as a couple? or should we make an application for him alone and buy our food separately? will aligning myself with another person take away my benefits, even if that other person is also low income? has anyone here ever been in this situation? what did you do? how did it turn out? we are in utah.

thank you in advance."
"this is outrageous i understand long wait times considering the backlogs and understaffing, but this is incredibly excessive when you’re hardly given an option to be placed on hold in the first place. this is florida. estimated wait time was 80 minutes. i tried to place a call back and option 2 made me hold instead of placing a call back request. if they ever answer it will be a miracle."
"feeling grateful hi everyone,

i began receiving snap (calfresh) benefits this month. i wanted to make this post just to say i am so extremely grateful for this program.

i recently lost my job and got into a car accident shortly after. living on what savings i have has been stressful. thankfully, with snap, i feel more food-secure and, for the first time in a while, have been able to confidentially stock my kitchen with food. i initially felt embarrassed by the idea and after i finally qualified i wish i would have done it sooner.

compared to working on my disability claim and unemployment with the edd, getting calfresh was a breeze. their online application system is simple, intuitive and quick. my case worker is pleasant and i didn't feel judged for applying.

for those of you feeling hesitant about the idea, go for it! it doesn't hurt to apply! i also had no idea i could use my card at whole foods. and, no more .10 bag fee!

just wanted to share my story! any other benefits (like free museum visits) that i should be aware of?"

"cola on va disability caused a decrease in snap benefits how stupid is that? ""because the government adjusted your income to match inflation, we will now adjust it again because fuck you."" that income should not even count toward snap at all. it isn't taxable and isn't considered income for several other government programs. it isn't even income, its compensation for the military ruining my life and making me unemployable. the government really hates poor people."

"simplified reporting question i am unemployed since the pandemic began. i had snap during the year prior and the benefit increased for the year after i was laid off. during the next renewal a caseworker called me, and asked me to verify info,  and she told me that there was no need to report a change in income unless it went above a certain amount, which it hadn't because it was still zero. as a single parent i didn't even think about returning to work until i was sure school wasn't going to be closing anymore, and the stimulus finally ended. however my mother did start to help me with bills, gas and expenses when the money ran out. the amount is definitely way below the amount i was told had to be reported, so i didn't report it. my question is, was i supposed to have reported this at any other time than when they called? if so does this mean that i have probably received overpayment and'or will this me treated as fraud?"
"update 10/2022 for walmart ebt shopping online. update 10/2022 for walmart ebt shopping online.
hi i'm new here. i was having the same problem with checking out, through walmart online, with my ebt card.
i found a solution. 

-enter your ebt card number before or during the transaction under your wallet.
-go to ""your payment method"" under wallet,
-then enter your new payment method as your ebt card. then save.

(this will allow you to add your entire ebt authorized number. without missing any digits)

-after you've entered your ebt under your payment method wallet, hit refresh
-now the entire number will show up at the end of your transaction and you will be able to put in your pin without any complications.
-if you add your ebt number at the end of your transaction it does not accept all the digits on your ebt card. therefore, causing an error message.

hope this helps."

"calfresh letter of approval and denial - how to adjust current income? hello friends, 

i just received a notice of calfresh approval *and* denial in the same mailing. because i also received a card separately, hopefully i was approved? 🥹

my questions are about the current income shown and how to adjust it. the approval amount is for $23/mo, and it shows my income as $1950.30 and my irt as n/a. when i applied i used old pay stubs, because i was just laid off, so the amount is much higher than my actual income. since then, my only income has been a small amount from edd, so my monthly income is not reflected accurately. 

- is it possible to update the income to reflect the actual amount that is well under the amount reported? if so, what’s the best way to do that? does this require an appeal, or can i call or submit an update somehow? 
- does edd payment count as income?
- why is my irt n/a? 

apologies for all the questions, but i have been digging into so many documents and websites am pretty confused. any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated! 

thank you kindly 🙏"

"what year would an irs matched income notice be for? (michigan, dhs-4487) | mi snap (& medicaid) case worker denying self-employment cost of goods sold expenses that weren't purchased recently. i just got an electronic notice that a michigan dhs-4487 letter is being sent to me, which is about an irs match for either earned or unearned income.  it's my understanding the letter will say exactly what it's about, including who it's from, the amount and type, etc.  it's probably going to be a while before i get the letter.  can anyone say what period the matching is for if the notice is being sent out now?  i don't know if they go back years, or if this would likely just be for 2022.  i'm not sure what this could be, and am hoping to have some idea of what it's about.

accounting 101: when a business (or person operating as a sole proprietorship) purchases inventory for the purpose of resale, it's not an expense.  the business is exchanging one asset (i.e. cash) for another asset (inventory.)  the cost of the inventory is only an expense once it is sold.

until about 3 years ago, i had self-employment income from reselling products online and submitted monthly michigan dhs-431 statements with copies of receipts for all expenses, including for the actual inventory sold during that period.

after about 3 years without self-employment income, i started selling online again.  i timely filed my notice of change of income and started submitting monthly dhs-431 statements before even hearing back from my caseworker.  they just sent me a notice saying my ""old"" merchandise expenses can't be used as verification for current expenses.

obviously, i can't submit old non-inventory expenses, but inventory is just different.  maybe she doesn't understand the invoices provided are for the actual inventory i just sold, but i'm pretty sure she's now thinking i can only deduct inventory expenses if it's purchased in the period the dhs-431 covers, or at least is fairly recent.  that's just not how it works.  the same caseworker years ago accepted inventory receipts that were years old without a problem.  :-(  i understand they're not trained accountants.

i'm writing a letter back, and i'm struggling to justify my position with a slam-dunk that will hopefully avoid yet another administrative appeal.  michigan bem 502 is for self-employed income, and pg 3 says ""countable income from self-employment equals the total proceeds minus allowable expenses of producing the income... allowable expenses include all of the following: identifiable expenses of labor, stock, raw, material, seed, fertilizer, etc...""  i can argue that especially because i sell many types of products and few quantities of each, that i can easily identify the expense of my stock with an invoice, even though it's years old.  many of the invoices are for the only time i've purchased that specific item.  but, the bem doesn't go into further details for timing of expenses for cogs.

bem 502 refers to 7 cfr 273.9(c)(9).  (well, it refers to 7 cfr 273.9.1 in a typo because that doesn't exist.)  this cfr refers to 7 cfr 273.11(b)(1) which has the language bem 502 copied pretty much word for word.  but, neither of these cfr's or any related ones spell out the timing of expenses for cogs.  i searched michigan and federal caselaw, and found no on-topic cases about these regulations.

is there anything else i can include, like authoritative sources, to try to avoid having to go through an administrative appeal?  i mean, i can include source authoritative for accounting and taxation about the timing of deducting inventory, but i'm hoping for something more on point.

note bem 502 does allow a new business (or perhaps one with a substantial change in business income) to file an estimated schedule c, even if not actually filed, but that's listed as a medicaid verification source only -- not food stamps.  i know i'll have to give an estimated schedule c for medicaid since the dhs-431 isn't usable for that, but i'm just pointing out submitting an estimated schedule c doesn't fix my food stamp issue."
"what electronic methods are used to verify income? besides equifax work number, what other electronic resources does social services use to verify income when applying for food stamps? is income always verified electronically? what happens if a discrepency is detected? such as if a client accidently failed to report parts of their income.

"college student, dependent and live with other students - pa | moving into my partner's apartment for the summer - how will this affect my situation? i'm a college student and i'm still a dependent. however, i don't live with my parents, instead, live with housemates. we pay for our rent and groceries separately. recently applied for snap, filled out an online questionnaire (that was quite confusing), and got accepted: 

1. does being a dependent affect my snap? whenever the online questionnaire asked questions about ""household"", i always assumed that i was the only individual in my household. the caseworker also didn't ask me if i was a dependent during the phone interview. however, i told her that my parents send money for my rent + utilities and had to provide a letter with my parents' signature stating that. 
2. in regards to the ""household"" questions, was i supposed to include my housemates in the online application? again, the caseworker didn't ask about housemates. however, my housemate also recently applied for snap benefits. i'm worried about a future audit where they see our address with two people and fault us for not reporting that we live with people.

currently, i'm a college student and i rent a place with a few friends. in the snap application, i mentioned that i pay for my portion of the rent + pay for my own groceries.

however, in a few weeks, my lease for the apartment will end and i will stay at my girlfriend's apartment for the entire summer. the plan is to split the rent equally + split groceries. i'm going to be paying approximately the same rent + groceries as before. 

what should i update/tell snap regarding my home address change and situation change? i don't want my benefits to be decreased or changed.

"milk no longer eligible? hey y'all. creaky old guy here, on calfresh in central california for a bit over a year.  i can't get out much, so i have groceries delivered by walmart (friends got me a walmart+ membership so i don't have to pay delivery fees). anyhoo, as of jan 2022, my usual great value vit d milk (gallon) is no longer eligible for ebt. as a matter of fact, most liquid dairy products no longer have the ""ebt"" badge.  i spoke to the store csr over the phone and she said she had no idea why the gallon of milk isn't eligible anymore, but i could pay $1 more and get 2 half gallons.
is this a calfresh thing, or is this a walmart thing?  is there anyone to contact about this? are stores at liberty to accept ebt for some items, but not others that are on the eligible list?"
"nm snap-- work/work-like requirements? i'm a graduate student towards the end of my program. on top of classes i have a 20 hour/week unpaid internship, and work about 17.5 hours fri-sun. i just had my recertification phone interview and learned that college students need to work at least 20 hour/week to qualify for snap benefits. previously, i've been over that amount because it was pre-internship, and so i had forgotten to consider it as an issue.

after some searching i saw one nm document say, ""a snap recipient identified as an abawd must meet a **20 hour-a-week** work or work-like requirement in order to maintain eligibility.""

my question is if my unpaid internship would count under ""work-like,"" and how i would report these hours to hsd? another option might be to increase my work hours, but my time is already very tight. does anyone have some insight on this? thanks!"
"fl snap - caseworker may be using incorrect amounts (gross instead of net) i've been struggling with my application process since early july, the online submission and update process is not great and i feel like the system is purposely more difficult than it needs to be.

trying to get through on the phone interview is as difficult as everyone knows...and this was prior to hurricane ian.

my spouse is disabled so the means testing is scaled for that;  you can qualify using the gross or net income amounts.  when we initially applied, i was receiving unemployment and was told that our gross income was too high but nothing was ever said about qualifying using our net.  i started working two weeks into september so our income went up by an entire $70.00/month.  

early this week they finally (!) made a determination on the changes to income i filed in september, we received $86.00 benefit for september with a letter explaining that we don't qualify for october because our monthly gross income is now too high - again, with the gross income limits and a mention of an income limit amount that i don't recognize. 

i can't get through on the number listed on the notice letter, a recording says it's no longer available for interviews and i must call the 850 number - but you can't really get through there either because either the system is too busy or if you hold for a representative your call is disconnected.

i know it's especially busy now, if there were a better way of checking the figures on the website i would do it & save the trouble of trying to speak with someone.

are the caseworkers aware of the fact that households with a disabled member can qualify using either the gross income, or if that is too high, then also using the net income?"

"question about work requirements hello, sorry to be a bother but currently i have a very particular question. my brothers wife was receiving snap benefits in texas, they are married but living separately due to some family issues so he hasn't been on the benefits just her and his son. now, he's planning on moving her in with him and applying for benefit for the three of them. my question is, currently they both don't work they are both going to school, he takes care of our mother in exchange for rent, that is a daily thing and is sometimes there anywhere from 20 to 40 hours a week. my mother is disabled and is considered a separate household. with that said they make do with their fafsa to cover bills, would they still be eligible for benefits? and would he still have to worry about the work requirements? or could he be considered self employed as he technically works for our mother as a caretaker in exchange for rent. the wife again is going to school as well and takes care of their 6 year old while also homeschooling him. due to this she isn't able to cover childcare or get childcare so she can work.

i've been under the impression that you could get benefits if you have children dependants. regardless of employment. just looking through the qualifications it does look like you are only eligible for benefits if you're employed. but maybe i'm missing something??

"ga snap 15% increase (rant) | when will ga get the 15% increase ? | no 15% increase in ga so it is now march and the ga snap recipients have yet to receive the additional 15%. it has gotten to the point where dfcs has stopped answering people's questions as to when it will be available. i understand that the agents are getting tired of being asked, but it has been about 3.5 months since this legislation was passed and we have received nothing. i understand it takes time to review a system but does it really take 3 months? every other state has given out their money so what is taking georgia so long? i understand it has to be programmed into the system and everything but whoever has that job has dropped the ball. the same generic message has been given to people for three months and now from what i have seen and heard people are reporting the ga snap program and honestly i don't blame them.

i know we were approved for the max allotment which the rest should hit my card on the 29th. however, that amount is just to bring me to the regular maximum before the increase.  when are they adding the 15% to the ebt cards?

so far the state of georgia has not done their 15% increase in food stamps. all they keep telling people is that they are reviewing their system and can provide no updates. for anyone who works for ga dfcs can we get some insight as to what is going on? why don't they just apply the 15% increase either when the first deposit hits or when they do the emergency allotment at the end of the month.?  it doesn't take long to get that so why have we been waiting over a month for a 15% increase or extra $30 per person?"
"ebt balance not matching my hra snap balance(new york) when i log on to the hra snap website i’m told i have a balance of $917. however when i call the number on my ebt card as well as when i log in to ebtconnect they both tell me my balance is $1317. how can this be? i tried calling to ask about it but can’t get in contact with anyone that can help. 

i only have food stamps and no other benefits at all and the balance of $1317 is purely in ebt food.

can anyone explain this? has anyone seen something similar?"
denied kombucha in ca snap/ebt (contains alcohol) i was denied purchasing kombucha in ca because it has 0.5% alcohol (certified non-alcoholic) worst part is they couldn't remove it from my receipt and now vons is saying it may take up to 30 days to get my funds back. ($192 monthly grocery purchase) at first they said 3-6 days but now after talking to the store regional manager they are saying up to 30 days and i have no money left for food. i explained this to them and they just said well hopefully you get the money back sooner but we can't do anything.
"question about ending benefits hi! my food stamps expires in 2024, i'm wondering if when they do, can i reapply? i'm unable to work so i can't just provide food for myself when it ends."
"sorry if wrong sub | losing them next mths. m not rly sure where to post this. i am just wondering from someone's personal opinion i guess. is it worth it to get married legally ? if i wanna keep snap among other  benefits.  i have this irrational fear that if something happends to my boyfriend (rn) that i will be left with nothing , no independence.  also if we have a kid down the line can they go on his benefits if we r not married legally? i don't really care to get married legally if it is better for me. however. i am curious can we still do a wedding reception/cermomy/engagement without the legalties of it or is it not worth it f27

has anyone been successful with finding a job/volunteer work for 20 hours ? i have been struggling and scared bc my ebt benefits will be gone after this month. any suggestions what i can do about it. f 20s md"
"california - can my brother also apply for calfresh separately? | can i use ebt out of state? los angeles county -

i'm currently receiving calfresh benefits for myself only. can my adult brother who lives with me (we live at parents) also apply for calfresh for himself? was just wondering if there would be a problem for multiple people in one address/household to have separate calfresh accounts since we are family. we are both independent adults though so i'd rather not add him as a family member to my calfresh account.

i’m from los angeles, traveling to hawaii. will i be able to use my card for food there?"

"i'm not on food stamps but i just wanna ask if what my company is having us do is legal. so i work for a company that will not be named.  we have cold and hot sandwiches, cold can be purchased with ebt food stamps but hot food cannot.  our new rm is asking us to sell the food cold to those with ebt and then cook it for them in order to boost cold food sales.  i'm just wondering if this is legal as it's unlawful in my state to sell hot food using ebt and this seems like it's gonna get us in trouble, especially given how we have 3 regular customers who literally work for the unemployed office and get a hard on from reporting unlawful use of ebt food stamps.

how far will they go back to prove fraud? i’m curious how far they can/will go back when trying to find foodstamp fraud? is there a statute of limitations? in florida.

got our ebt card yesterday in the mail! super relieved! but we didn't get the letter stating how much a month we were approved for or any other info. 

i checked if there was any balance on the account yet, and there is an insane amount deposited onto it on the 22nd

i think it's half of february(since we technically got accepted early-mid feb) and preloaded for march. 

is that what they do when you receive a card towards the end of a month?

does anyone know how the process goes moving state to state? new jersey to pennsylvania to be exact. 
do i have to reapply? does it get transferred over?
who do i contact? 
any idea how long inbetween we could be without assistance? 

thanks in advance!"
"[california] additional cal fresh deposit today. wasn't expecting | [california] pandemic ebt cards reissuance | california-cal fresh checks bank accounts? i'm in california. for the past 6-7 months i've been getting my additional cal fresh deposited around 17th, 18th each month. i received deposit today which is odd. did any you received additional payment today the 8th? thanks

so, does anyone know if they have approved the pandemic ebt cards? not the normal cal fresh cards, but the ones that were issued months ago to all qualifying school age children. i received 2 rounds of them, which helped out tremendously. but what's the status? i thought they had approved a 3rd round of them? any insight? thank you.

hello, im curious to know if cal fresh truly checks bank accounts, to find out your financial situation."
from sahm to very part time employment i’m super confused about the irt wording in a few of the calfresh letters i’ve read. i was an unemployed/sahm that qualified for the max benefit amount for two people. my income was quite literally nothing. now i work one day a week and will take home about 700$/month under the table. my irt is 1200-1500$ (i can’t remember the exact amount.) do i need to report the 700$/month if it is that far under my irt? will this effect my benefit amount?
"[ca] overissued ebt because grad student forgot to apply for fafsa i got a notice today saying that the county overissued my ebt by an amount of $1800 because i should have been denied ebt due to my income being above the $1400 minimum. i was able to initially bypass the minimum because i am eligible for federal work study, and i have a letter from the school saying that i will be allowed to have an ebt at least for the academic year. 

the problem is: i forgot to apply to fafsa this year since it’s all but useless for grad school (except for this food stamp thing). i’m pretty sure i’m still eligible, since my income hasn’t changed since the beginning when i first applied, but i don’t know if i’m able to gain eligibility this late to the game even if i did apply.

i’m going to fight it anyway to reduce the payment to only include the months after the academic year that the letter states. what are my options for the rest? i’ll apply and hope to get another eligibility notice, but if i don’t, is my only option to suck it up and pay what’s left?

thanks for your help.

"errors in tx snap application multiple times what am i doing wrong? i applied for snap benefits 1/26 and received a letter asking for docs 2/17, i’ve spent all weekend pouring over the information they are requiring but am really confused as to how they expect me to answer!  hope i can get some help here:

1) form 1028 employment verification - i’m unemployed, have been for over 2 yrs now.  they say i’m currently employed with a company i haven’t worked for since 2017!  i don’t have any old work stubs from that place and worked there for a month, i’ve put in a request to get the form completed by payroll but i can’t fathom why this is an issue when clearly i had reported my most recent job and it’s subsequent layoff/unemployment record to prove it.

2) & 3) verification of disability form 1836-a for me and my son (he’s 20 enrolled in college) - we aren’t disabled!  never checked a single box that said we were!  how do i prove i’m not disabled when i never said i was?

4) verification of exemption for e&t training services - i never tried to enroll let alone exempt myself?!  how do i enroll in snap e&t everywhere i look it says i’m enrolled once i’m approved for snap???

5) landlord verification letter - i have a mortgage, no landlord what do i do?"
foodstamps office knows i'm not working but is asking for proof? what? it makes no sense. i need to show proof to them inorder to get foodstamps but they know i don't work at my old job anymore. that makes no sense. -_- the government knows how much we make but we still have to file our own taxes.
"how can i get in contact with the snap interviewer? i’m desperate and hungry. hi, i’ve applied for snap weeks ago and was cold called for an interview right as i was walking into a doctor appointment and couldn’t talk. they gave me a number (ends in 7712) to call them back when i had time. i’ve called this number at least four times and each time was place on hold for 30+ minutes before the call dropped. i was just on hold for over an hour and then the call dropped. 

i just caught covid and am unable to work, i’ve become homeless and i don’t know what to do. i’ve been going to soup kitchens but the no-contact ones in my area are only open for one meal a day, there are more but they require me to be around people and seeing as i just tested positive for covid i can’t do that. 

does anyone know a number i can call that can actually get me to someone? thank you."
"extra deposit this month in texas was the extra deposit this month just a 1 time thing? i was thinking we got an increase, due to inflation, so i went crazy and spent 60$ on drinks.

"my case worker included the extra 300 boost | why am i getting a large amount of benefits? | whats the next steps? [california] so i was just able to receive the paperwork as to what my benefit amount is after my parents were included. however, their unearned income was not matching up so i gave the dpss call. the agent tells me thier unearned income isnt making any sense and that the case wprker added the extra 300. from my understanding it wasnt supposed to be added. ive been having multiple calls with dpss about this question and some say no but ive had a couple state yes. im just really confused bc my benefit amount for food stamps is weird bc of the extra 300. does anyone have any insight onto this? its not supposed to be included right?

im a bit confused bc i supposed to off ebt due to getting a job but suddenly im receving 400-500 in benefits these past two months. does anyone know why im getting such large amounts of money despite being told i no longer am eligible? i did change my family size to 3 so i thought maybe its possible backlog of money?

"florida snap account applied for snap and my account says no verification needed, no appointments scheduled. however when i go to the food assistance portion of my account, it says “technical question verification needed”. i uploaded my paystub but don’t know what else to do. i can’t get ahold of a real person when i call."
"calfresh got my address wrong for ebt | denied for calfresh, how to proceed? they sent my notices to the right address, but i haven’t received my ebt card yet bc they put the wrong address down for the ebt card.
i’m in alameda county, so every single time i call them to speak to a rep, the line has been too busy and they end the call right there. 
i’ve tried going in person, but it’s hard to make the hours when i have work/classes.
 
are there any other alternative ways to fix that address???

i submitted my calfresh app in the alameda county on 8/3, and they sent me a mail notice that my initial interview appointment would be 8/3 at 3pm. of course, i did not receive this mail in time, and i also never received a call from them on 8/3 at 3pm. 

i had been trying to contact them weeks following that, but have yet to receive a call until today. i submitted a few more applications, hoping i would receive any response from them (which i understand is an issue, but i was not getting any info from them despite them saying they had)

in the call with my case worker, she was upset that i had submitted more apps within the 30 day range, but also said that she denied my case a while ago because i did not provide proof of work study. she kept saying that by me sending in more applications, that i was preventing other eligible people from receiving food stamps. the exchange ended in her telling me that she was gonna close my case or that my only other option was that i could appeal the denial. 

i did not know that i was missing this document. had i received this info from an initial interview, or any call from them, i would have provided the right form because i am eligible for work-study. apparently she mentioned a waiver from her end about her not having to do an initial appointment call? 

i am frustrated because i do have the right documentation, i just made a mistake in not providing the right form, but i never received any notice that what i had was not sufficient before a denial. what is the best course of action?"

after some discussion,  the mod team has found it necessary to clarify one of the [subs rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/about/rules/), specifically benefit trafficking, which is rule 5.

we have always interpreted this rule this way, and advocating fraud is one of the few things we immediately and permanently ban for,  however, it was not explicit. that's now been remedied,  as you can see if you want to look.

per the policy unit, there is a 30-day grace period through **june 21, 2023** to get benefits replaced back to october 1, 2022  if they were stolen. 

more to come,  i literally just got the notice about ten minutes ago.

edit: good call u/daguar

some of you who are in here more often than most may have noticed an uptick in trolls wandering in from other corners of reddit, tracking mud on the carpet, and leaving concern dander all over everything.  i think i've personally banned more people in the last week than in the three months before that, and just now i found myself actually having to delete enough posts from one user that the mod action log spans two pages of it.

**please**, i'm begging all of you, use the report function vigorously, and don't feed them.  i promise, we're paying attention to it - i generally review any posts i haven't personally responded to if they have more than about 4-5 comments, but we can't see everything all the time.

thank you in advance,

- troll poo cleanup squad

so, i've had to ban four people from the sub in the last week and a half for attempting to buy or sell snap benefits.

don't.  just... don't.   it's illegal for good reason,  doing so can wind up getting you actual serious prison time, or a lifetime ban from receiving public assistance,  or both. fraud is going to be a major topic in the coming months after the pandemic floodgates are closed,  and i am guessing that states will be tasked with pursuing it.

this sub has, and has always had, a **zero-tolerance policy on this issue**. it is literally the only thing we ban for every time if you're not a bot.

**edit 6/23** - per fns, the authoritative record for what waivers states are asking for is located [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/snap-waivers-flexibilities).

*link corrected - sorry,  fns moved it when i wasn't looking*

---

question:  *i live in ____ state, i just went though redetermination/renewal, and now they're saying my amount is ____ which is way less than the _____ that i was getting before.  why?*

answer:  this is almost certainly due to the reversion to normal, or as close to it as things are likely to get at this point.  your new benefit amount is very likely the **actual calculated benefit amount** based on your income, resources, household size, and countable expenses.

*why is this happening?*

in 2020, the federal government, as a part of the covid19 response, massively expanded snap benefits, for any state that had declared a state of emergency related to the pandemic, which was pretty much every state.  that initial burst of funding ended in march, and then was extended for several more months.  it is important to remember that this is a ***departure from program policy*** as an emergency measure **only**, and should not be construed as a change in business.

*what's changing, and what's staying the same?  i heard it's going to be this way until september...?*

the additional 15% benefit amount is staying the same through the end of september.  other state waivers that allow up-to-max-benefits are likely ending at the end of june.  at this time (mid-june) we have no information about what states may continue to receive that waiver for july, because it is approved on a month-by-month basis.  i would speculate that it will actually end june 30, because that's when the lion's share of the additional funding goes away, and most states don't have the reserves to continue to pump money into the program.

*will i receive any kind of notice about this?*

no, you probably won't.  the reason is that the feds classify a change like this as a ""mass change"", which is specifically excluded from having a reduction notice.  updates will probably be news releases and social media, but they won't send you anything specifically telling you.  if you've been surprised by this, this is probably the reason - if it helps, understand that a widespread notice by mail costs tens of thousands of dollars, which is probably the main reason there isn't a notice that goes out.  yes, it sucks, and we know it.

updates as they appear will appear here in a top-level stickied comment from the mod team.

over the last couple of weeks, the sub has gotten flooded with questions only tangentially related to the snap program. public assistance is difficult sometimes to navigate: we get it...**but**...a large number of these questions are about subjects that aren't something anyone here can answer.  examples:

*i am still waiting on ___. dae have this problem?*

this is very low-effort. we can tell you,  if we know, what the policy is about why information is needed, or help you figure out what to do about a delay is service delivery. we might even be able to help you connect with the agency you're working with if you're getting frustrated...but those answers are going to have to come from the agency.  they're the ones holding the reins. 

*my ebt card doesn't work at this retailer in this specific location. anybody know why?*

the answer to this is almost certainly one of two things : either your account doesn't have the balance you think it does and it's getting rejected for insufficient funds, or there is a problem with either the retailer's ebt processing or with the ebt system in that area in general. neither possibility is something that we're in a position to help with.

*i haven't gotten the pebt card/funds, and my friend got theirs*

pebt is functionally identical to snap at the user end, but it's a completely separate program with different requirements, criteria, and funding stream that is administered at a local level by agencies whose waivers on implementation vary by school district. saying we have no idea is a gross understatement. 

we may be able to tell you when funds are coming or if they're coming...but this is the main thing we're seeing over the last couple of weeks that i alluded to above as an adjacent program. pebt is a parallel track to snap that uses a lot of the same infrastructure underneath.

we're going to be modifying the sub rules and automod responses to give better answers, as well as point people towards resources, and the faq will get updated as soon as we're able. 

we're open to discussion on this,  so feel free to push back if you disagree or have some suggestions.

with a new year, new changes to snap are coming.  we're seeing lots of questions on this category, and this is a general ""you should know"" rather than state-specific. it is important to remember that states apply for waivers from the feds, and those can get approved or denied depending.

*  raising the floor and ceiling - my understanding is that the new omnibus spending bill raised both minimum and maximum allotment amounts for all households through june 30 2021.

*  pandemic supplemental - independently of the raise in amounts,  states are asking for on a month-to-month basis to issue up to the max amount. january amounts have been announced for some states as of this morning,  but that's being slower than it has been.  refer back to your state agency on this - we may know here, or we may not. 

*  automatic recertifications - some states are auto-renewing households for another six months.

*  no-interview waivers - some states have been approved for processing applications without interviews. check with your local agency when you apply on this.

**edit** - i'll update this or leave a stickied comment at the top as things change - i suspect there may be more changes coming.

**edit 2**: as suspected, the number of states has changed. look for this trend to continue,  as it's evident the feds are updating one state at a time. 

**edit 3 for june 2021**:  due to guidance from the feds, if you have a *calculated benefit amount* of **$0**, you will no longer be receiving any additional ea benefits. this likely means that you've been receiving the max like everyone else and will now get nothing. i suggest calling your elected representatives in dc if you're exercised about this,  as imo it's kind of a shitty thing to do to people. 

---

understandably, we're getting a lot of questions about this topic at the moment - this thread is intended to stem the tide a bit, so please keep commentary and questions on this topic here for the time being.

**what we know**:  ~~as of 4/6~~ per the federal [food & nutrition services page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/covid-19-emergency-allotments-guidance), ~~16~~ many states have been approved for the emergency allotment waiver.  i will hazard a guess that there are more in the pipeline, but because these waivers are granted at the state's request on a monthly basis, this is obviously subject to change on a state-by-state basis.

[guidance from fns as of 4/1/21](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-covid-emergency-allotments-phase-3-guidance.pdf) indicates that fns is expanding benefits for those states still in an emergency status to increase allotments up to $95/mo, for those households that have received less than a $95/mo increase from the emergency allotment waiver thus far.

because these changes will require additional updating of the data systems used to support snap issuance, it is possible, even likely, that some delays in the timing of these benefit implementation dates will occur.  again, because this is managed at the local agency level, what state or county you live in will be highly relevant in answering those questions - please understand that agencies are getting this information at nearly the same time that the public is being informed...so they may or may not have answers in the moment.

---

**going forward, there will be a moratorium on separate posts to the subreddit on this topic, to avoid flooding.**  while i can appreciate the continued stress over changes on this subject, i've also had to take down a higher than usual amount of inappropriate posts and comments in reply to posts, and that isn't serving anyone well.  if you have a question/questions on your particular state and you haven't found it elsewhere, make it a top-level comment here, and we'll do our best to help.

**please** read and refer to the following links before asking questions.

one final note - i have been considering inviting a representative from fns to do a q&a/ama on this sub.  thoughts?

hi all,

i've been seeing this question quite a bit. the answer is on  the food & nutritional services' covid waiver page, which is [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/snap-waivers-flexibilities).

good morning,  on what's sure to be an interesting monday. 

there is lots in the media from last week, and already this week,  about coming changes to the snap/food stamp program due to the covid pandemic. this thread will be an attempt to keep all of that in one place rather than a series of isolated posts in the same topic.

questions go here - please make them a top level comment so they're seen.  i'll have a stickied comment at the top that i'll try to update as things change. 

for non-snap questions about covid, please visit r/coronavirus. 

we're all in this together - it's going to be okay.

snap may be usable for grocery pickup [at wal-mart](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/fnm3dq/psa_walmart_allows_for_online_preordering_for/).

good morning, or evening, or whatever time of day it is where you are.  :)

this isn't a new concern, but it's come up from time to time, and the other mods and i felt it was appropriate to clarify, update the rules, and explain to the community what the change is and why it's being made.

a core concept with working in a human services capacity is the adherence at all times to a high ethical standard, and protecting personally identifiable information from misuse.  

in the sidebar, it says, ""all program experts participating are doing so in their private capacity - no advice given here should be construed as speaking on behalf of any federal, state, or local agency.""  the reason this is there is because reddit is not an official channel for information to get from agency to customer or vice versa - it's anonymous, and needs to stay that way.

if you have questions, you should never, under any circumstances, provide your personally identifiable information to someone on reddit. this puts you in a compromised position, and opens you up to the possibility of having that information misused, stolen, or otherwise compromised....and you should be aware that there is a growing ""recovery scam"" where scammers will ask for your information, knowing that you're already vulnerable.

if you're an expert, or you work in human services and want to help - people asking for help here need to be directed back to their local agency if it gets beyond general program help or advice.  you should never solicit or accept personally identifiable information - doing so means you are no longer operating in a private capacity, because you're offering to use your professional credentials without a valid business purpose, for someone whose identity you have not confirmed.  this poses a risk to this subreddit, to you personally, and potentially to either the customer who is asking for help, or to someone seeking to misuse that information.  because reddit is anonymous, providing them any help from that risks a disclosure of protected information, completely aside from hipaa.

i am leaving this post open for now, for commentary and discussion from the community, but please keep it constructive.

this morning,  i learned that several snap recipients in oregon have reported receiving a text message with a link.

> you have not availed your december food stamps. go here [fraudulent link] before they expire.

if you receive this,  **do not** click the link.  this has been reported by oregon to the federal food & nutrition services, which is our oversight body,  and they are investigating.  if you get it,  you should report it to your local agency for action.

greetings,  all,

as we start to emerge from covid quarantines, i have taken down the megathread (it's still linked in the wiki), and i've updated the faqs with some questions we're seeing a lot of lately. check 'em out!

if you have suggestions for the faq, please let us know!

i think i'll be adding a section in the wiki for the remainder of the covid program changes... i'm sure they're not done yet!

edit: link for faq - https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/wiki/faq

if you have lost food stores due to power outages,  you can get the benefits used to purchase those foodstuffs if the expenditure was from this month,  and you must request replacement within **ten days of the loss**.

refer to your local agency for specific guidance - you may be asked for receipts, or not depending on how it's being done.

greetings, everyone. 

the overwhelming majority in the discussion was supportive of banning political discussion on this sub. while the mod team is not going to take a heavy hand on this, this should not be construed as censorship or taking sides. 

program policy, policy changes, and discussion of impact are totally fine,  as are expressions of concern,  worry,  or frustration. calling out or generalizing one group or another on a particular side of an issue,  or perceptions of an ideology's support or lack thereof are not okay. 

we want to keep the tone here civil and productive - dragging off-topic generalizations doesn't help, and i think we can all agree that regardless what the national picture looks like over the next eight months, it's going to often be polarizing and ugly. nobody wins in those discussions. 

a complete list of the sub's rules can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/about/rules/).

good afternoon,  morning,  evening,  or whatever time zone you're currently in, and salutations from your friendly neighborhood mod team.

we've had a few incidents crop up - last night, most recently - of discussions devolving into political mudslinging. /u/songofstorms and i talked this morning,  and my thought is that,  particularly with the already-early tones of the oncoming political season, /r/foodstamps is a place that needs to be kept free of that sort of thing. 

i strongly suspect that as we get closer to november, even mentioning candidate names, regardless which one,  is going to end up descending into partisan vitriol. i don't think anyone comes off looking good as a result of that,  regardless of where your political leanings lie or how morally right you may or may not be.

i'm suggesting,  therefore,  that as a sub we adopt a strict non-politics rule. this is going to be a little difficult - it is, after all, a government program, but i'm confident we can discuss program specifics or changes without dragging fault or finger-pointing into it. i had thought to go ahead and just do it,  but i think it's always best to get consensus.

speak up, and let us know what you think.  i'll leave this up and stickied for a few days so people see it.

the currently unfolding situation here in oregon and california with the fires brings to mind something i thought i'd put up a reminder of.

snap benefits already used in the current month can be replaced by the issuing agency, if you can show that the food purchased with snap was lost due to something catastrophic and beyond your control - wildfires, flooding, home fire, hurricanes,  tornadoes,  etc. agencies differ on what they'll ask for in terms of verification - oregon historically takes a very lenient view, but other states may do it differently. 

to get this moving,  typically, you would want to make contact with your area's agency, and ask - explain your situation and ask what they'll need.  you'll probably need to know when and where,  and about how much,  you spent to start off with.

greetings all,

we've been seeing an uptick in the amount of questions about benefit theft, so we've added a post flair for it that should be orange. please use - users can add post flair for news (yellow) and question (red), and now this one. 

also - 6300+ subscribers!!

greetings, all.  a few updates on stuff...

it looks like the federal government has finally gone all-in for online ebt card use, which is amazing and a little scary. changes like this don't come along every day, and i suspect there will be fallout on it at some point,  just as the change from actual paper to ebt was 25 years ago. 

the list of currently participating states is [listed here by fns](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot). many thanks to u/dakotamidnight for the continual updates. 😁

---

the [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/wiki/faq) is still being updated. for newer posters here, *please* refer to it before posting your question - variations on ""where's my ebt card?"" have been asked and answered often enough to warrant a specific mention,  for instance. 

any suggestions for additional topics in the faq should be sent to the mod team.  seriously. please send us mail. we like it.

--- 

i had a thought i wanted to put out there for community discussion,  particularly from those members here with experience using snap (as opposed to program experts). it's sort of half-formed, and i wanted to explore it organically.

what would you all think about regularly featured topics for use of the program,  such as suggestions on best use/making it last, or how best to use the program for homeless populations,  or even cooking tips/recipes that might include suggested dietary substitutes?

i figured i'd update the community with what i know and suspect - everything is as things stand as of today, so bear in mind things can be fluid and may change.

**abawd waiver**:

oregon's waiver for able bodied adults without dependents is expiring for the entire state as of december 31,  except for lincoln and clatsop counties, and except for siletz, ctgr, klamath, warm springs, and one other tribe i'm drawing a blank on. what this means is that coming next year, the abawd clock will again be running for anyone not disabled, age 18-49, with no dependents in the household.

**current status of pandemic supplemental payments**

these are almost certainly ending may 31. we've applied for another month,  and whether we get it or not is up to the feds.

those are the two major things that we were updated on this week - tons more, but most of it is inside lingo that's only of interest to those of us working there. 😎

greetings all,

i got an email from our privacy & security folks this morning that i thought worth sharing since it's not a state issue. this was apparently passed along by the us department of health and human services office of civil rights division.

> it has come to the attention of the [ocr] that an individual posting as an ocr investigator has contacted hipaa covered entities in an attempt to gain protected health information.  the individual identified themself on the telephone as an ocr investigator,  but does not provide an ocr complaint transaction number or any other verifiable information relating to an ocr investigation. 

> hipaa covered entities and businesses associates should alert their workforce members, aaaand can take action to verify that someone is an ocr investigator by asking for the investigator's email address,  which will end in @hhs.gov, and asking for a confirming email from their hhs.gov address.

there's some contact info at dhhs on where to report concerns,  but the lead on it is being done by the fbi.

stay safe.

i've noticed we're getting quite a few of similarly themed questions, and thought i'd take a crack at doing an faq page in the wiki.

thoughts?

as a part of the debate on the federal debt ceiling, congress is expected to implement additional expansions of work requirements for snap, as well as other public assistance programs such as tanf and medicaid.

i wasn't able to find any reporting on this that wasn't *breathtakingly* partisan at this early point, so as this develops we'll drop news articles and info here.

**a word of caution on comments and discussion:** this subreddit's topic is all too closely linked to political squabbling. please keep the discussion facts-based, let's stay out of partisan finger pointing, everyone,  ok? thank you!"
i’m so upset i’ve applied twice to food stamps i have family of 4 one income and we legit make $200 to much to qualify i cannot save and barley pay bills on top food and gas😏 in utah*
what pre-workout can i buy with my ebt card? in california i've bought met-rx protein powder because it had a nutritional facts label as opposed to a supplement facts label but haven't seen a pre-workout with one. beet juice could do but i'd really like something with bcaa's if possible.
(california) anyone else having delays in receiving their deposit? im supposed to get my deposit every 6th of the month. its the 24th and  still havent received anything
"fraud investigation | fraud question again i don’t think i’ve ever posted to reddit before, so i hope this post comes out ok. my husband’s employer received a letter requesting his wage documents as i’m being investigated for fraud for our snap benefits (louisiana). i did do a recertification in march in which i put that he had quit his second job and i’m pretty sure i had to put in his income for his main job. they denied us which was fine because i figured his slight raise disqualified us. we got the letter last night from his hr dept and i’ve been sick to my stomach. i went on the online portal to see if i could look at my simplified report i sent in march and make sure i put everything in correctly, but it wasn’t available online. i did then see a notification that said my simplified report was sent back incomplete, but i didn’t see that notification earlier than yesterday and received no mail regarding it. all i can think of is that maybe i mistyped something? 

i then looked at my case file online. it had another person added to it that has the same first name as my 2 year old with a last name that is very similar (one letter off) and whole other ssn. i still have a copy of my application and i never added this person. she’s listed to be in her 60s, her income is not being used to determine our eligibility it says, and she “moved out” the home it claims. i have no idea who this woman is or why she’s on our case file, but i do have proof from my original application that i never claimed to have this person living with us. 

could all of this be one big computer glitch? i was up all night from the stress and i’ve been sick all day. i’ve never been arrested for anything much less accused of a crime. i’m absolutely terrified and the fraud investigator hasn’t called me back yet. 

thank you if you read this.

**update*** i was finally able to reach my investigator. i was right that she was just super busy and that’s why it took so long. she was so nice and made me feel much better. our bonuses may not even matter she said, but if they do we can go on a payment plan if necessary. she said right now with pandemic stuff all of these kinds of issues are being labeled as unintentional errors or something like that.  i feel so much better and i’m no longer getting physically sick from worry. thanks to everyone who gave advice on this thread and my other one. 

hi again. i posted not too long ago about being under investigation for fraud. i was very confused as to why and then i realized it was because i completely forgot to report income we earned in 2020. it’s all in my previous post, but to recap: we made very little in 2019 and got on fs january 2020. in 2020 my husband earned a few bonuses through work for his sales numbers. they put us around 5k over in gross income for the year. i just didn’t even think to report it because i’m apparently an idiot and i continued to use our card for monthly groceries. once i knew we were under investigation i went through everything i submitted and our financials and that’s when i realized my dumb mistake. 
i’ve called the investigator several times, but she won’t call me back. i’m sure she’s very busy, but i feel so sick to my stomach. the kicker is that we received a lot of money each month because of the pandemic. i didn’t use all of it, but i did cover all of our groceries each month with the extra pandemic allotment (around $800 a month). so, i probably owe thousands back for the whole year of 2020. i still have about 5k on the card, but i haven’t been using it even though our income went back down. i just want to close the card out completely. 
my question is, should i just go to my local dcfs office and tell them i realize that i messed up and didn’t report income? i really want to make this right and i’m terrified of criminal charges because of the amount of fs i used. i’m sorry if this post is redundant, but my anxiety is through the roof. i am absolutely terrified. i have a newborn and other kids and the thought of going to jail is horrifying. i’ve never even received more than a traffic ticket before. i’m hoping they let us use the child tax credit money to just pay it all back. i am so sick to my stomach over this. am i going to go to jail?

eta: just for clarification, the bonuses were not monthly income, but a quarterly thing. it wasn’t like he got a permanent raise (at that time- he did in march 2021 but our case closed then and we stopped receiving benefits then)."
"is anyone else ebt card not working in pa﹖ hi for the past hour i've been trying to use my ebt card to order groceries online at first i thought that it was the first app i tried but then when i switched and tried another one it still didn't work.

is anyone else having this issue ﹖"
several food items not being covered i keep getting items that food stamps won’t cover even though they are supposed to. it’s happened twice at walmart. i double check all stuff through the walmart app and everything always says ebt eligible. when i get to check out though it won’t cover the item. i don’t understand why and it’s stressing me out when i go to buy food now
"how do you go about reporting that you started working to ebt in florida? i am currently unemployed but looking to start work again soon
i'm wondering how it works when you do start working do they cancel your food stamps automatically?
or did they basically look at your income or what your income is going to be and readjust your monthly food stamps?
i guess the real question is how do i even report getting a job? i don't see anywhere to do it on the website and they never answer the phone

what if i were to start working not report anything and continue to use the monthly ebt payment?
could they charge me with fraud or they just make me pay the food stamps back if i spent too many?"
"can you send in a sar 7 online? i went home for spring break and missed my sar 7 form submission by almost a month. i was notified that my benefits were canceled, so i went online to submit it immediately. should i still send in the paper form? also, will my benefits continue if everything checks out despite being late?"
"ebt card was approved for emergency foodstamps around 7/21 through august until i submitted forms. they were submitted and got another letter on the app saying i was approved through december. do they wait until the forms are submitted to send the card? i still haven't received it. 
in texas :)"
"first time applying- what should i know/do? hi, i am 21 y/o and live with my mom (not on lease here) in texas. i know that i make less than the maximum amount and my mom was on leave (unpaid) last month...but for whatever reason im just so confused on what to do. my mom just keeps saying i have to ""work the system""??? idk what that means... i have adhd and often need to be told exactly what to do. if i could receive any guidance it would be so appreciated- please use layman's terms!"
fl expedited interview number i qualify for expedited interview and i call the 850 300 4323 number and there is no option for interview. what number should i call?
"va ebt application help hi everyone. i was wondering if virginia has an asset limit? i currently work a minimum wage, part time job but do have over $3000 in savings. however, some of that will be taken out soon for rent and other random expenses. 

i’m just wondering if someone can help determine if i’m eligible. thank you"
"psa receiving your ebt card in mail (ebt in boston) if you live in an apartment and have one of those mailboxes at the apartment entrance with the names of everyone living there, your name needs to be on there in order for the ebt card to be delivered! 

i just moved and hadn't had the chance to update my name on the mailbox, and my card was never delivered. had to come in person to the snap office only to be told this. hope this saves other people the trouble."
"(va) are those who are unemployed earning more food stamps or is there a specific cap based on other things instead? | (va) so there's a amount cap on earnings. if you make under a certain amount it says i don't have to disclose any information with employment does that mean during my interim i should still be allowed to keep them? | if i'm technically not on a lease and stay with a few different people with my child and i say i'm technically homeless is there potential for cps to try and intervene? i make such low amounts that i'm not even required to inform them that i have a job due to the net monthly income i earn like 1/3 of the cap. because of that i was not supposed to report my income change

so, now that i have a job and make such a low amount am i going to get less food stamps now after my 6 month interim thing where i go in to talk to them again ?

basically i got foodstamps when i was unemployed. i got a job but then since i made under a specific amount it said on their income chart that changes under a certain net amount do not need reported. 

my question is i am going to obviously tell them that i am employed but seeing as how i make a amount low enough to not need reported should i still actually be able to receive them?

like how do they determine who gets foodstamps or doesn't? should i get the same amount as before since i still am not making much for now?

i'll have enough eventually where i won't need stamps anymore but as of right now i am going to financially be destroyed if they stop giving me these

so i'm going through a hard rough patch and food stamps could really help me out. 

i however have no home of my own and bounce around at various houses. if i put down homeless for my food stamp app are they going to potentially think my child is neglected? she eats like a horse and has a ton of toys at every house we stay at and her life is normal despite my struggles. i have sacrificed very hard to make it that way.

i will just flat out continue to struggle my ass of if this is gonna get me potentially investigated.

i'm almost certain this is not the case because homeless on the street and not owning your own home are vastly different and i'm guessing they see both sides of this. 

my daughter is well taken care of and it's me that goes without. so how does this work?"
"ebt card came with no benefits on it so i have applied and been given my first ebt card, and i got my pin and everything, but when i tried to check the balance on it it says there are ""no existing benefits associated with the card"". i tried calling the number on the back of the card, and they were useless. they gave me the number for my county's social services, and they hung up on me (and have the worst phone operating system ever). i even downloaded the provider app, and the balance says $0 so i just do not understand how i got this card but nothing comes with it. i can't even find out if its supposed to come in a few weeks or what. nobody/nothing has been helpful."
amazon prime does anyone use their snap $$ to buy food on amazon prime? i’m interested in items that are cheaper than at walmart or other big box grocer. they’ve got $10 off an order of $25+ with promo snap2510 right now that i’d like to take advantage of
"didn’t receive benefits for 12/2022 i reside in the bay area , ca and got approved for cal fresh ebt as of november 2022. that month i received up to $700 on november 23. this month of december i have not received my monthly payment only the extra allotment."
"(calfresh) do i need to report/how do i report income that is highly variable? i stream online and occasionally people will subscribe and i get some a few dollars from that. i also sometimes get $20-100 gift cards as gifts. but this is never a monthly guarantee. 

do i need to report this income everytime it happens?

"my partner and i got our snap amount increased because he’s not working, what do we do when he finds a job ?(az) i have been on snap for over a year now. since my partner doesn’t have a job it increased substantially… he hasn’t found a job yet but when he does, when are we suppose to report it?"
i am so stressed out. i sent in my recertification back in august along with my pay stubs. it was due september. i just got a notice saying my food stamps are being closed bc i either didn’t provide everything or had an interview. the paper they sent me for recertification said nothing about… an interview. i called the statewide number and even they were confused why i wasn’t approved and they said my caseworker didn’t even put a reason why in the notes. i’m in pa. they said they put a request in for my case worker to call me. this is so stressful bc i am now not getting paid for october. i wish they wouldn’t have waited until right before i was supposed to get paid to deny me! anyone else going through this in pa?
"didn't report move change got out of the military about 3 months ago, and didn't report a move change with az snap. i'm at the end of my 6 months eligibility now. should i just let it end? obviously, scared of jail time..."
"question about item substitutions for online purchases so due to the weirdness of eligibility for some items online, it is theoretically possible for an item to be substituted for a version of the same thing that isn't actually eligible for ebt, if that happens would the new item then be charged as a regular purchase or would it still somehow be covered by the original ebt payment"
"mother is on 0 income - can’t get food assistance hi, my mother gets assistance from the government on her rent (partial), but she is retired and thus 0 income. 

 she applied and said she qualifies for $12.00 a month!  

makes no sense to me. residents in virginia. she is 67. i hep her, but would be nice if the taxes she paid her entire life would help her back out.   

any assistance is appreciated!"
"texas foodstamp hi! i applied for foodstamp last thursday and i noticed someone had left a voicemail but it was a weekend when i found out. i’m not sure who to contact for help. i don’t have any income, i’ve been trying to get a job but i haven’t had any luck. my husband is handling most of the bills from his unemployment. we have not paid our electricity, water bill and phone bill and we’re running out of food. where else can i get help from? i was doing ubereats deliveries from last year but my car is not working currently and has been in the garage for some time now. help! i don’t know where else to go. i’m scared we will be starving. is there any help i could find just until i get a job?"
"i qualify for snap (california), so what other government programs (in california) will i likely qualify for? i live in the santa clara county to be more specific. i would appreciate any tips or resources that could be of help! i’m struggling financially at the moment any aid for college, food, or utilities would be great!"
"october monthly balance question? i applied for food stamps sometime mid september. i received my card in the mail along with a partial balance of $140 (9/13-9/30). i used up that balance. then i got $90 (9/1-9/30). 

it’s the second week of october and i still haven’t received october’s balance. is this normal? do i have to use up my total balance before receiving another payment?"
"typical nyc bureaucracy (need help!) just had a robot tell me ""we are busy at this time please try again later"" after being on hold for 2 hrs and 53 mins. it's been almost 45 days since i applied for snap and other services at hra in harlem. they made me do everything on a computer and told me since covid there are no in person staff available to talk to and you have to do everything over the phone. every time i call i'm on hold for at least 2 hrs or so minimum and they often don't even answer. there sometimes is an option to have them call me back. i did that this morning but the never did. the first time i did connect with someone a week after my application, i could hardly hear them and they seemed very confused. they rushed me off the phone and i tried to plead with them to get answer ""are you sure my phone interview is complete?"" i asked because i've never done one that was that short he asked no questions. my hra still said my interview is due so i fought to get through again and when i finally did someone confirmed the interview was completed and said if i'm accepted i should have my benefits the first week of the following month. i called them after seeing no changes in my app and the interview due date still being there after the first, another fight to get some help. finally when i got through i was told it can take up to 45 days and no one is allowed to give me any help over the phone until after 45 days. it's now a cpl days from 45 days and nothing has changed 😭😭😭 is there any way to get help with this organization??"
"my food stamps just keep going down and down and down | can someone explain calfresh calculations for disabled? | why haven't i gotten my last month emergency allotment? can someone please help me figure this out? 

this is in california. 

i am on ssi, my husband is pending his ssi and not workin. i was getting $1140 a month and $363 for food stamps.

with cola i now get $1251.00 as of jan 1. that caused our food stamps to go down to 315. that sucked but okay i can handle it. 

then, we get a notice that they've gone down to $208 because we no longer pay rent (we bought our property, but our utility costs have gone up, and we live in rural area so gas to get anywhere is more, we can't walk anywhere like in the city, going to the dr is 160 miles round trip. for example. we pay propane water gas charcoal (no cooking facilities), phone, and medical expenses, car insurance, property taxes. 

so the only expense we no longer have is rent.  but everything else went up. 

somehow that took our food stamps from 315 to 208.

on the benefits change notice though the income they put is the same, the deductions are the same, expenses listed is the same only difference is the amount of the food stamps.

i don't understand.

i'm particularly confused as to the excess shelter cap removed. what does that mean and what's excess shelter? i own so i don't pay rent. if that makes a difference thank you

i understand it's ending. but i haven't gotten march's emergency allotment. does anyone know when it'll hit? i'm in ca. thank you"

"has anyone else had snap screw up on them? i just recently got on snap and it only lasted a month before they suddenly decided my income is too high. my partner makes the same steady amount that he always has, yet i got a discontinuation letter saying he makes like 500$ more than he actually makes. i never made any change, update, addition, removal, anything to my application or file or whatever. they sent me a bunch of stuff to use as ""evidence"" for my case. he earns around 2100 and they somehow came to the conclusion that he earns 120% more than he actually does. i got paperwork from them with evidence for my appeal trial as well as a hearing date but they even fucked up that by saying it's on september 9th, 2999 at 00:00 via telephone. what the fuck do i do? i'll probably just call them and ask where they got the info and when the hearing is and what i can do to prove it even though i gave them like 3 months worth of paystubs as well as medical records and a reasoning for why they fucked up, not me. has anyone else has a similar problem where they fucked you over with no proof?????

"help with getting a live person on the phone? hi! i'm applying for ebt/calfresh in ca for the first time, and am currently going through the process of getting all the forms and proof together. however, i had several questions about filling out a form  and also need to make a correction to my application, but whenever i try to call their office i get sent down an automated route that essentially tells me i'm not in the system even though i have double-checked and everything i've given it lines up with my application (birthday, ssn, phone number). i have no idea why it's doing this and it's infuriating they're asking for it first when i just have my case number sitting there. it basically just sends me on a loop of telling me my social or birthday or everything doesn't line up and there's not even an option to ask for another way. the county i'm in doesn't offer live chat and trying to call other departments and get transferred just sends me straight back to the automated line. i know i can go in-person but it's a long drive and i only have a little over a week to get everything in. if anyone has any tips it would be super appreciated."
"sar 7 question i started getting calfresh benefits recently and this is the first time i've had to fill out a sar 7 form and this feels like a dumb question but i don't want to screw anything up. i'm specifically confused by question 11 ""did anyone get money from any other source in the report month."" i'm a college student and get financial aid every semester and i get some money monthly from a trust my parents set up, but that was already recorded when i applied. do i have to report it again or do i only have to report if something changed? i've tried looking through google & here for clarification but i can't find anything this specific."
hi nyc does 18 year old income counts? still in high school hi i have an 18 year old who is working part time and the job is tied to her school.  when school is done for the summer so will her job. will this count or be exempt? is it ok to leave her off the application and not apply for her? my income is so low that even with her income we still qualify but i'm not sure she wants me to apply for food stamps with her in it.
"denial help | recertification help | reporting fraud hey! we’re in indiana and due to my husband receiving two hire on bonus, we were $2 over the income limit. what should our next steps be? my husband normally brings home $1800-$2000 a month. would appealing make sense? or do i just reapply?

also, i looked at the eligibility letter and saw that they had denied and it would be terminated, but when i click on the case for the food stamps it still says we’re getting them next month. when i had checked prior that page was empty, so now i’m confused.

our recertification appointment is coming up in the next week, and i remember briefly seeing that a household with a disabled person has different rules. our son receives disability payments, and he hadn’t when we first applied. does this mean the requirements this time will change? im having a hard time understanding changes, since it says on the site “all households (except those with elderly or disabled members) must pass a gross income test”
any assistance would be helpful.
also, if my husbands check on 12/2 includes the last bit of november, will that count as november or december income?
we’re in indiana as well.

i found out today that my felon brother got approved for food stamps. is he able to have food stamps with a current warrant out for his arrest? he used our grandmas address (our mom essentially) to apply and have his card sent there. no one knew until it came in the mail. he just stole $700 and left her with no money and now he does this. he doesn’t live there, and used her address as to not share where he is actually staying. is this reportable?"
"denied for liquid asset over $5000 (tx) | got the card with $300 benefit but forgot to send documents before due date | household | appeal in tx i own 2 cars and 1 is paid off, with its value estimated by kbb is $15,420. the other car is still on finance. can they count the financed car into my asset? can i still appeal or send in letters and documents to support my case? or should i reapply?

so my granny applied for snap in tx and they issued her with the card and the it was about $300. after that they sent the letter asking for more document but we didn't know and when we found out it already past the deadline. when we activated the card it still says her balance was $300. can we still use it?

hello, i'm in tx and trying to apply food stamps for our family of 3 (myself, my husband, and my newborn). we moved back to my mom's house to reduce cost of housing and we pay her $500 for house rental but we pay for food and everything independently. do i still need to report her information and income while applying? i heard that if you're adult over 22 living with parents but don't rely on them for food then you don't need to report?

thank you so much

hi everyone. i have my appeal hearing scheduled for next week and i'm just wondering will i need to be on camera? also if approved will benefit be loaded the same day?"
"am i able to apply for foodstamps i applied for food stamps last year & qualified. i then was told around the summer of this year that they can no longer give me food stamps. they said since i’m living in my parents home & they’re going off of my dads income i can’t receive any. they said this has been a rule that they go off of the owners income not mine even if i pay rent. i then told the person that they never mentioned that when i first applied. he then said someone that was working probably got it wrong, something like that. then the same thing happened to my friend. they went off of her moms income & couldn’t receive any foodstamps. they said she can apply again when she turns 22. so i was pretty upset. now i am struggling with money and want to apply again. will i get denied? even if im paying for rent. i’ve heard there’s a hearing for snap. to see if it was their mistake & not yours. im just afraid to do the hearing since it was months ago that i got denied. what should i do? im a desperate mom trying to apply for food stamps"
"received two ebt cards in the mail | i keep getting transferred to my worker. hi i am in alameda county in ca i recently applied to calfresh as a student but i had to reside to my college county instead so i withdrew my application. as of today, i received two ebt cards and when i go on the benefitscal i don’t see any information about these cards. what do i do? there’s no information but the cards and my pin number

i’m in the riverside county in california. i got denied for calfresh even though i qualify through financial aid. i submitted all the needed documents when they had to interview me again. i mailed and submitted online my documents. i got denied still and i’ve been trying to contact the office. i can’t go to the office since i am back home from college and i don’t have transportation to get to the office. my worker won’t answer my calls and i tried calling the regular calfresh number and they keep transferring me to the point i get hang up or go back to my worker. what do i do? i’m basically relying on my calfresh right now."
"food stamps as college student [in] hi! i applied for food stamps and have yet to hear from them. i have been struggling lately with balancing school and work, but am very hesitant to quit my job because that is where my money for food and utilities come from which is about 400$ a month minimum. the only thing i am worried about is that i have a joint account with a substantial balance (around 20k) and even though i am a joint holder of the account, it is not my money. my mother made the account for direct deposits so it has been accumulating for about 4 years now. however it is not mine to freely use unless it’s an emergency like i couldn’t work or i had to pay for books. will they deny me based on this? i asked my on the phone and they told me they cannot say for certain. i would like to hear from others experience!"
"how to cancel benefits so i am in california. here's my story. basically my boyfriend and i share a child together (she's 10 months) him & i had some rough patches and separated in august. i had a friend stay in our apartment and split rent while ex lived with his parents. i started receiving food stamps in the end of october. him & i decided to work things back out and move back together.


i want to cancel my benefits because we will be living together and will definitely be over income limit. should i just call and explain the situation and cancel?"
"amazon $10 off $25 promotion for ebt customers | (texas) was there a recent change in the age determination of abawds? i just noticed amazon has a $10 off coupon for ebt customers on orders of $25 or more (and free shipping). the code to enter is ~~""snap1025""~~ ""snap2510"" (iirc, it'll show you the coupon code when you bring up the details for a snap eligible"" item - then be sure to enter that code at checkout and also check the free shipping option if you don't already have amazon prime)

asking for a good family member who i trust and can sympathize with.

for the last 5 years they qualified for ebt food stamps based in their age of 50+.  it was lowered from age 55 to 50 back then because people 50+ had practically no chance of getting hired within their trades or expertise, and especially thsoe with other issues. 

something *may* have changed recently (probably as a side effect of covid). and now they are, without any explanation and age 55, suddenly required to comply with twc's e&t program.. they were given 13 days to comply before their beneifits were suddenly cut off after 5 years.

they did explain within the alloted time frame to twc (texas workforce commission)  the circumstances for which they could not comply within 13 days, but their benefits were still cut off without proper review or notice. 

i've verified enough of this with twc.  using their own teirs rulebook regarding new procedures, i'm fairly confident that twc did everything correctly, just that txhhs did not review the case facts and let it default to the adverse action.

the txhhs rulebook does now say that persons under age 60 *may* be required to  comply with e&t programs (they actually make it sound the e&t programs are more *stringent*  and strict at ages 50-60, which doesn't make sense).  but there were  previous age limits of 55 and 50 according to outdated google links as recent as 3 years ago. but any new changes are totally undocumented that i can find. 

it was also mishandled according to all current procedures at txhhs.  no final notice of determination was ever generated - just benefits cut off.  no chance to appeal. 

since the cutoff age was 50+, they never had to submit documents to prove a disability.  and now that they apparently don't qualify based on age alone anymore, they were never given a chance to submit documents qualifying them otherwise, and there was never any final determination to appeal and extend benefits during the appeal.  it all happened in 13 days.

in the meantime, we have spent 4 days on hold, getting hung up on at least 6 times before we ever get to speak to anyone.  we've used the automated system to be called back when ""our spot in line"" comes up, only to called back by the system and then automatically put on hold again for 2+ hours, and then hung up on.  it literally takes 28 button presses and anywhere from 4 to 122 minutes to get hung up on

now i understand why people go physically and mentally ballistic.  if i weren't here now, this person may have likely gone into the local office armed and dangerous.  and i can certainly sympathize with that to some extent. it's no wonder why we have so many sour, bitter and violent people living in the streets that have totally given up on any government system designed to help them until after it's way too late and shit happens.

what rule changes were made in texas in the last 6 months?  and why weren't the possible beneficiaries/victims notified of anything that may affect them? 

our main concern is getting their benefits reinstated during the ""appeal period"" which has apparently expired. which will at least buy them time to scream louder and wider,"
"california food stamps - accidental fraud using benefits in other state 30+ days tl // dr: used calfresh benefits for 6 months in another state due to close family friend needing assistance after cancer diagnosis. now being investigated for fraud. rude rep on phone interview. what’s gonna happen from here?



ok so i was really stupid for not looking into the rules of ebt. i asked a friend on the phone and they said yes i could use in another state so i didn’t bother to look further into it. i know i was very wrong there. 

back in april i received a call from super nice woman in fraud investigation informing me my account was flagged and in a perfect world i would’ve notified her. i told her i wasn’t sure when i was coming back since everything was moment to moment with me even being out there in the first place aka unplanned af. 

in an emotionless world based solely off facts and rules, i can understand how she had little patience for me and assumed i intentionally committed fraud. 

i guess i’m wondering now how the investigation process goes and what to expect from here? will anything be sent to the address of my family friend? am i eligible for ebt in the state i’m in now with a ca drivers license? — out of state dl was part of the reason i didn’t apply for one out here. i wasn’t sure how the process worked with out of state dl and couldn’t get ahold of anyone at local ebt office without giving my personal info out and i didn’t want to be flagged for fraud by asking about out of state stuff. i know very little about gov benefits and i was afraid it would seem suspicious and auto flag. clearly uncle sam makes me anxious 😩🥴

thanks in advance 🙏"
"work requirements question (texas) | cancel benefits (tx) | denied food stamp renewal | caregiver question about workforce (tx) what i have read online says that if you work 30 hours a week, at federal minimum wage, or make the equivalent of that, you are exempt from having to participate in workforce. 

i work 22 hours per week at $10 an hour, which puts me above this threshold, even if it's only by a tiny bit. i turned in my change in hours which reflects this. hhs has received this paperwork and a new start date of 9-1-23 was presented afterward. 

however, workforce is telling me that i must work 30 hours a week, regardless of what i am getting paid, and must attend their meetings/trainings. i had to give cause last time because i couldn't call out to work on the day that their training was. that will always be a problem because i work in home health and during those hours 7 days a week. 

what is correct in this situation? 

does my raise in hours at my paygrade mean nothing or is it something new or am i just not understanding how all this works?

since i don't make the required 30 hours anymore at work (and they are not willing to give me more hours), how do i go about cancelling them?

::edit:: i am in tx.

i finally found a job after 2 years of just taking care of my husband at home. before now, i had his doctor fill out a form saying that i took care of him (which is true, of course) due to complications of his cancer diagnosis and surgery.

i am now working about 15 hours a week as a provider for my father in addition to taking care of my husband for no pay.

we turned in all the paperwork and got denied our renewal. after looking around, i figure it's because i don't work the 20 hour minimum...yet.

i just got approved for a few more hours with my dad. it would put it up to literally 19.5 hours per week.

is it worth reporting the change? should i try to get the form i had been using for my husband since i am still taking care of him along with this job?

last year, my husband's physician filled out a form that states that i am his main caregiver and cannot work outside the house. it took forever and a day (about 3 months) for them to accept the paper, but once they did, workforce stopped sending me letters.

that is, until yesterday. i got a notice that i am required to attend their next meeting on the 15th.

from my understanding, once the physician filled that paper out and it was accepted, that was it. i don't have anything from health and human services stating i need to fill anything else out, no additional paperwork is required.

so, what do i tell workforce when i call them on monday? should i remind them that i have this approval or do i need to have them send another paper for my husband's physician to fill out for this year?

"do i need to report missing going to the doctor for one month? hi! this might be a silly question, but i usually have $200 (sometimes more) in medical expenses per month (i'm disabled). my doctor has no openings this month, so i will be missing these payments this month. should i let them know about this or does it not really matter?

"mom lives with me and she's on fs, can i get them too? hi all, couple questions but first a little important background.
-my mother lives with my husband and i and she receives food stamps. i don't know if i am on her case or not.(but my husband for sure isnt)
-i stopped working in sept of 2022 because of an injury and i haven't been back to work since. 
-we live in clarksville, tn and my husband makes about 45,000/yr and supports himself, my mother, and i.
i have been thinking about applying for food stamps myself as well because the cost of food is astronomical and mom's stamps arnt enough. can i apply as well? what if i am on her case? will i be denied? should my husband apply instead? will he even get any making 44k?
i'm trying to think of the best way to go about this that will end in our favor cause we are struggling! i'm disabled but i don't have disability yet idk if that makes any difference.

is there any reason why i received the letter? should i disregard it? i have a case number but no case worker yet.

"can i get food stamps if i’m unemployed in georgia? | confusion after applying i’m not sure what all info is important for snap/ebt/wic so i’ll give info that i can see potentially being important. 

my bf works and i am not physically capable of working (i don’t feel like going over why i cant, just know that i can’t and i don’t have proof from a doctor because we can’t afford it) and we aren’t married but do live together along with a lot of his family members. he pays them rent, and we do not get any financial help from them, only a roof over our heads. he doesn’t make bad money but it wouldn’t be enough for us to rent anything in this state, we are lucky his family isn’t charging us too high rent. 

no one else in the house is receiving any financial help. 

i’m not sure what they look at, if they see other household members and their income and if it affects my eligibility, but on paper it just appears as though i am unemployed with no income i guess? i do also have an onlyfans but it makes me maybe $30-$70 a month on average. i stopped doing it because we only needed it while we were living in my car but people still sub even tho they can see i haven’t posted since november, but idk how long that will keep up or if it even matters. 

if there’s any other necessary info i can give i will, but that’s all i can think of that could be necessary.

i applied for food stamps in ga recently and i got a letter today that i can sign and send back to
""acknowledge receipt of dhs notice of privacy policy"".
do i need to sign and send it back or is that option because it says to sign ""if i would like to knowledge"" it says if want to, not that i need to. but if i don't does that effect anything? (only reason is i don't have stamps) and with that, i am so confused on how to find my client id to manage my account. it makes me think i don't have one yet but it's just not clear if it's hiding somewhere i can't find. all i can do is check my application status and it says ""registration complete"" and idk if that means only that i completed my online paperwork or if it means that i'm registered and ready to receive food stamps."

-will they ask for my mothers info even though i buy and prepare all my own foods? 
-was it ok to include my husband on my application even though he doesn’t have his green card yet? 
-will i be asked for proof even thought i pay my mother in cash for my rent and phone bill?

hi all. stupid question but genuinely need help 😅

"food stamp renewal discontinued so i was checking the my benefits calwin website and it says my renewal status is discontinued. is this because they're still processing my renewal form? this is for san francisco, california obvs."
"had food stamps canceled over ""not turning in proof"" when i did. i'm so mad. i walked 1.8 miles in 90 degree weather to turn in those damn forms and it looks like they just ignored them or managed to lose them. i was stupid and instead of getting a receipt like i normally do i put them in this white box designated for form return roughly a week ago because i trusted they couldn't possibly lose them.

well yesterday i got a letter saying my stamps weren't being continued because i didn't turn in proof -_- i can't call the location i turned the papers into directly for some stupid reason so now it looks like i have to walk 1.8 miles. i don't get how you lose papers from a box you have to take papers from only a few feet away from where you process them. how could i possibly prove i turned them in now?

update: well i called and after being put on hold for literally 3 hours i was told my documents were there but hadn't been processed then the guy tried to give me some bs about how i didn't include enough pay stubs in the form my boss filled out when i know it did so i ended up getting extremely upset and hanging up because despite having all my information right there he's also acting confused about what interval i get paid when on the stupid form it clearly states i get paid every two weeks. so after hanging up i had to make yet another 1.8 mile walk to the food stamp office and they told me basically my forms were still being processed because they're backed up which is understandable but i wish i had at least been informed of that instead of just being sent a letter my food stamps were being cancelled because i didn't submit proof when i know i did and now come to find out they know i did too. it just makes me so upset because i truly depend on these benefits right now. i have a lot of health issues and autism and make just enough to pay bills and not much else because i just can't physically withstand working more."

ok so applied on august 30, 2023 and today sept 28, 2023 i got a letter stating that i was approved starting in october i will get the amount stated and it will be every 14th of the month. my question is aren’t they suppose to give me for september since i applied back at the end of august?? also what is the number on my case # that i need to look at for my pick up dates thanks"
"walmart grocery pickup error? is anyone else having problems ordering walmart grocery pickup with their ebt? (i’m in oklahoma) each time i try after submitting my pin it says “something went wrong, please try again” for the last two days... we’ve only had ebt for the last month while my husband is furloughed due to covid. is this a common issue? it’s driving me nuts!"
"question about a gift my parents decided to give me a few thousand dollars as a gift, in part because they know i've been working a transitional job while i get a better one. my question is, do i have to report this gift?

and let's say i do, would it count as income for one month only? it would put me over the income limit, but just for a month. next month my income would be much lower and within snap limits.

so would it disqualify me for snap entirely or just eliminate my benefit for that month?

thanks.

edit: i'm in ohio."
"anyone else??? on temporary disabled do to surgery, having trouble getting funds from disability so i have zero income. was told i could get expedited food benefits within 7 days for nyc. had to submit everything which i did. hra app said everything was fine. had my interview everything was fine. waited my 7 days never heard anything. called hra waited two hours. to be told you’re rejected for not submitting paperwork, i was told everything was submitted from interview and on the app. a month and a half later i get mail saying i need to submit one more document before 12/2. i submitted it. my case still says rejected. app says as it always did, “we have everything we need a work will reach out if we need more”. yesterday i received record of documents from october 17. i get it they are busy but being told i’m eligible and will get expedited benefits and not getting anything but a rejection letter when everything was submitted is frustrating. i have young kids and need help! idk if my case is still open or actually rejected. when i spoke to the berry nice person from hra said they will still review my case since i submitted the last document before 12/2. this has become such a process. i just need temporary help until i can get back to work in a few month."

"applying in the state of co- a few questions | please help with my snap questions? thank you! | help with snap and roommates please! thanks i have a pretty severe health condition and i'm wondering if i would ever need to go in-person for a hearing? 

i'm planning on calling instead os using the online application because i heard it is often more effective. i'm wondering if someone might be willing to share their list of information to have ready? what i have so far is: 

information on people who list me as a dependent

what i get paid

what i have in savings/checking

what i receive as gifts/other stuff

a list of my main expenses such as rent, food, utilities, medical copays, gas but not including clothes, nonessential goods, stuff like that  


all of this information for my roommate as well who i share food with 

anything else? thank you so much!!!!

&#x200b;

my roommate and i are moving from nm to co august 21. i am posting this on august 1. we have already closed our snap and medicaid in nm. she just got medicaid started in the new state. we will be sharing food now and then.

if we both want to get snap benefits, do we each submit a separate application and list each other as household members? or do we do one application for the both of us, where one is head of household?

do snap benefits start instantly, or is there a delay period? meaning, should we apply for snap today, or on the 21st when we arrive? thank you!

when she was on the phone with medicaid, she was asked ""do you have a residence"" and we answered yes because we do have a rental there. can i just confirm that he meant our house and not ""are you a state resident?"" 

i have been on snap for years living alone. now i am moving to a new state and i will have a roommate. his income and savings might mean i am no longer eligible if i have to list him as part of my household. what do i do? how do i keep snap? thank you so much, sorry if this is a dumb question. moving from nm to co.

calfresh benefits besides food? i recently found out that you can use your ebt card to get discounted prices for participating museums in ca. is there anything else i can use my ebt card for??
"moving hi all,
i’m moving states by myself (sort of emergency separation situation, going to illinois) and am trying to look into getting things sent up there with snaps and other things before i’m able to leave at the beginning of january. right now i’m legally married and have no access to the money i make so i’m pretty much starting from scratch once i move. 
the income that i made on my own, even with access to it, i would still qualify for snap and other assistance. i’m moving in with a friend once i get there, but am trying to figure out snap. 
my former spouse made enough to disqualify us for snap here, so i’m wondering if even though i don’t have access to their finances  & unable to access even the amount i make monthly, would that disqualify me from applying? also: has anyone moved states while trying to receive benefits? if so, what were some problems that arose for you?
if you have any advice as well for receiving benefits in illinois, i’m all ears as well. thank you for your time 😊"
can i use my student loan debt to help my eligibility (nyc) i'm applying for snap benefits at the moment and almost done uploading all my documents. i feel like the numbers look more financially stable than i actually am - and i feel like that's likely because i pay \~$300 in private (sallie mae) student loans a month which can be a real kicker. can i upload a statement of my student payments as proof that i don't actually come out with a lot of extra money each month?
"appeal | college kid | college student | work study with food stamps so i was denied as an ineligible college student.. because i don’t work 20 hours of work study a week (my school only has 10 hours for me btw. no 20 hours are an option here at my university) and because i live in the dorm..(there is no off campus living here, besides houses..) im just curious how successful the appeal is? i think in my case i am going to appeal, i think i was denied for stupid reasons. also my meal plan doesn’t cover 50% of my meals and i was denied for that reason.. please let me know

hey y'all, so i have my phone interview tomorrow. will they ask if i'm on a meal plan or not? i'm in the state of in. if they do ask, what qualifies with the meal plans and what doesn't. is it 50% of meals or more is ineligible?

so as a current full time college student, my state (in) wants me to work 20 hours a week, i got work study for 10hrs a week but nothing more because that was the only one available. do they check to see if i’m working 20 hours? i heard they don’t check they just ask? please let me know if you know anything!! appreciate it

hey y'all. i was wondering if it would look better on an application if i did work study? because i'm in college or am i just wasting my time and should submit it with no income because i'm in college?"
"please please please be kind to eligibility staff. i know that systems aren’t running now and everyone is frustrated, but please make sure to be kind to your eligibility staff. we are experiencing extremely low staffing and resources across the country and are doing our best with what we have. 

please call your state representatives to complain about program rules, they are the ones who can actually work on changing them.

my benefits office has a had a huge uptick in verbal abuse from clients and it’s driving people to quit in droves. so please be considerate of the staff that are doing their best to help in trying times."
"childcare costs - school tuition is excluded? so i reapplied for benefits this month and a caseworker called. my husband and i both work, and we have our twins in a public school vpk program. the vpk voucher only covers a short while in the morning, we have to pay the school for the rest of the class time and we have to pay another separate fee for the aftercare. the caseworker told me that the tuition we pay to the school (which is almost 1,000 per month) is not considered a childcare expense and it can't be deducted from our income.

is this correct? she said that if we pulled our kids out of school and had them in a daycare, we could deduct the expenses, but because it was at an actual school that it no longer counts. we're in florida if that makes a difference. this just seems so wrong, we really need the help and i don't want to sacrifice their education to get it. i've tried researching it online but i'm not coming up with anything that addresses school specifically. please, if you happen to know anything, let me know."
"sar7 due this month but not showing up online (sacramento, ca) i got my sar7 in the mail but i prefer to just do it online since its easier and i dont have to go to the post office or catch the mail man to hand it off. but when i check my account (mybenefitscalwin) it doesnt show up as being due at all or even having a due date in the future. its all just blank and says “not due this month.” i know that we are transitioning to benefitscal at the end of next month, is this the reason that theyre not allowing online reporting forms anymore? or did they just mess up my account a little and make it to where theres no due date?"
unemployment + welfare i have welfare and my cap amount a month is 1060.00 before i have to report my income. if i'm approved for unemployment i'll receive 1600.00 a month. if i report this income it will stop or lower my benefits. my question is: do welfare and unemployment contact each other? will welfare know if i receive unemployment benefits if i don't mention it to them?
"government assistance for non-food items hi, i'm a doctor that works in a low income community in tn, and am trying to learn some of the particulars about government assistance. i often get the feeling that my patients might politely smile and nod when i ask them to get some basic thing at the store for their treatment (i.e. ""soak your foot in epson salt,"" ""try some mylanta,"" etc.)- even if they know they can't afford it.  i realize that there might be variations in the benefits people receive, but in general: 

1. can food stamps buy toiletries (toothpaste, tampons etc.?)
2. if not, how do most people on public assistance afford these?
3. can food stamps buy otc meds such as vitamins?
4. in general, is it cheaper to buy things like vitamins or tylenol over the counter than it is to get them with a prescription on medicaid? (not sure what the average medicaid co-pay is.)

i'm not trying to be funny, i really am this clueless, and this is one thing they don't teach us in med school!"
"household members in snap this is in montana btw

tldr; should roommates file together for snap benefits? if filing separate will this cause problems when applying for future household benefits?

i am working with college students to support them in joining snap, liheap, wic and medicaid. our office has been recommending roommates apply for snap individually because it can be difficult to get everyone together, most roommates do not share their incomes, and it would require sharing ssns. now comes the potential issue; when applying for liheap (support on electricity, water and heating bills/repairs) you have to declare all roommates (at least all that pay the bills and are on the lease). the declaration includes ssn and address. is it likely that individuals would be removed from snap, wic ect. if they see that multiple people live in the same houehold? has anyone experienced something like this?"
"cal-fresh / foodstamp question i am currently renting a home from a family member. i do not have a lease agreement or rental agreement. i'm in california. cal-fresh (food stamps)  has requested a lease agreement that states the amount of my rent. this family member will not provide it and refuses too, unless i pay deposit and first and last to officiate renting his home, which i've avoided because i am a single mom who's working and in college. cal-fresh rep said i would not qualify for continued benefits. do i just say i pay no rent now (even though i pay 1800 a month)?"

nh has no asset test for snap.

snap is telling me i am abawd because i don’t receive the actual ssi payments even though i am disabled and gave them the court paperwork. they also are saying even if i’m disabled i can still work.  this does not make sense to me.-  if you are disabled then you are not able bodied.

"anyone know when they add cash to bridge card? | having trouble renewing my food stamps sometimes i'll get the occasional cash benefit to my bridge card but it's not very often. i'm wondering if there's any rhyme or reason for this.

so a few weeks ago, i got a letter in the main from the state of michigan dhs. it was for ""shelter verification"". i just checked my mail about a week ago (as i don't really get any mail) and that's when i saw the letter. there were two forms i had to have filled out. one was to my landlord and the other was to my bank. i thought this would be simple but of course not.

i gave one form to my landlord and she was like ""i don't have time. i'll get it back to you when i have the chance."" needless to say, she gave it to me a few days later so it wasn't that big of a deal. my bank on the other hand told me that they don't fill said forms out at the bank and gave me a website that i had to go to - bankvod. this was not easy to figure out but basically i had to request the paperwork and they said it would take like 3 weeks. meanwhile, my paperwork is overdue.

i've tried calling the dhs office and leaving a message. i tried emailing them, etc to explain the situation and i hadn't heard anything back but now i checked my food stamps and i realized i haven't got them for the month. so that leaves me in a bit of a pickle at the moment. the office is definitely closed at the moment and i can never seem to get through to them when they are. any suggestions on what to do?"

i went to the front to ask them about it, but they made me feel a little awkward even though i was just trying to clarify where the extra $7 was coming from. they told me to come in another time and ask someone else.

the total balance does add up, but once i subtract the snap balance from it there is this gap.

"marital status change question texas i’m currently disabled receiving snap, medicare, and medicare.

how does this change affect my benefits??

i will not be gaining anything extra financially from my potential husband. i don’t know how much he makes, don’t know if he has any debts, what bills he has etc, and quite frankly i don’t want to know any of this information. i have my own set of problems and live on a fixed income for myself and myself only. i can’t take on someone else’s problems. 

are they going to take away my medicade/ medicare??
are they going to take away my food stamps??
i won’t marry if this is a threat to my livelihood. 

would i file my taxes separately?? i don’t file now bc i was told by the state i do not have to bc my disability income is under 12k and i don’t have any other income. which would remain the same if i marry.

"additional advice li ny | nothing pending? have my benefits ended? li ny | missed interview ny/li hello so i've been posting a lot here!
so about 8 or so days ago i posted about not having gotten any stamps and my recertification is pending still.

i did call back then and the person i spoke to simply told me she'd let my caseworker know. it's going to be about 2 months since i sent my recertification.

so is it just about waiting now?

i usually call around the last few days of the month to see what day i'll be getting more stamps. when i called today, april 29th, the automated system didn't say anything about when my next amount would drop.

last week i checked my recertification and it still said pending, i can't check today because apparently the website is under maintenance.

could this mean my benefits have ended? when should i apply again?

i got a letter in the mail today saying i missed my recertification interview but i was waiting the whole day, even gave my work shift away just so i wouldn't miss it. never got a call, other friends i know who have been on snap longer than me said they never get called or any such papers in the mail.

so we had our interview on december 27th, and i had our 4th child on the 28th. they made me refill out an application to add my youngest and i sent in all the paperwork within the 10 days and we waited and waited. finally around the 30 day mark, i called (this is now end of january) and was told they were still processing applications from october. we were still doing okay with one income but then in february i got hit with a massive electric bill that i just couldn't afford. i was told we don't qualify for emergency benefits but we are now going on 90 days since i applied and i keep getting told they are working on them. last i knew they were processing november's applications and that was 2 weeks ago. i know we qualify. we make over $10,000 under the ""cap"". and until i can get social security or be cleared to go back to working, we need the help.

all the websites i read say they have 30 days to respond to an application. we also applied for heap at that time and that has never been processed either. i keep going to pantries and food closets but i am now reaching my limit as we wait for taxes and watch as i have to choose what bills we pay and what we don't pay so we have money for food. we are in ny, is there anything more i can do? i call almost weekly and with no updates, i feel defeated. i don't want to lose my house, it is rent to own and i also cannot afford to be falling behind on bills."

"psa: change your ebt pin often! there's a huge increase in ebt theft through card skimming. tell everyone you know that has ebt to call the number on the back of the card and change pin. it is automatic, don't need to wait for a live person. 

change your pin before your issuance day every month is my best advice. it's okay if you forget your own pin,  just reset it again. 

if you got stolen funds, high chance you wont get the full benefit reimbursed if they stole a lot.

these fucking thieves knows your issuance date as well as the emergency allotment date. they use it the day after its issued, often in the am hours at 24hour places.  so just change pin before any issuances"

long story short, my snap ebt balance was stolen via a card skimmer. it occurred on the day my benefits were dispersed, which occurred at midnight. by 6 am the same day, my entire balance for the month was gone. i quickly discovered the theft because my transactions at the grocery store continued to get declined. 

i followed all the proper protocols for when this happens and filed out a report at the local social services office. the worker who assisted me stated that this was a genuine case of electronic theft almost certainly likely due to a card skimmer. 

on the forms i filled out it stated i could be made whole again within a certain (implied short) timeframe considering i took all the necessary steps. that was at the beginning of august, that month i lost about 10 pounds due to being unable to have adequate food intake. the date of me writing this post is october 3rd, when can i expect to receive back the benefits that were stolen at no fault of my own?*

*i believe the state is partially to blame for the recent spike of ebt theft. if it were not due to antiquated security features (or lack thereof entirely) on the ebt cards issued by the state, i believe many of the incidences today could have been prevented. 

side complaint just to get off my chest: i was given a major bout of attitude by a different county worker who said that i didn't qualify for the county food pantry option as it was only for those with extreme food insecurity and facing special circumstances. how i apparently didn't qualify as someone who's homeless, jobless, and entirely without money is beyond me that i didn't meet the criteria. i think it's abhorrent how they had me make the long trip on foot 3 days in a row in the middle of the over 100° heat wave and starving to tell me this. before it's asked, yes i had to go in person because neither my social worker will answer the phone, the operator doesn't seem to exist, and any other phone number for the county office doesn't work."
"[ca] new calfresh card is suspended, but i think i know why. does this make sense? hi -- i think i know what's happening here, but hopefully someone can let me know if whether i'm on the right track or not.

a while back i applied for calfresh, things took forever, but apparently i was approved. no card or confirmation that approval came in the mail. i only found out today when i called for the 23rd time and waited on hold again for another 45 minutes. i was stoked! they told me i could go up to my county office and pick up my snap card, so i went and got it. i logged into the account website and it showed benefit deposits for calfresh. great!

i went to test out the card, and sure enough, it didn't work. i called customer service, who told me that the card was suspended. a 💡 light 💡 went off in my head, and suddenly i remembered the weird letter i got from them a few weeks ago, saying that no one had used my account and it was being suspended. i can't find that letter now. i think i ripped it up and threw it away in a fit frustration and confusion. at the time it just pissed me off, since i didn't have a card.

apparently, they thought i already had a card. why? i've never had calfresh before. all this time, i could have been using my food stamps instead of burning hundreds of precious dollars on groceries, dollars i instead could have been using to pay my insanely high rent. we could have been actually having meals instead living on cereal and pretzels and cheap pasta for the past 6 weeks. anyhow, hopefully this is behind us.

**does this make sense, and will a quick trip back to the county office get my card re-activated tomorrow morning?**

**update -- update -- update -- update**

so i went to the county office this morning and they told me that the card wasn't suspended, and that i should go try again. i went home and logged back into [ebt.ca.gov](https://ebt.ca.gov), but nothing has changed.

i noticed something, though. for the past transactions that suspended the card (account aged  status changed, etc), it says ""card...1234"". for the recent transactions, including this morning's benefit deposit, it says ""card..."", with no last four digits. my new card number ends in 6789! that doesn't seem right...

so here's my new question: **given these findings, is it possible that they've neglected to attach my new card (the 6789 one) to my account, after suspending the old one?**

**last update -- last update -- last update -- last update**

i called them back and waited another 50 minutes on hold. **i was right!** my newly issued card wasn't attached to the case! the phone agent spent about 15 minutes fixing the account and presto -- my balance is now way more than $0! i'm so excited! with today's deposit, we now have 3 months of calfresh benefits to stock our empty kitchen with!

**for those who run into a problem like this in the future**, be sure to check the food transaction list (again, at [ebt.ca.gov](https://ebt.ca.gov)) where there are entries such as ""benefit avail"" in blue text. click on the entries to reveal another line that says ""card:..xxxx"". the xxxx is the last four digits of the card it was applied to. if you don't see a number like in my case, or you see the wrong number there, then the benefits aren't being applied to the correct card. another clue was the food balance, which read $0. once everything is linked up correctly on their end, the correct balance is shown and a few new adjustment transactions are listed, with a reference to the correct card number!

i hope this post helps someone else solve the same problem someday!

thanks again, /r/foodstamps!"
martins deli sorry if it's been asked before but i searched and didn't see. i am wondering if snap can be used at the martins grocery salad bar? you make your own salad - all items are cold. also they have like premade meals that the deli makes such as spaghetti etc i am wondering about those and the cold fried chicken etc. they also box up their left over chinese and put it in the cold section... basically just wondering what items in the deli section are covered!! thanks
"a person i know, gets child support & still has her benefits. father lives with her. why haven’t they made a case on her? does the system just not care enough? perhaps the father doesn’t live there full time? genuinely curious… i have no thoughts on ratting them out because she has a child and she’s on section 8. she doesn’t have a job so i’m assuming the father is paying everything?shit is tough for her. i’m assuming the fathers license does not have the mothers address on it, so it makes it seem like its not a red flag or he’s at work all the time. i did ask her how does that happen and she says it’s because a lot do people do it. 

kind of makes me feel iffy about it all but again life is tough and i’m sure the workers are underemployed and just tired of the system. she would get in major trouble for something like this so i’m not sure why she would risk so much. i’m pretty sure she has no backup plan. given that she’s already on section 8 & has zero family in her state."
"az snap & when to report income change? my husband got a new job on july 24th. not sure when he will get paid for the first time.    i know his new job will disqualify us from benefits, i was hoping to get at least benefits for august too.

when do i call az des and tell them about his job and to stop receiving benefits? 

is it ten days after he gets a job? or ten days after his first paycheck? or is it august 10? (last one is how i interpret their website… i’ll post a screenshot?)"
"irt confusion (calfresh) | calfresh... should we have received an update by now? hey all, so i'm kinda confused about reporting when going over the irt. so i have a weekly paying job, i started work on feb 6. now the work you do one week isn't paid until the following friday. so for example, i started work on the 7th this month, but wasn't paid for the week until the 17th. now i have worked three weeks and received two paychecks this month. i'm getting my third this friday but it'll be march by then. does what i get this friday count as income for february (did work the week starting the 20th) because if so, my household went over the irt. hope this makes sense because i'm pretty confused lol.

san mateo county btw

hey all, so during the month of march, my new job plus the income for my mom's ssi put us over our irt. now i called the county to ask which website to use to upload my pay statements and the person on the line said either works (getcalfresh or benefitscalwin), so i uploaded to benefitscalwin. my mom had me log into her account to upload the documents bc i'm on her case. but since the county already knew how much my mom gets from ssi per month, i was told by the worker that i just need to upload my documents. so on the website, i went to the documents tab, then hit upload, uploaded my pay statements and clicked upload. it's showing received. but that was almost three weeks ago on the 10th, should we have gotten any update because i keep logging in to see any changes but nothing. san mateo county."
cal fresh: mom had interview today for recertification. they never called. does she need to do anything? they kept sending reminders for the day and time for an appointment but it’s been hours and they have not called.
"nyc expedited food stamps...? i received a phone call today from hra interviewing me for food stamps and cash assistance... she told i was approved for expedited food stamps, however she said i wouldn't be able to pick up my card because the offices are closed. she referred me to 311 to see how i could obtain a card... they had no idea. anyone else run into this issue?"
"number for that handles sanctioned accounts directly in texas? i need help in getting contact with the department that handles sanctioned accounts directly in texas.

my account got sanctioned back in april after failing to report to the health and human services commission i didnt have a job. when i originally applied i was unemployed however 2 weeks after i had gotten a job and was to report this to workforce in which i did. what i failed to realize was i was also to report this to the ebt department after thinking the workforce was gonna do it ( my mistake ) and didn't know about it until a month after in april ( i had just moved and was slow to report a change in address so i never got the letter telling me )

regardless after finding out i was told to call up the workforce and tell them of the situation since they were the ones who sanctioned my account.
however after it being sanctioned for over a month ( didnt find out until mid may ) the counselor that oversees sanctioned said she couldn't do anything but gave me a number to a department in austin that can overturn it.
after calling the number which is 512-231-5701
turns out it was a dead number.

i figured i might have heard her wrong when writing down the number. however it's like after that she's always unavailable now. after 2 weeks of non stop calling and going in person to talk i had frustratingly gave up as i was getting nowhere.

faster forward to now, august is half way over, money is tight and with food prices how they are now i could really use my benefits again

another question is how long is my account gonna be sanctioned for since this is my first time and when can i reapply?"
"time limits? 3 months limit in 36 months? i've been on foodstamps most of my adult life and only just read about this. what states is this still a thing? hi, so i moved states once before in a car and i was on foodstamps at some point in that state, and they never mentioned a time limit, they just kept giving me snap money as long as i was under the irt and i moved back to my original state and got on it again, but they also never have mentioned a time limit.

i plan to be moving again sometime soon and move back into my vehicle once i get it fixed, but i need to know what kind of support there is in which states. i plan to eventually grow and produce my own food but it makes it difficult because i will not be moving to somewhere with many job opportunities and will be working online. the state to which i am moving soon is alaska. i've spent most of my life in california and washington.

it would be ideal if alaska was similar to california in the sense that they don't really demand that you join a work program or limit you at all, this frees me up to spend time on self-education and working on my own businesses that may or may not be viable sources of income."
"food stamps approved but denied? so i was checking my case because it was strangely requested we submit employment verification and paystubs for my husband the whole time hes been employed on 1/19 said due 2/2. which strange dates as is. 

so i was looking because we dont always get mail. no new mail. 

but my case says approved. but when i go look at it it says denied, ed0120 for reason. ammount recouped and ammount given this month? ...i am very confused? i give them paystubs every month because they said anything over 100$ difference needs to be reported. which my husbands paystubs flex very often. 

i live in north dakota. but now i cant view any of my previous mail as it says theres an error as well.... ill call monday. they said they had everything. but im so confused."

wasn’t sure with my situation if i would qualify for benefits since because of no income but am technically working. also unsure if to apply now with my new address ahead of time or to wait. i have a lease agreement signed for proof of residency but no util bills cause they’re included in my rent/in landlord name. i do have to pay for internet but don’t have a bill generated for some time.

"she cancelled our fs even though we did the review. hey so i live in ga and i had a review, i did the review before the deadline, and then they asked me to send in my husbands paystubs, i do that. lady calls and tells me they are too blurry to send in clearer images. it takes me 2 days to do this. she closed my case the same day she’d called me, she’d called at 3pm friday. is there anything i can do about this?"
"dss/snap claiming my income is double what it is hello, i am self employed and on ssdi, and i get snap in ct.when i did a recent income verification i sent in my 2022 tax return.

i recently got some paperwork from dss about the snap increase, and in the letter they are saying my income is xxx (2x what it is). i looked and the figure they are referencing is from my schedule c - business income, called ""gross income"". (schedule c line 7).

again, this number is pulled from my schedule c - profit or loss. by using that gross income figure they are not taking into account any of my itemized business deductions listed in detail below that line.i spend business expenses / deductions to run the business and that money is not mine.

everyone i know, knows that business income = gross business income - expenses.

edited to add: ""gross adjusted income"" is form 1040, line 11 and that is the correct number.

unfortunately we aren't assigned ""caseworkers"" here, and calling is not so much of an option (5 hour wait).   
**==> is it customary for this to happen / are business deductions not allowed?** this is actually not the first time business deductions were denied even though itemized, but this is my tax return this time, that's as official as it gets. any advice is appreciated."

"income limits why do they go based on gross income instead of the net? they say i make too much for my family of 5 but my utilities and house payment are over what my net monthly income is. do they not take into consideration what you are left with after paying the utilities and housing? i don't keep the taxes so why use that as part of the income?

"i recieved my cash assistance deposit today but i haven't recieved my foodstamps deposit | is there a schedule for heap deposits, or are they put on your card randomly? my foodstamps & cash assistance come in at the same time for the first deposit of the month. today i received my cash assistance deposit on my card but i haven't received any food stamps deposit nor do i see it pending. i was able to see my cash assistance pending two days prior to today & it's on my card.

"nyc hra - food stamp recertification application mistake. will it get me into crazy trouble? i got approved for snap last year but didn’t notice it immediately which happened to another person i know because that person never received a card. i never had to do an interview, nothing was communicated to me, so i thought it was just a lost cause. i received a card months later in the mail (out of nowhere) and used it once or twice but i started a job. i tried to cancel snap but every single time i called, the wait time was crazy. i really stood on the phone for 3 hours and gave up or the automation literally hung up on me occasionally around 30 mins in saying to try calling again another time. this also happened to the other person i mentioned.

there was no way to cancel it on the app so i ignored it and mistakenly assumed the card would be open but the money expires and can’t be used. some months later, i was laid off this job and needed assistance. the snap card had a collected balance on it so i used it and it worked.

now, the office is asking me to recertify the benefits and so i did but i made 2 errors?

* i said i received unemployment benefits which i was being honest but i messed up by not cancelling when i had a job for those said months i worked. i’ll admit my error here. i got frustrated with the constant waiting and being hung up on so i gave up because i didn't have the time and effort.
* i put that i’m disabled and they’re asking for a letter/proof. i work remote due to a health condition but i never thought about going to a doctor to get any official note for it because nobody ever asked for such a thing.

can i explain this to a case worker or is there serious penalization for this? i'd obviously pay back what i used while i was working. i’m having serious anxiety because i had a nightmare experience trying to cancel, i don’t even know if recertifying will be any more easy. i understand that nyc agencies are backed up but i don’t want to get in trouble for my mistakes and i really need the help. i’ve been job hunting for nearly 6 months with no leads and that’s been a nightmare. the unemployment benefits didn’t cover my rent fully either."
"question on my food stamps status. | applied for foodstamps april 20th still haven't heard back i've been waiting 83 days and checking on my status daily. finally today it says ""reviewed"" so i went and checked and it says my food stamps was denied.  but it also shows a food stamps card say ""active"" even though it doesn't have a balance.  i still haven't received a letter or text message saying they have denied me so i'm wondering if they are still reviewing or if once it says denied if it's final? i never got an interview and i applied back in april.  we need this and i don't know what to do.

i applied april 20th here in texas, called for an update may 21st and they said i would be bumped up to priority,  called again in june and they said they are still behind with so many applications and i have to just be patient.  have any of you waited this long? over 2 months now."
"i have just been approved for snap benefits. i have a couple questions first, how do i report that i am looking for a job? i said when i applied i'm the notes section that i have currently put in around 8 applications for work for places near me, and was waiting on calls back or emails. on the followup phone call with the nice lady, i asked her how i report if i'm looking for a job since i saw there were work requirements and she said ""oh, you don't"". i was confused because i have to be looking for work in order to be applicable, but there's no way to report it, i asked how am i supposed to follow the guidelines and she said ""you just need to call and tell us when you accept a job offer"". i got the approved mail a little bit ago (got the card yesterday) and it's saying i have to follow the work requirements like trying to find a job and if i don't follow the requirements i can lose benefits, and i'm just kind of anxiety panicking because its not saying anywhere a place i can report the info too like an email or anything. i'm just worried because i don't want to do anything wrong but i'm not finding a place i can say ""i've applied for such and such job"" or ""i've been interviewed at this location"". i've tried calling but i've always been on hold for over an hour before the line just drops. i just want to do things correctly and i'm worrying and panicking because i don't know what or how to do.

my secind question, what's a good list for buying things with snap? like, i keep just seeing ""take a look at your pantry and see what you don't have"" or ""here are the things you can and can't buy"", i just want a list of like ""here's what i bought that got me through my foodstamps time"" or ""this is what i recommend you buy"", i just don't want to make a mistake and i know if i just try to ""get what i don't have"" i'm afraid i'll get something that isn't going to be touched, or i'll just mess up somewhere and make a mistake, i just want a guideline to follow and stuff, ""this much meat"", ""this much rice/pasta/beans"", ""this much veggies""

sorry if these get asked a lot, i spent the last three hours trying to look this stuff up and just got overwhelmed when it was the same ""here are the work guidelines"" or ""here's what can and can't be bought"" over and over and over. i don't care if kansas can buy cigarettes or people are campaigning for energy drinks, i just want to know how much chicken i need to buy😭"
"inactivity but never received card | income reporting with job ending i recently (re) applied for food stamps and it took a while to get my card so i called and was told they sent me a card in dec 2021 but i have no clue where that went bc i never got it and i check my mail religiously.

"[nj] the system says i completed my recertification, when. my benefits were not deposited. (new jersey) the system says i completed my recertification interview when i did not. my benefits are late.

i’m living in *nj* and i got a letter for re certification in march 2023. i missed the call due to a medical reason. when i called the county to reschedule the woman that answered the phone said that when she looked up my information that the interview process said “complete”. i told her i did not complete the over the phone interview and she wouldn’t reschedule me. i called back later on that day and the next person i spoke to said that i will receive a letter of what the next steps are after missing an appointment.

about a week later i received a letter in the mail stating i missed my phone appointment it said, i need to call the county line to reschedule my phone interview or my benefits would terminate at the end of april.

i called back the next day to reschedule and i was told yet again that the system said i completed everything i needed to do and that i did not need to do anything. i explained that i missed my phone appointment in march and received a letter stating i missed my appointment, and again i was told that it said completed in the system.

i received benefits from nov-april. each month except november my fs balance was deposited on the 3rd. i did not receive benefits yesterday (may 3rd).

how do i find out about the status? i do not have a case worker or an extension other than the regular hotline on the back of the card and the county board of social services.

obviously, i am not doing well with phone calls. i’m wondering if i should go down to the office tomorrow morning rather than calling.

i have received my fs every month of the 3rd since december 2022.  

is there anyway to check status or pending deposit? does anyone know if the providers app or connectebt.com shows pending deposits for fs?

any help is greatly appreciated."
"[florida] i missed my recertification date and just re-submitted a new application | update! everything went smoothly! [florida] see above, in florida. i missed my benefit renewal date- sadly, this is a case of 'i barely got notification', even by way of e-mail.  


as of finally having the time to get back in to recertify, i basically had to write-up a whole new application because it... apparently didn't seem to keep my info? i submitted it a day or two ago.  


as of checking today, my application (since it's apparently just a plain application now) says 'pended', and my history of benefits and such has vanished. i am worried and concerned. can anyone input on this to allay my fears? i'm starting to panic just a bit.

so, a few days ago, i posted here on the foodstamps subreddit, expressing, for lack of a better phrase, my downright terror of pulling out my ebt card, upon which several of you kindly encouraged me that there should be no reason to be so worried or paranoid.  


i am happy to report, that you were right. my fears were unfounded. i just got back from the grocery store (with my mother in tow, because she's kind enough to drive me places when i need from my apartment), and nothing went wrong at all. i pulled it out, nobody looked at me with the evil eye. nobody whatsoever made any snide remarks, and the cashier and bagger were both very, very patient with me and compassionate. i admit, i wear oxygen and, even being young i do.. well.. look disabled, even physically due to my lung issues, but...  i just pulled out the card, and swiped it. it worked like magic.  


i'm so happy now. i have no reason to worry. my groceries are taken care of every month now. i no longer have to worry about losing my grocery budget in case a medical emergency came up.  
my pantry and fridge are full. i will be able to sleep so well tonight knowing that i no longer have to worry about feeding myself.  


thank y'all for reassuring me <3"
"using snap benefits after not qualifying anymore. will be renewing our application for snap benefits in new mexico soon.

however, there is a possibility we will not qualify for this next cycle since my post-grad schooling doesn't count as ""full time"" and my wife is not working but currently looking for a job. that being said, we still have quite a few funds on our card.

if we do not qualify here in nm, will we still be able to use what is left on our card?"

from what i saw, there for students who were affected by covid. but like... it's 2023? 

i did just barely start getting free lunches, so i'm sure that's why it was sent. but what does that have to do with the pandemic?

can anyone explain what this card is, and why i just now received it lol

thanks!!"
"how to cancel snap application mo my circumstances just changed, and i'd rather just cancel the application i just submitted and wait a few days to submit another application than wait to probably be denied first. i tried looking up how to cancel my application and just got lots of articles saying yes, i am allowed to do that. i can't find any way to do it on the fsd website. is there any way to do it online? if not, what number do i have to call?"
"rant - please be kind to your worker i’m a tanf/snap worker, meaning i give out cash aid and food stamps. i want to grant/authorize your case. i’d love to be able to load benefits on to your card today so you can go to the grocery store or pay your rent. but sometimes i can’t. we have to adhere to the federal rules and regulations. if you have not turned in all the necessary documents, i cannot do anything to “turn on your case” without being called in by program integrity. so please don’t yell at me because “i’m not helping you.” 

“so if i turn it in today, will i get it today?” ordinarily i would tell you yes, but we have been inundated with new cases. i cannot promise you i’ll get back to your case today. i explain to people, “i process paperwork in the order in which it is received. so if 10 people turn in paperwork before you, then yours is the 11th case i work on.” do not respond to me by yelling about how long you’ve waited for an appointment. that is beyond my control. ordinarily in my office we have 18 intake workers. today we had 6. it’s not my fault we can no longer do 72 appts a day. today we are doing 24, because you cannot force 6 people to do 18 people’s worth of work. (the union had to step in because us 6 were doing 18 people’s worth of work.)

i’m your intake worker, i approve or deny your case. state guidelines say i have 45 days to approve/deny your case. do you really think yelling at me is going to push your case to the top of the pile?"
"cash assistance sent to wrong management company (new york) 
my mother went in january to apply for cash assistance because she became disabled. she was approved and was given help filling out the application in person. the address stated is incorrect and has the same name as her management company but isn't it. she was never asked the address, was just asked for a breakdown of her rent which she provided and it has the correct address up top. has this ever happened to anyone else? is there anything that can be done?"
what changes did biden make to ebt? i heard that they are about to be really difficult to receive.
"grandmother my grandmother moved in with my family of 5 two years ago because no one else could take her in. with what my fiancé and i were making, along with grandma’s funds, we were living comfortably. recently, i’ve had to stop working to deal with doctor appointments between my grandmother, my adhd/odd son, and my newly diagnosed level ii autistic son. not to mention my adhd/odd son gets in trouble at school constantly, so we get phone calls to pick him up for removals/suspensions from school. throw running in errands, and i feel like i am working a full time job.

anyway, with only my fiancé working and grandma’s social security and pension coming in with a household of 6, we’ve decided to look into applying for food stamps to help ease the burden of grocery costs in our budget. food has become so expensive since the covid outbreak, plus i got two boys going through puberty. my question is do i have to count my grandmother? counting her social security and pension wouldn’t give us much in food stamps to go through the hassle of applying, but counting just my fiancé’s income would be worth it. we live in ohio.

to add, we have started the process of applying for ssi for our autistic son, but it’s a process that’ll take a few months to be approved from what i’ve heard."
"nys p-ebt | ny - a mistake on additional benefits? hi i have a question about p-ebt. this month i noticed i received $391 for each one of my sons. i checked the website and it's a little confusing. it sates: ""p-ebt food benefits for children whose parents/guardians submit a nys p-ebt food benefit application, and who are determined eligible, will be issued on a rolling basis beginning may 15, 2023, through september 29, 2023.""

&#x200b;

i'm confused. i never applied i got it automatically, is that because i already receive benefits? do we get it every month until september or was it just a one time thing? the website has so much stuff on it and it's confusing. thanks. 

[nys p-ebt website](https://otda.ny.gov/snap-covid-19/frequently-asked-questions-pandemic-ebt.asp)

so i called to check my balance today and it had some crazy amounts pending that will be available tomorrow. 

7 payments of $132
2 payments of $214
and one payment of $82

i have been receiving benefits for a long time and do a recert every 6 months (last time being february). my family consists of 3, two children and myself. 

i called and left a message to my caseworker but they take forever to get back to you. i was wondering if this happened to anyone else or if it is addition benefits like they did previous months? but it can’t be right, that number is just too large."
"illinois: interview scheduled. is there anything i need to know? | illinois: vehicle i've had snap for the last two years.  i'm worried they're going to think i'm trying to game them or something because i literally was raised by a narcissist mom and i always have a guilty conscience even when i didn't do anything wrong.

i was self employed before the pandemic and received pua.  i've been unemployed (no income other than selling a few things on ebay for the last two years.

i live with my parents (super stressful) but we don't prepare meals or anything together.

what should i know not say/say during the interview?  it says on my message that i can call the office before the interview date and do the interview rather than waiting for them to call.  is that true?

a few years ago my dad sold me an old car.  it's got a street value of about $1,000.

this information is not in my file.  i am filling out the application to continue benefits and it says no one in my household has a car.

i googled vehicle food stamps illinois and it says the car has to be valued at less than $4,000 or so.

when did this become a rule and why?

anyway, will i get in trouble for getting food stamps last year with a vehicle i did not declare?  i'm sure i declared it, i did the phone interview and i wouldn't have said i don't have a car.

if i put that i got my vehicle in 2021, which i did, will that  backdate my benefits and make me ineligible for the benefits i got last year?

should i just leave it off since it's not there anyway?

this is concerning to me."
"ohio being sus.... okay so it said ohio is getting their final emergency allotment on feb 28th. neither i nor my partner have gotten ours. i've tried calling ohio benefits and i've been on the phone for 20 minutes.

"income reporting | spent more than remaining snap balance question i am in california.

i just started doordashing and i have went over the irt of $1383.  doordash pays weekly.  i try calling my worker but have not got a return phone call and its been a few days.  i  try calling the number for my countys calfresh/snap program to report it that's provided but all i get is ""due to high call volume we can not take your call right now""

i try to report online but it asks how many hours i work and how much i will make a month/week/etc but with doordash its not that simple as some days i might work and some days i might not so the hours and wages are never the same amount weekly/monthly...  so i don't know what numbers to put in.  and also i cant download my banks transaction history until the month is over.  i can only download last months so if they ask for that i don't know how i am supposed to provide it except for just telling them the amount's deposited on what days.

they say i must report within 10 days going over the limit but they sure make it hard to do so...  what happens if it takes me longer then 10 days?  i have already been trying to call for the last three days but get the same nonsense and all the offices are closed for in person and my worker has not return called after my message i left her.

also there is still two more weekly payments left for this month so once i report this am i expected to report again every payment after i go over the irt amount?

i am in california.

i had $88.03 left on my snap balance and i went grocery shopping and spent $112.21.

i thought it would charge only up to the $88.03 remaining snap balance and ask me to pay the remainder in cash/creditcard/etc but it somehow paid the whole thing and even says now i have $65.82 remaining snap balance?

i read something about calfresh snap emergency allotments for $95 but i already had the maximum amount for my household size of one for $234 month.

i did the math and added $95 to my $88.03 remaining balance from my last receipt and subtracted the $112.21 and it comes to exactly the amount it says i have remaining now of $65.82 so i guess you do get the $95 emergency allotment even if you already had the maximum monthly amount for your household size. is that what's going on here i guess so?"
"can i use my remaining balance if my calfresh was discontinued? hello everyone, i recently reported my change in income and my benefits were discontinued.   
i still have a few hundred left on my calfresh balance though.   
is it still okay to use the remaining balance?  
my girlfriend just put a down payment on our own place so every little bit helps."
"nyc - snap cancelled without notice...again. i'll try to make this brief and generally am wondering if anyone else went through this and what you did about it.

my father got ebt a little after he turned 62 (he is 66 now). he is within the maximum income allowed, has no additional earnings or assets, and his paychecks have not changed or increased since then (he is not on ssi and has no pension). last year after his recertification he got a notice that he was being denied the continuation of his benefits. he appealed and got them reinstated because there was no reason for them to be taken away in the first place.

this year it seemed to have happened again. he recertified about a month ago except this time instead of getting a notice they simply didn't send him food stamps to his ebt card. sometimes they're late and my dad waited but 2 weeks in (his deposit date is the 3rd) and nothing so he checked online and his case just says closed. no warning, no explanation, nothing.

we have been calling every day, staying on hold for literal hours at a time, and can't get through to a human being. he needs those food stamps, even with them the inflation in nyc is so bad it's not enough to last him through the month so without them he'll legitimately starve.

has this happened to any of you? did you get an explanation? were you able to eventually get through to their office, and if so, how did the situation end? thanks in advance, happy holidays all."
"does ca ebt mandatory put the father on child support if the mother is receiving benefits? i’m just curious if anyone has experienced this situation. nothing was ever asked and i never got an interview but i’m wondering if they peruse the father for child support? and if so, when? i’ve been on it for 2 months now and nothing has come up, i’m not sure if i should inform him of this. nobody has reached out from the county either."

"colorado ebt case under review for 60+ days? i applied for snap assistance in colorado on 5/05/2023, and my case still says under review. i called twice and both times the representative told me to just wait. i have been homeless and jobless for over a decade, have not had a single government aid in these ten years nor prior either. i do not understand what is taking so long, especially when my case is so clear cut. has my time spent living under the radar made it difficult to process my case? being told to wait longer is increasingly frustrating when you're hungry. in ten years of homelessness and joblessness, this is the first time i have applied for something like this, so you can imagine how hungry i am currently. hopefully i'll actually be alive by the time they review my case."
"my wallet with ebt was stolen while moving in the midst of moving from one state where i was receiving snap benefits to another, my wallet and ebt card was stolen. 

i no longer have an address in the state i moved from but was able to freeze my card. how do i get a new card to go to my new address/state with my remaining benefits from the old state? i still had a few hundred bucks on it. 

i know they only would send official mail to my ebt state address but i am worried my previous landlords will trash anything of mine that is delivered there now that i’m gone (yea, those kind of landlords). also, apparently mail forwarding doesn’t work because it’s required to have an address in the state. 

idk if this makes any sense - i am not trying to get additional benefits from old state while living in new state — just want the balance of the unused benefits from old state.

california ebt emergency allotment not received hello. i am wondering if anyone else is having issue with their california ebt emergency allotment. i believe we were supposed to get it today but i woke up and the benefits had not been added. that has never happened before. i always get the emergency allotment on the date they say it should be available.  anyone else having this issue today? anyone have any info or experience on this?
do you sometimes feel guilty for being on assistance? i do sometimes but for the most part im chillin.

"(fl) how do i accurately report child support income if the amount is inconsistent? hi y'all!

so my 2 children and i currently receive snap and medicaid, and i finally began receiving child support on the 1st of this month. their dad is ordered to pay $110/week but we're only 2 payments in and he's already lagging behind. so far i have received $102 and $63, and it is likely that payments will continue to be inconsistent if they keep coming at all. i need to report the change in income for my case but i'm not sure what i should put since the ordered amount deviates from reality.

any help would be appreciated!"
"any advice on tracking transactions in nys? i live in ny state (not nyc). i've been using the android app ""providers"" for a while now. it's been very helpful for keeping track of my balance.

in march, i ran out of food stamps for the first time. i was surprised so i looked at my history. it didn't show any deposits for january or february. it showed the deposit for march, just not for january or february.

i'm disabled and have a care coordinator. she tried for almost a *month* to call the local dss office and try to find out what happened. she'd be on hold for two hours and still never even get a human being (like not even switchboard, *nothing*).

finally, last week, i went into the office myself. i was able to access a person really quickly, there wasn't even a line, so i don't know why they just choose not to answer their phones. but anyway, the person i saw told me that according to their system, i *did* get my deposits in those two months.

she said if i wanted a printout of the transactions for those months, i would have to contact the 'team' that handles my case, and she gave me their phone number and email address. since she was looking at the transactions on her screen, i don't know why she couldn't just print them for me right then, but okay, i guess i'll jump through more hoops to get my info.

today was my deposit day, so i looked at providers to see if my deposit came in. it did. however, now it's showing no deposit for march or april! even though i definitely *did* get my stamps for those months. so now i'm not sure whether providers is a reliable way to track this info anymore. 

i wish the state would have its own app or even a website i could log into and see my transaction history, the same way you do with a bank account. you'd think it would be in their best interest to give us an easy way to make sure there's no unauthorized use of our card, if they care so much about fraud...

does anyone have recommendations on a reliable service i can use for this in new york state?

"was approved for calfresh ebt two months ago but still haven’t gotten an ebt card??? hi,

i had my calfresh interview in january and was told to email my proof of income so i did — in february i received a letter verifying that i was approved for ebt food stamp benefits but after that i never got an actual ebt card.

i received another letter in march that showed i was receiving ebt benefits and it said that i needed to update my info if my income increased, but that i didn’t need to do so until my next sar 7 or recertification.

i’m confused because i still haven’t used any calfresh benefits yet since i still don’t have my ebt card. i’ve been waiting this whole time because i figured things were really slow with the pandemic but i’m now worried that my card was sent to someone else or something.

i’ve called and emailed the calfresh contact numbers but haven’t heard anything back yet. i’ll keep trying, but i’m wondering if this happened to anyone else?"
"can't qualify for food stamps because of student loans | money from student loans in my account? i have around $10k in student loans lying in my bank account. i'm in graduate school. i was denied because in my state(ar) i am not supposed to have more than $2k in cash or bank account. but on the application there is nowhere i can indicate that is debt money. is there anything i can do about this?

i go to graduate school and took out a substantial student loan of 10k for living expense purpose on top of tuition. the feds just raised interest rates again and i'm really trying to graduate with least debt as possible so i've been looking to apply for food stamps. in my state i'm not suppose to have more than $2,250 in my bank account if i want to qualify for snap. in my application should i get some sort of ""proof of debt"" attached? how should i go about this?"
"my ex is applying for food stamps, will this put me on child support (oklahoma) my ex and i have a 2 year old together, however we’ve been separated since she was 6 months old, since then i’ve been paying her around 100$ every paycheck every 2 weeks to help out with our daughters needs. i’ve also been picking her up our child and shes been staying the night with me on my days off. my ex and her new man just had another child together and decided to go for food stamps and she told me that something with child support is being looked at. i have all the records of money i’ve been sending her, we have nothing legal going between us, but with her doing this, will i have to be put on actual child support?


edit: 
i do wanna thank all of those who responded and informed me, with how often my ex has our child, and what she may be trying to push for i think the best option here is to end up fighting it and trying to get custody of my child, because there’s is no sensible reason for her to need child support nor foodstamps if she only has our daughter usually 1 and maybe 2 days out of the week. 
i’ve gotten mixed answers some saying it’s only if she asked for cash assistance, or tanf, and others saying it’s gonna happen regardless so either way i’ll just have to ride it out and see what goes. 
again thank you for the continued responses and information and sharing your stories along too."
can i apply for food stamps for just myself? i’m 25 and work a part time job while living with my mom and her boyfriend. they both receive disability. when she applied for food stamps she said i was unemployed (which was true at the time) and was told her and her boyfriend make too much money for a household of 3 to get food stamps. they aren’t able to buy me food and i’m really struggling to feed myself on about $200 a week with all my other bills. can i apply for food stamps for just me? if it helps i live in indiana.
"possible scam?? i posted in another sub, but thought maybe someone here may know. i received several calls today stating that a complaint has been made against me and that my ssn has a chance of being suspended due to taxes. i do not receive social security nor does anyone in my family. we do receive medicaid and snap benefits, however. i've tried contacting my local fsd, but keep getting the automated runaround. does anyone here know where i can report this scam? i'm in southwest missouri."
"food stamp recipients: this is a reminder that your temporarily increased benefits should not be used to pay back a previous snap overpayment claim | possible changes to snap/food stamps under the heroes act | ysk papa murphy's generally accepts ebt because it is not technically ""pre-prepared"" | what does the new food stamp rule about work requirements mean for the program? | snap update 1/25/19 - what does the end of the govt. shutdown mean for food stamps? | new report: barriers to eating healthy on snap | update: automod will now prompt op to provide a state when none is detected in the post title. | do we have any workers from il or fl lurking on the sub? the usda/fns that oversees the food stamp program [released guidance on may 20, 2021](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/ea%20qas_5_20_2021_final.pdf#page=2), that clearly states that your increased emergency benefits should **not** be used to pay back an overpayment claim for non-emergency benefits. 

> can state agencies use ea to offset a snap overpayment claim? 
> response: no. over-issuances of snap benefits cannot be collected from ea.

that means if your state is taking part or all of your increased emergency benefits (this is apart from your 'normal' benefit allotment), they are in violation of federal guidance. let us know if this is happening to you. 

e.g. normally you would be approved for $100 in snap, but with the emergency increase you're receiving the maximum $234 per month. you had a previous overpayment claim against you, and the state is taking over $100 per month from you (even as much as the full $234). 

this is wrong because $100 was your normal allotment and now they are dipping into your emergency allotments by taking more than $100/month.

the house introduced the heroes act today which may include the following changes to snap (**note**: this bill has **not** cleared the senate and gone to the president so none of these provisions are currently in effect):

* increases the snap maximum benefit by household size by 15%, beginning in june 2020 through september 2021 (due to how snap is calculated from the maximum benefit, all households would effectively receive a benefit increase)
* increases the snap minimum benefit from $16 to $30
* suspends snap time limits for abawds and work requirement sanctions for 2 years.
* provides $150 million to supplement snap state administrative funding for fy20 and fy21
* block grant for puerto rico and american samoa would be increased by 15% in fy20 and fy21.

i had a discussion about this with a user in a different thread and thought it was worth posting. 

> q. oh snap! do you accept ebt?

> a. yes, we do! the majority of our independently owned franchises are set up to accept ebt as a form of in-store payment. currently, like most retailers, we are unable to accept ebt for online purchases, but we hope this program expands so that it's an option in the future.

hey everyone,

you've likely heard that there's a new final rule regarding work requirements for the food stamp program that is slated to go into effect in april 2020. i'm here to tell you what that means for the program.

first, here's [the usda's press release on the rule](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-120419). 

**what the rule changes**

some food stamp participants (able bodied adults without dependents) must work 20 hours/week to receive benefits. states have been able to waive the work requirement in areas (e.g. regions, counties) for reasons like high unemployment. this helps people stay on the program during economic downturns. during the recession, every state but one waived work requirements in at least part of the state. 

the new rule:

1. only allows states to waive work requirements if unemployment is at least 6%, *and* is 20% higher than the national average. this is a higher standard than before.

2. no longer allows states to waive the work requirement based on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. states must rely on historical unemployment data, which can take a little longer to acquire. 

**who the rule affects**

anti-poverty groups estimate that about [700,000 people will lose program benefits](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/new-snap-rule-would-cost-many-of-nations-poorest-their-food-aid) because of the new changes (some areas will no longer be eligible for the waiver, and so the work requirements will kick that many people off the program). the usda estimates that this will save about $1 billion per year (the program currently costs about $65 billion annually). 

**what happens now**

as i mentioned, the rule is slated to go into effect in april 2020. what's likely, however, is that the usda will be sued by anti-poverty organizations, which will delay rule implementation while the courts determine whether the rule is legal. 

we recommend checking back in march 2020 to see whether the rule will go into effect. if it does, and you're in an area with waived work requirements, check with your state agency to determine whether you'll be affected by the change. 

please let us know if you have any questions. thank you!

hey y'all,

~~i'm speculating without any direct guidance from fns, but based on what we saw recently, here's what i believe the end of the government shutdown means for the program for the next few months~~:

edit 1/28/19 @ 4:30 est: i was able to confirm via fns that the following information is true. fns is also concerned about the 40+ lag in benefits for some participants and is weighing possible options.

edit 1/31/19 @ 9:30 est: q&a from fns: https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/snap/snapfacts1-29-19.pdf

* the three week continuing resolution (cr) ends on february 15

* all february benefits are guaranteed (ongoing cases should have received theirs as early issuance in january-- **households that received early issuance will not receive more benefits in february without some sort of fns intervention**)

* this means that any financial obligations owed by the government (such as food stamp benefits and admin dollars) can be paid out for the 30 days following the (cr), or until **march 17, 2019**

* therefore, march food stamp benefits should be guaranteed and paid out as normal

* ~~if there is *another* government shutdown following this cr, then april benefits could be paid out by march 15 as early issuance~~ another shutdown was averted and an appropriations bill was passed that is good through the rest of the federal fiscal year (until october 2019).

**upshot** ~~i believe fns will confirm next week that~~ march/april benefits will be guaranteed for ongoing cases and recertifications that are processed before march 15

a new united states department of agriculture (udsa) study identifies the barriers that snap participants face when trying to achieve a healthy diet through a nationally representative survey of snap participants. the study is available [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/barriers-constrain-adequacy-snap-allotments) but i'm including the top level talking points:

1. overall, 88 percent of snap participants
reported facing some type of barrier to
achieving a healthy diet throughout the month. 

2. the most common barrier overall, reported by
61 percent of snap participants, was the
affordability of foods that are part of a healthy
diet.

3. other environmental barriers, reported by
nearly 20 percent of participants, were lack of
transportation to a grocery store or the distance to
a grocery store. 

4. the most common individual or household barrier,
reported by 30 percent of participants, was lack of
time to prepare meals from scratch that are part of a healthy diet

5. the prevalence of most barriers did not vary
by household composition, income sources,
education level, urbanicity, or region.

6. two barriers – affordability and lack of
cooking equipment or storage – were
associated with household food insecurity.
participants facing an affordability barrier were
2.3 times more likely to experience low or very
low household food security. participants
reporting lack of equipment or storage were 1.6
times more likely to experience low or very low
household food security

"how to report a rude cal fresh worker (on the phone)? i called cal fresh today (ca) looking to see if i can be added to the restaurant meals program since i am about to be homeless soon. i’ve been living at a airbnb for months but i am running out of money, so i only have less than two weeks left.

the lady answering my call was very rude. i got her name and her worker code. she also was trying to hint she can add notes about people through her end. could she add something bad about me on her side to mess up my benefits? 

she had a entitled attitude the whole time and the way she spoke was very condescending. 

two questions,
1. can state workers add details about someone to mess up their benefits?
2. how do i report a rude worker??"
"using snap for cold food then paying cash to have it cooked. illegal?! so there’s a shop my buddy frequents and he told me that i could get hot foods there with snap technically, he explained that if i pay for the cold foods such as seafood with ebt then i could pay cash for the cooking on it. 

i’ve read the snap rules that i can’t buy hot foods but does this apply if i’m able to pay cash to have it cooked? is the business doing something shady?"

calfresh phone on hold hell what is up with the phone lines for calfresh? i've accrued probably 6-7 hours of hold time this week trying to get in touch with a representative. is anyone else experiencing this? whats the deal? do they have the whole week off or something.
"employee error results in loss of benefits. please help in how to get reimbursed? i was sent my re-application paperwork last month, filled it out sent it in early. soon after i receive mail asking for documentation of my income (i have $0 income and writing in the amount a family member pays my landlord directly was misunderstood on the application as income towards myself). the letter had a date i needed to give this info by. so i took the only option i could and called the office. 

my partner spoke for me, besides me giving personal identifying info. he explained the situation to the woman who completely understood the mistake and said she was changing in the system to reflect that i do not receive any income. she also asked if we would like to officially put my partner on as an authorized representative to make calls like this for me, which we said yes. she assured us on the phone that this was all complete. this was 5 business days before the info was required. 

less than a week later, on the day i receive my benefits each month nothing was deposited into my account. of course it was a friday evening when i was about to order groceries, so i had to wait until monday to call to try to figure out the issue. there was no notice in the mail of my benefits ending. so i was hungry and distressed all weekend. 

my partner and i call twice monday, only to be sent to the voicemail of a supervisor who did not return my call.

tuesday (5 days without benefits now) we call again and after it being mentioned that my partner is not authorized as a representative for me, i make the realization - **they have cancelled my benefits because the original woman be called over a week before lied about correcting my information** we make this very clear with them, and at first they claim there is no call on record from us on the 10th (when we first called, they later admitted to having the call logged and gave us the employees name). we’re then thrown around to a useless supervisor, a few more voicemails (all while we are being told that we are being sent to someone who is currently ready to take our call). 

when we finally speak to someone, the best she can offer is that my benefits would be back in another 5 days. we repeat how they have admitted this to be an issue where one of their employees fraudulently claimed she took actions that only a case manager or higher could do and then i lost my benefits due to her negligence and expressed the emotional distress of trying to get the food i need, that never should have been taken from me. we asked for the name and number of this supervisor’s supervisor. 

we took a bit of time to breathe, since we had been on the phone for hours. this supervisor calls us herself in the meantime, pretty quickly she tells us she is fixing the issue and that my benefits will be back in my account by 9am the next morning and gives us her direct number to call if it isn’t. 

the next day, it’s there!! but then…i realize if i was formally receiving benefits on the 21st and now it’s the 26th, due to *their* error/negligence, what happens to the 5 days of benefits i missed due to their error? for me, that’s almost $50 and i completely depend on every cent, esp since the covid benefits just stopped and food costs continue to rise. 

i left the supervisor direct voicemails this past wednesday and again yesterday and have not heard back yet. will i be able to get this reimbursed? is there more i can or should be doing to report this whole situation?

thanks for any help or input. this has been such a headache and i’m already in an unwell physical and mental state, just barely keeping myself surviving.

update 5/2/23: i finally received a call back from a top supervisor in my county (she had been out of office for personal reasons). she understood my concern, and assured that my benefits will return to the 21st starting this month, so there will be no missing benefits. she explained that the date that benefits are received is based on social number, something none of the “experts” in the comments were able to mention in all their talk of policy. this was the exact answer i needed and i’m grateful that the head of my county not only showed true care and compassion for me, but truly put in the time and effort to understand my concern and correct an egregious error of an employee."
end of emergency allotment is anyone else really hurting this month without the emergency allotment? it takes every dollar of cash my family gets to pay our bills. and i lost $700 a month from the emergency allotment. right now i have $8 in food stamps and i’m starting to panic. how do they expect us all to live with such a drastic reduction?
"denial letter - nj | is the caseworker supposed to do the interviews? | snap/tanf | snap benefits cut completely due to pandemic officially ending?/help with resources gf received letter- denied benefits due to failure to submit info requested to process case. here’s the kicker- she sent the info in via email and by mail and thru the portal a month ago. she called the office several times and was told that they were backed up on cases and haven’t had a chance to process her paperwork yet. today, she received the letter. should she file an appeal?

my gf finally got her caseworker on the phone and was told that her application can’t be processed until after she speaks with the interviewer. her caseworker informed her that an interviewer will contact her from the city she lives in…this is confusing because we thought the caseworker is the one who completes the interviews…feels like she’s getting the run around. is this true? - nj

ty all, this sub has been extremely helpful- question: why would someone need to speak with a tanf caseworker before they start receiving their snap benefits, again? - nj

nj- my gf, whom is a single mother of 4, hasn’t received her fs this month. she called snap office yesterday and again this morning, leaving messages both times. and tho, i am also struggling, i took her to the grocery store to get her and the kids some food to hold them over until her next pay day. i can see the stress in her face as she’s now dreading having to cancel her kids’ christmas lay aways so that she can put food on the table. this woman works hard and it’s sadly just not enough money to pay bills, daycare, and afford $400+ groceries for the month. i’ve been going thru this sub and others for a couple days now, looking for information on ways to help her and the kids out with food and for christmas. she is going to utilize the food bank to supplement her grocery bill and has signed up for toys for tots. but does anyone know who else she can contact about her snap benefits or of any other programs that could help her out? also, we heard that benefits are being cut down due to the pandemic officially ending- is it possibly the reason hers hasn’t deposited?"
"how long is it taking in arkansas | frustrated in arkansas | application in arkansas | what can i do to get some answers in arkansas | no word from snap so i applied for stamp jan 6th had all requested info in jan 27th. i was told a decision would be made by feb 27th that they had 30 days to process the application. here it is march 4th and still pending. i called on the 1st and was told they was emailing supervisor and would get a call back but still nothing. so how long is applications taking to get processed sine it's obviously not 30 days

i put my application in january 6th. had all requested information in january 27th. online my case shows i'm approved for snap and medicaid and that everything had been processed but still no stamps on my card. i call the office just to be told that there is one thing still pending that hasn't been looked at yet and that they had until february 27th to make a decision.... here it is february 27th and still nothing. they won't let me talk to a case worker or a supervisor because they said with my application actually but being approved yet i don't have a case worker and that a supervisor won't talk to me about my case. i get that everyone is busy but having hungry mouths to feed and little money to keep food in the fridge is just frustrating. thankfully i was able to fill my fridge for now but that will only last so long.
vent over. lol

i applied for benefits jan 6th all my paperwork has been approved exxept pay stubs. i had to send twice and i'm trying to figure out if there is a reason no one has looked at the last thing. i have a family to feed and have exhausted local recorces to keep us fed. is there anything i can do to get this looked at? we are now living off pancakes

i applied for fs in july. was told i'd have an answer by september 4th..... no answer. called last monday. was told i'd have an answer within 72 hours. called last friday was told i'd have an answer by the end of the day. here it is monday afternoon and still nothing. i have exsaughted all resources in my area as far as food banks go.

i thought they had 30 days to make a decision. how is it they are able to go several months with out making a decision. i got accepted back in march only for them to shut it off in may they said i didn't turn in my  annual. which i did but what ever i reapplied and have been waiting way past 30 days for an answer of any kind. you can't get anyone in the office to answer but this is fusturatin for families who need help. i'm in arkansas if that helps"
"nyc- filed late july, recently approved for cash assistance , snap & medicaid | nyc - the wait to hear back for filing for ca, snap & medicaid is insane. how longs everyone’s wait? | how many months do you get expedited snap for in nyc? | received decision notice on assistance to meet an immediate need nyc | question regarding card (nyc) this is by no mean to brag however i just wanted to inform any new yorkers who are filing, have filed and are in the waiting game some pointers i have realized.

for starters, you have got to call immediately at 8oclock. if you wait even five minutes after you will be on hold for numerous hours. i called at 8 on the dot and received a representative at 8:51 so even at the beginning of the queue is an hour wait. ridiculous.

if it has been thirty days since your file date and no response, there is an inquiry the representative can put in to your base locale and it gives them up to 14 days to reply. that was done for me an in two days i was approved after having waited for two months and a half.

i want to thank everyone who answered question and posted to show that you were still in the waiting game! don’t give up! calling helps!

i filed july 19th 2023. received expedited snap for first month and a half and that’s it. no snap for september and really running it down to the wire atm. running low on all cash and options. would love to have food at the least taken care so i can have breathing room. how long has everyone else been waiting?

i am curious as to how many months do you receive snap benefits for? is it only for one month?

i’m very confused. so i applied for the ca, snap and medicare . my deadline for my interview was yesterday but i did it immediately after i finished applying and confirmed three times that my interview was completed. handed in my documents

however today i received three notices on the hra site , one says that my interview was dated three days prior than the deadline. weird.

then one asking for a document i already turned in

then the next was a decision on assistance to meet immediate need . and it says i was denied for a grant or one shot deal due to not doing my appointment.

does that mean i was denied for food stamps and medicare or just cash assistance?

many years ago i got a card with my face on it from a brooklyn location but after receiving food benefits for two months and a one time cash payment, i misplaced the card and never reported it. 

fast forward to today i am filling out a brand new case , applied, sent documents, they were received and just waiting to be accepted.

question is, do i get a new card sent with the new case, so i have to call them and specify i will need a new card related to this new case? i’m confused and worried.

"ca yolo calfresh sar7 reporting when i initially applied, calfresh automatically pulled my pay stubs from amazon.

2.  i had a pay correction last month for an amazon error the previous month.  it will show i earned over the limit for november, but i really didn't as it was pay earned in oct.  how do i deal with that?

"[nyc] landlord claiming not to have received rent assistance check hello!

i have an active cash assistance (ca) case in nyc. ca includes rent assistance in my case. nyc hra said they sent two rent assistance payments directly to my landlord. landlord is claiming they received the second (~$100), but not the first (~$500).

i contacted hra and they said they sent both checks to the same address (a p.o. box) so they should've received the first since they received the second. they also said both checks were cashed out.

hra gave me a check # and the date it was cashed out. i told my landlord this information and they insist that they never received it, it's not in their records.

what do i do? i'm at a complete loss. is it possible it was stolen in the mail? would people other than my landlord be able to cash out that check? if so, how do i get that ~$500 rent assistance credit?

my question is, how do i go about reporting this to my caseworker? ideally, i wouldn't want to disclose the specifics of my work. but i'm not sure how to explain that the income is not necessarily consistent, heavily relies on tips, etc...  any advice is very appreciated.

"calfresh question: requirement to get ebt card state: ca

when i was living with my parents, my parents' income was too high to get approved for calfresh. however once i moved out, i started buying food for myself and i have little to no income: living mostly from financial aid and savings. i applied for calfresh with this fact and got approved.

but my parents think there must've been an error since they still declare me as dependent when filing for tax. regardless of the fact that i now buy food for myself alone, they think that shouldn't count since i am still a dependent.

are my parents right and i should cancel my ebt to avoid a huge fine?"

it almost seems like they took the amount that i was getting in food stamps which is about $380 * 2 and subtracted that

"i accidentally lied, now what? **tl;dr:** accidentally lied about unearned income, i shouldn't qualify but i did, but now i need to prove the unearned income, but i still need food stamps. what do i do? is there any way to still qualify even though i messed this up? or cancel my application and somehow try again later? am i going to get in trouble?

background: i am disabled, including cognition related disabilites. i live alone and rely on unearned income from family that covers the basics of rent, food, caregiving. however i often don't eat enough because food prices keep rising and my family can only send so much. my rent is pretty high (it was lower when i moved in, but i can't move because it's hard to find ada accessible housing) so money for rent + food + caregiving puts me over the income limit for ebt.

the issue: i accidentally lied about my ""unearned income"". i had been receiving an amount from family so i can survive and not die that was under the cutoff for ebt for a while, but i forgot they recently started sending me more because i'm disabled and needed help around the house and also my rent went up. and now it's over the cutoff, including when i applied, but when i applied, i said the old number by accident because the form was overwhelming.

so i already applied and got approved for state healthcare and food stamps, except the last step of verification for food stamps is i need my family to send an email saying they only send the amount that they used to send, which now isnt true and would be lying more.

i'm just not sure what to do because it's not like i suddenly dont need food stamps because my rent went up and i needed help with my disability and i don't have a caregiver covered by the state yet?

i'm trying really hard to gain financial independence through getting on ssi/ssdi, food stamps, state healthcare, and eventually getting some kind of part time gig once im more stable. hopefully someday rent assistance. this is a bit of a wrench in that plan

what do i do? 

the problem is like, i can't make the rent go down and i can't stop needing caregiving. so i need this amount of unearned income. but i need to get on government assistance because this unearned income is not reliable longterm, i can't rely on my family forever for a variety of reasons. but i can't get the government assistance unless i have less money.

i'm just really confused what to do now. i'm worried they'll get me in trouble for fraud or whatever. the truth is part of my disabilities is also cognitive issues. memory and thinking and especially numbers and keeping track of things is not something i'm good at right now. 

i feel like they won't understand if i try to explain myself and i'm also not always super great at making myself understood, especially when i'm nervous. and i'm very nervous because obviously i dont want to like, go to jail or have food stamps suspended or something where they will no longer be an option for me, i need to keep that option open."

"what’s first phone call with caseworker going to be like? so last year i did a snaps application and was denied while working part time 25 hours weekly and making less than 1500 a month. this was in a different city and i moved this year. i hadn’t applied since moving counties even though i needed to but now i’m recently unemployed due to mental health issues and had to apply. i have a call scheduled with a caseworker but i’m nervous as to what that’ll be like. the problem is on the application i put down the costs of all of my utilities and rent that i have been paying (and will continue with the little savings i have for as long as i can) but i live with my boyfriend and after i need some help with finances, he’s going to take on more of these costs until i find a new job. i feel like this will be a problem because i listed myself as the only person in the household, we definitelyy don’t share food. but i wouldn’t qualify for sure with him listed and that’s i’m worried about. i’m hoping to find a job soon but needed to get some help for my mental health, and with the work experience i have i might make little enough even at a next job to qualify for a lesser amount. but for now i do need as much as i can get, so would it raise red flags to tell her i’m using the little savings i have and a credit card to pay for utilities, rent etc until i find income and potentially might get help from family down the road but don’t currently? i just am not sure how this works but could use some help about what they ask because it’s giving me anxiety."

i know government systems and updates can be archaic. from what i've read, legislative bills have boilerplate language...  91 days after the legislative session adjourns (unless they voted effective immediately) which december 31, 2023.... so i wouldn't qualify until march 31, 2024?  if that's the case i won't even bother applying now.

hi all, hoping to get some clarity. i live in my mom's home. i lost my job around covid and can't find work. was/am getting by on unemployment, savings/pantries. i'm over 30. since assets are no longer taken into consideration in michigan, i was wondering if i would be eligible. 

mom, widow 65,on ss/pension has 2 other kids in the home, both over 22 (not that it matters since they're doing well). **should i list ""everyone who lives in your home"" and then select the option that we buy / prepare food separately in the appilcation? or just list myself?** i know they can look up who resides at the address. if i had to list their income information, i know how much they make. 

if i don't list them, i'd think it looks like i'm lying. i'd rather say it all in the application than try to explain it over the phone interview. everyone is like roommates at this point, pretty much doing their own thing in regard to food. i try to pay a few hundred in rent. since i make no income does it matter? i've been trying to look it up and all i see is earned and unearned income discussions. do they count deductions if you have no income?

"time limit rules and agent not answering phone or messages i've been on stamps a little over a year now due to becoming physically disabled, i have not applied for disability yet however but i have been out of work due to my conditions, i have been trying to get better and find work but it is not going well.

recently got notified of the time limit rules, saying that after sept 30th, unless i contact my agent and inform them that i do not have transportation, or am physically unable to work, i will be lose benefits immediately and be ineligible for benefits again until 2025.

 i traded my car in a few months ago to help me get by, as it had become totaled anyway due to a rack and pin failure. getting rid of it eliminated my insurance bill and seemed liie the best option, as repairs would have totaled over the cars value. i have heart disease and a thyroid condition, on top of other things that are out of my control that sprung up a few years ago that makes daily life perpetually harder than it used to be. all of these should make me exempt from having to adhere to the time limit rules.

the paperwork says if i am not declared exempt from the time limit rules by sept 30th, i will be ineligible for food assistance again until 2025. 

here's where it gets weird, my agent has not answered their phone for me in months, nor responded to my messages. recently looked their supervisor up and tried to call them instead. same deal. so i called the hotline to try to inform them of my claim to exemption, and the hotline workers had no idea what the time limit rules were, and called me back a few hours later saying to ride out my benefits until november when i am up for re certification and just re-apply and see what they say.

i told them that i have until sept 30th or i lose access until 2025. 
they acted like they did not know what i was talking about and said to just re-apply in november when my current allotment of benefits expires.

a friend of mine that used to work for the state, and a social worker i know both said it sounded like they are trying to screw me out of the system and find a reason to deny me long term. 

i am planning to visit the fns office in person next, i suppose it is all i can do, but i am wondering if this is normal for agents to not answer their phones these days, and get other peoples opinions here.  i hope you're all doing well btw and having a good day.  thanks for any opinions or advice."

"snap discontinued for incorrect reporting long story, please bare with me. 


location california 
in january i became suddenly disabled. i immediately applied for snap benefits, sdi, and medical leave through work. 

i was approved for leave and sdi, but got a letter saying i was denied for snap benefits. this didn't surprise me at all as even on disability i made more than the allowed income. i did nothing and assumed i didn't qualify. 

about 2-3 weeks after the denial letter, i received an approval letter in the mail stating i was entitled to x amount of benefits each month and to look out for a card. i was confused, so i called my local benefits office and left a message in hopes to clarify. they never called me back. i called a couple more times again with no call back. i did receive a card in the mail with back benefits on it. 

fast forward to july, and i have to recertify. i fill out my paper work and send it back. over the this last week end i receive a letter stating that i did not include my paid leave information on my original application and they want that information. i'm no dumby. i'm certainly not trying to commit fraud, and i just can't imagine that's fact. as i said before i was initially denied because was getting what i thought was too much income any way. 

what action do i need to take? i feel like calling doesn't work. (it's quite hard to get in touch with some one as the automated system sends me around in circles) but i plan to call again in the morning. 

is there a website i can view my application to check the legitimacy of this?

any help is appreciated, thank you."
"do i need updated tax return to reapply? i got approved for snap end of december after about a month long wait for an interview. i just got paperwork in the mail saying i need to renew my certification already. which i don’t mind but my income verification was via my taxes due to being self employed. the woman who set me up took copies of everything and said i shouldn’t need updated returns until end of year but looking at the paperwork it mentions most recent year taxes need to be included (usually do later in april).

i applied for calfresh benefits over a month ago when my work started cutting back hours and since i made below whatever the standard was i got expedited the three days. my case worker said i needed to upload paystubs to the site i applied on which i did but she didn't receive them. i gave her a call and she had the actual website i needed to upload to listed on her voicemail so i set up my account and submit them there but i think it was too late. i got approved for $13 and i have no idea why she put that i made nearly $700 more than i was making but there's that. i tried calling a few more times and leaving voicemails and she doesn't answer. i lost my job two weeks ago due to position elimination and i was able to update the change of job loss and i have yet to hear from anyone. i requested a reevaluation for anytime last week and nothing. with absolutely o income i'm not sure where i'm left. do i send in another application?? there's no way i can live off $13 currently especially with no one hiring/they’re looking for very specific things like a youtube actor, reptile handler and warehouse jobs that do not give me the time of day despite physically busting my ass in the interviews. i'm frustrated as hell.

edit: can’t believe i have to say it but suggesting i get a secondary cell phone on that $13 is… ridiculous. it’s also quite ridiculous to think i can nutritionally survive off $13 a month. even at winco.

"question for work requirements and using up benefits. hi all,
this is a 2 part question. based in ohio
1. i just received a letter today saying since my youngest is now 6 i'm expected to be working 30 hours a week. i sent an email to my countys office explaining i homeschool my children, have them 75% of the time already and only work when they're with their father which is generally 10 hours a week. i included my excusal from our school districts superintendent as proof i'm schooling them. is that enough?
2. if they do decide to end my benefits due to me not working enough am i able to use what's already on the card or will they cancel it and i lose all of it? 
thank you!"

we tried contacting the ebt admin in our state, but they just said we could dispose of it if we don’t use it, and they don’t know why we qualified. i’d like to know what happens to the funds if we don’t use it. does it just go back to the program? is it written off regardless of it being used? 

we prefer to return the funds to the program, but we also aren’t going to just not use the funds if they simply disappear.  

also, would anyone have any idea how we possibly qualified? we do live in a school district that offers free breakfast and lunch to all students. my child doesn’t attend virtually, but they did have one virtual only class last year. they also did not have covid last year.

"ca missed interview | sar 7 ca other income ebay reporting | calworks and government shutdown. | calffesh/calwork and ira ca, la county

 hi, i had a renewal for my calfresh due on the 1/5/23 which i did on time, with a phone interview on the 6th. they never called for the interview and i got a letter in the mail saying i missed the appointment and that i had until 7/30/23 to complete.  which i thought was odd. but ok.

 i also had my redetermination for calworks due on 1/31/23. i was filling it out today online and saw that i had been sent a notice that my calworks was ending on 1/31/23 because i missed my phone interview on the 6th. 

 i didn't know they are connected. i am still able to fill out my redetermination online, and it doesn't show discontinued. the helpfulness of the reps varies considerably, but if they are using all my previous info (bank statements, proof of income) i would just call or should i fill it out online.

so i uploaded my sar 7 and in the other income section i entered the total i withdrew from my ebay account, and uploaded the dec statement as proof of income. i realized after doing this, is i had 93.83$ that rolled over from nov. and was included in the amount i entered as total income for dec. 
question is, is money i made in nov, but actually acquired in dec count as income for dec or nov.

this la county

hi, me, my wife, and son are on calfresh and calworks. we get the max 663/1074 a month and our irt is $1056.

we learned my wife has an ira setup from a previous employer she wasn’t aware of. it has about $3300, and we are in need and are going to withdraw it.

question is, is this considered income, or a one time payment? after taxes it will be about $2600. the money will be spent almost immediately. but i don’t know how much this will effect the amount we get for the following month. or will we get terminated?"
"calling in to snap.. | snap denial because of son's ssa for the love of god why/ how do they not have a better verification system? i always have to spend so much time calling these people because there's always problems. first thing you have to tell them is your name. why don't they have a system that either recognizes your phone number automatically or after your enter your social? the whole thing is a joke. first person i talk to needs all the information, then 2-3 minute brief hips to go over my case and then they transfer me to a case worker who can ""better assist"" me. ffs. the amount of time i spend on the phone with these people is absurd. i bet people who lie to get snap don't even have to go through as much crap. 🤷‍♂️

i'm on disability. means my son's mom have equal, joint custody. neither of us pay the other child support to the other. my son (about to be 13,) gets money each month because of me being on disability. my son's mom is considered his primary address because of school. even though, i live in the same county as his school and she doesn't. so somehow, she became the payee. the money he gets is supposed to ""follow him."" she keeps all of the money. that's an issue in its own. the from now, with snap, is his money is getting added into mine and his income. i wouldn't need snap if his mom didn't keep all the money. the amount my son gets is half of what i get from ssdi. i don't know where to get/find information on the money my son gets. when i go to my ssa account, there's nothing mentioned about the money he gets (because of me being on disability.) snap wants proof that my son's mom keeps all the money. ssa has told me numerous that they can't give me any type of paperwork showing any of this info. curious if anyone has dealt with this. it's a constant battle with food stamps but, there's so many people who lie about everything and all get snap."

"questions about foodstamps (pennsylvania) hello. i currently rent out a room from some people, and they are worried i'm going to hurt their food stamps benefits. i wonder why, as i only share barely any rent and no money otherwise. i buy my own food, and they are still below the poverty line with my rent.

as far as i'm aware that makes me a ""roomer"", which is someone not included in a household, yet for some reason my income is being included within the household income. the same could be said for a family member of theirs (i'm not related to these people) that lives in a different room and doesn't even pay rent, but buys their own food. they are included as well in the household income.

why is this? what do you do about that? would it hurt their income less if i didn't pay rent? maybe not as this relative does just that. don't really have anywhere else to go, would like to find some answers, thank you for reading."

"alabama ebt notice about expiring funds on closed case i closed my food stamps case in alabama around mid-february of 2022 after getting a job that made me ineligible for benefits. i reported the income increase then a few months later in may of 2022, i moved to mississippi and also reported the address change. i did not need to apply to ms food stamps program, and i stopped using my card since i figured the balance on there wasn't right for me to use. i believe i had an emergency need for the funds, and with a balance still, i used probably less than $200 of it around june sometime. i knew i'd be able to pay back $200 if it came down to them saying it wasn't mine to spend, but i didn't use it again after that. 

now it's been 8 months since i've used the card, but i just received a letter (to my new mississippi address) from alabama food assistance offices letting me know i have benefits that they, quote ""encourage me to use"" before they expire in 30 days. i checked my balance to find $1100 on there. i know i hadn't been using it all monthly even prior to the income increase since i lived alone. from what i can tell, no new funds have been issued all this time. it's just prior balance. 

my question is: am i safe to use these funds? 

i don't want to assume, but it was sent to my now out of state address. i reported all the information to them in a timely manner as well as noting that my case is officially closed and has been for some time. i just don't want to end up either having to pay the funds back or worse. any information would be helpful and much appreciated."

typically, when this happens, the card covers the $28, then you pay the rest in cash, debit, etc. 

i swiped once, and it was declined (i chose the ebt food option as usual). i swiped it again, as i wanted to use the $28, then another payment. after i swiped it again, my whole purchase was approved on my card. even though my balance shouldn't cover it. it's been an hour or two, and my snap balance is still $28. 

i have the receipt just in case. any one else have this issue? it's only $11, so i can pay it if need be. i'm just scared of my benefits getting taken away. 

i looked online and i can't find anything, and everything just says that you will pay the remainder via cash or other means for the remainder of your balance, but that clearly didn't happen. am i going to get in trouble? who do i contact if i need to? i've never seen or heard of this happening before.

first concern. i was enrolled for a little less than a year in ny snap. the last month-ish of my snap benefits, i took on a temporary job, only cashing two checks during that time. in total, the checks were less than $1,000. i had no additional income as a full time student. the checks were written a few weeks before they were actually cashed, because of the time it took to receive them via mail. during that same time frame, i had also already received a letter in the mail about recertification of benefits. i chose not to submit recertification. did the two checks need to be reported, even if i was still totaling below the poverty line? and if i had already received the recertification notice? if so, what timeline should they have been reported on (considering written and cashed dates)?

&#x200b;

second concern. when i applied and was accepted, i used my off-campus apartment address. i have lived and still live at that address. however, although the small job i did was virtual, the w-9 i sent in used my out of state hometown address. i'm not sure why i used hometown, force of habit. will this be an issue later on as this tax form is showing a different address than the address i used for snap and it was signed during that last month i was receiving benefits? the address i used for snap is my primary residence. can i alter the w-9 a month out from submitting it? unsure if i should be worried about this or need to change anything.

i'm aware this is a blurb of complex worries. i want to be sure i am avoiding unnecessary trouble and doing the right thing. i have immense anxiety around some error in my benefits causing serious issue for me. please offer any knowledge or advice you can."
"balance removed due to inactivity i had over $1k in cash aid and i received a letter stating the county stopped acces to my ebt card. it’s been 6 months since i’ve used it. but when i called the toll free number to check my balance, i have $0 on my account. why is that?

"suddenly got a huge amount of food-stamps after only being qualified for 23$ a month? so, me and my husband applied for foodstamps a couple of months ago, and only got approved for 23$ a month. i went to check if we had gotten our second 23$ payment, and when i checked it said we received a 23$ payment on the day it was due, and 500+$ the day after.
for more info, my husband works full time and makes okay money and pays all our expenses. i don't work at all. was this a mistake? should i call my office?

"max allotment extensions info i've been using this website to find out if calfresh max allotment will be extended. hopefully it will be helpful to others. for california, it shows they plan to issue july's benefits on 8/16. you need to select your state, and scroll to the document about emergency allotments.

"eating enough calories and staying healthy while broke ideas-walmart prices-your ideas? i used to be on food stamps with my family. i posted this in another group, but i thought this group would work as well. i tried to think up a cheap grocery list for a whole month only using walmart prices here in **connecticut**. i'm basing my ideas off of someone needing around 2255 calories a day. i also chose the smaller portions of each food item. at my walmart they usually have large bags of cheese, but for rice sometimes they only have the small bags. also, my local walmart does not have produce or a deli. do you guys have a cheaper healthy meal plan based off of a person who needs 2255 calories a day?

"recently unemployed oregon

i got fired from my job yesterday, i was only there for a month and i got fired because i was looking for another job…which is feel is another problem of itself. food stamps wanted me to submit 2 more paystubs so 3 all together…obviously that can’t happen now, what do i tell them? they almost took away my benefits because i switched jobs before this so i’m kinda worried they’ll take it away. my benefits aren’t very much but i wouldn’t be able to get groceries without it."

"why do people turn down the $23 in benefits? | 211 is down in texas please, if you have a moment…i sincerely want to understand this line of thinking. i promise you i am not being sarcastic, but i just don’t understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it’s “not enough”?  i genuinely want to know. 

the current minimum snap benefit is $23. this is what most seniors receive. i hate that and i agree that is not enough. obviously that’s not enough. but if you are hungry why would you turn down $23? the food pantry is not enough. if you are having trouble affording food, why turn down help?

personally, i don’t qualify for anything anymore. but i think of it like, if a grocery store were to give me a $23 gift card every month i would love that. even now, when i can afford to pay on my own. i would absolutely love a $23 bonus. 

obviously it’s not enough to feed myself or my family but it’s enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs, bread, and milk. i see it as that’s $23 of my own money that i don’t have to spend on groceries. so that’s $23 more every month that could go towards bills, prescriptions, or whatever. 

i especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $23 because it’s not enough (which i agree) but then struggle to afford their meds, skip meals , pay late fees on their bills because they were $10 short, have $35 withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc. i know $23 is not enough, and i know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $23 is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount. 

please help explain why so many people, especially seniors, turn down this benefit. i genuinely do not understand.

for clients living in texas there is currently an outage affecting the 211 call center. in the mean time, if you need information about your case you can access your account on yourtexasbenefits.com or go into your local office."
"take care when ordering online from walmart | what is going on with ebt eligibility lately? az | distilled water no longer covered? they attempt to partially charge cash for certain items such as candy, including ice breakers gum or other items, not sure why it happens.

first, i couldn't buy distilled water with my ebt card on walmart, now i can't buy milk? isn't milk one of the prime eligible items?



i found out what it is, walmart is excluding their store brand milk and stuff from ebt customers, that's got to be illegal right? who do i report this to?

i know it's not that big of a deal it's only a dollar per gallon but i've been buying distilled water for my cpap machine with my snap benefits for the past year now and now when i try to order a new gallon via walmart it says it's no longer snap eligible is that the case for anyone else do you know why it was deemed ineligible?"
"p-ebt 4.0 - why did i get this, can i use it without any repercussions? (ca) i just got this card in the mail.  while i am on medicaid (medi-cal), i never applied for food stamps (which is calfresh, i guess).

did i get this because my kids had free lunches at school the past year?  i don't know if every kid took them, but i'm pretty sure every kid could have gotten free lunches for the last two years because something newsom implemented.  so did every family get these cards?  

btw, i didn't get 1.0/2.0/3.0 (i'm assuming there were three before, given the name), and started on medi-cal in early 2022.

i'm still on medi-cal, but i think i will probably get kicked off in november when i renew as i just started a job this month, and it'll be enough to push me over income limits (up until now, i've only had a job that didn't pay much because i didn't have steady hours).  

if i use this card, will i be subject to having to pay any of it back?  

(less important questions: is it a one-time balance, or does it get refilled periodically?  and i have two kids, and the card has my younger son's name on it.  would there be one coming for my daughter, two years older but also school aged?)"
food stamp increase or decrease? hi. i need some help. i live in nj if that makes a difference. i got a letter in the mail the other day saying my food stamps have been raised from $20 to $147. but it doesn't make sense because  i get $250 a month. can someone help me im really confused and would like to avoid having to call them. have my food stamps been reduced or is this an error? thanks
"am i forfeiting my balance when i report i've gone over the income threshold? google hasn't been of any help, and i don't really want to call and ask in case if it's ""throwing away"" the balance i have right now.

basically, should i try to rush and spend it all before i call?"

"vent about refunds and fees i'm disabled so depending on flare ups, i can't go out to buy food when i need to. i used to use amazon fresh but their fee hikes priced me out of it. i had $80 on my ebt card and tried to make a purchase from safeway. they had a free trial for their delivery service and their food had lower prices than amazon so i thought that would be a good idea. well, the order didn't show up. i call customer service and i'm told that i have to refund it and that the refund can take up to 5 days. i have to wait 5 days to eat for a mistake they made? i don't have enough now to retry the order or even a smaller order because of the minimum order amount. i do have some food, i'm not going to starve, but i spent hours doing a run around just to be told to wait 5 days. many people on ebt benefits can't wait that long. i'm sick of these delivery services screwing us while they look for profits. 

to be fair, this was likely a simple mistake at safeway. but being pushed into this situation by amazon made me incredibly angry. anyone else had a similar experience?"
"learn from my mistake... i am so frustrated. we are like seriously broke... we had $88 left in the bank for car tag (due in aug, so yeah, late) and $20 left on ks- snap. my ssdi check doesn't come till the 13th and snap reloads on the 7th. 
we desperately needed some groceries and prescriptions, so we decided this would be the last time we drive till i get paid to get tags and use what we had for the food and scripts. we purchased the scripts separately and the food and non food items together at self checkout. i never saw anything different on the screen as i swiped both the snap card and bank card. saw a text when we got home that our bank was -$20. what?!? the snap had not gone through. it's not even showing up on my receipt. if you have more food items than snap money, does it deny the whole snap card? why doesn't it pay the amount left on the card if that's the case? i know my pin was accepted, but after that didn't notice anything wrong till i got home. now i have a -$30 overdraft fee as well... grrrr. i guess take this as a precaution so it doesn't happen to you!"
"escalated snap case (tx) | waiting on snap renewal; application was send early/mid feb i posted earlier in the past month about my snap case still in “sent” status and that it was backlogged most likely. i was able to get to a human on the phone who said my case would be escalated. this was last week; my question is what does my case being escalated do and when should i contact again? it’s been very difficult without the snap supplement this month so far. :(

i was curious if anyone else has been waiting a long time for a renewal to get reviewed and approved. i sent my docs as well in towards the end of february and my benefits end 3/31. i checked this morning on the status and it’s still “sent”. just checking to see if anyone else has had the same situation w/ their renewals.

"no benefits since july? haven't missed/been late recert. ny we have sent in paperwork twice since july and have received no benefits. any inquiry into status dead ends if you get anyone to talk to at all. the last we spoke with someone we were given confused information about dates, implying we missed the deadline. this is not the case and we have confirmation numbers saved.

are we getting the retroactive balance for the time they have let lapse without benefit? covering the difference is taking away from other expenses and i would just like to know if i can count on not having that much to spend on food once benefits finally do kick in."
"oh ffs, trump is bringing back that asinine “harvest box” plan again. snap benefits replaced with a box of processed crap. [snap] half of people’s benefits would be confiscated and instead they would (somehow) be issued a box of generic crap food, like salty canned vegetables, canned fruit in sugary syrup, boxed mac and cheese, sugary cereal and peanut butter. no choice in what they get.  no concern about people with diet restrictions or health problems like celiac disease, diabetes, food allergies or even a deadly reaction to peanuts.    imagine how much a months worth of canned food would weigh and how expensive it would be to ship them. and then what? the boxes are left on the steps to get rained on or stolen or ripped into by raccoons and coyotes?  your child had a life- threatening allergy to peanuts? tough shit, you’re getting peanut butter anyway. this is so moronic it makes my blood boil.

"food stamp in ohio income limit/calculation so i was originally only working around 22 hours a week, and my income was $1400/month, just below the threshold of $1470. however, i've also noticed that there were also deductions (like part of rent, earned income, standard etc.) that equalled $500. does that mean i can make $1970 a month and still be eligible for food stamps?

also, is the income calculated over a yearly, monthly, or weekly period. like some weeks, i would work extra, and some weeks, i may not work at all or go on winter break/vacation (i'm a full time student as well) .

thanks,

will a new job cause my food stamps card to be canceled? to clarify title. i’m currently on food stamps and have saved up a decent balance as i usually buy pretty cheap for myself. however i’m starting a new job in january that has enough income to disqualify me from the program. when i update my job status will my balance be removed or can i still use my remaining balance (that i received while qualified) or do i need to spend it all before my new job in january.
"income verification letter sent and case worker stating benefit overpayment a couple months ago i had applied for calfresh and i didn't have a job at the time but i told my caseworker that i was going to start at one on the 19th and that i would have an income soon. i told her how much i would be making (part time so not that much) and i understood from her that i was still eligible for benefits but that they would be reduced. i later got the job and started working. i was receiving 95 + 281. i was under the impression that 95 was my reduced benefit and 281 was the covid emergency pay, so i thought everything was fine. 6 months later, i call back to renew benefits since i hadn't updated them in time, and the case worker tells me that i had unreported income which i was really confused about because i thought they knew i had this job, hence the reduced benefits. i see now that i made over the threshold for qualifying, but i wanted to know how much i pay back. i stopped working in february (only worked 4.5 months), so would i have to pay back everything or only what i received when working? also, i currently don't have a job but i am interviewing for one next week, would it even be worth applying for benefits (only work 10ish hrs/week) since i know one of the payment plans is them taking overpayment out of your benefits? i want to pay back the amount i owe i just don't know how to get an estimate or how long it will take to get an amount from them."

"i’m almost 24 and make up to only $150 a month selling art online due to being too mentally ill to work. but i live with my parents. could i be qualified for food stamps for just myself? i’ve read up on it but i’m still confused. some say you have to count the entire household income (which my dad makes around $70k a year) so i’m sure that would disqualify me. but others say if you’re over 22, you can be your own “household”. you may ask, why get food stamps if your dad makes good money? they already have to pay for so much for my medical bills/medications/therapy and they’re going into debt over random problems that keep popping up. i really want to be able to provide food for myself.

 (i’ve also been trying to get on disability because i over-qualify for that lmao but i keep getting rejected even though i’m autistic, bipolar, severely anxious, depressed, and have ptsd) so at the least i wanted to try to get on food stamps

"medicaid i know this platform is for ebt/snap, but felt people here are very knowledgeable on both. 

we live in fl. i had a baby 1/10/23 and haven't worked since, and won't be going back. my baby spent 11 days in nicu and at birth was told he should get medicaid and qualify based off birth weight alone (i'm now aware that isn't true). upon birth we both had soc of almost 5k. he has now been approved for straight medicaid as of 4/1, but has hospital bills that come in right under the soc amount. 

so now i sit here with about 4k in bills for him and 4k in bills for myself and no way to pay them.

is there anything else i can do with medicaid to try and get them to help, at least with my baby?

**edit** - may have asked this question too soon, at the end of the online application, it does ask this (does anyone buy and make food separately from the rest of the household).

edit i’d like to add that my renewal isn’t due until july and i didn’t receive any letters about changes

i was approved for 487$ for august as a family of 3, we became a family of 4 on the 4th and submitted new baby’s info but was told he wouldn’t be added til september when benefits increase. today i woke up to a random 380$ deposit out of nowhere and no notice or anything of why. i’m nervous to spend what if it’s a mistake? even if they started to count new baby the september balance is 181 less than the amount it comes out to with 487+380.

i was supposed to get a call from a mdhhs specialist today within the time frame of 8:45-9:15 am, ive been waiting all day it’s now 2:15pm and nobody has called. it’s for my food stamps renewal i submitted the online application and submitted proof of new income and all expenses already and still nothing. i’m worried they’re gonna just not call and say i missed the appointment and cancel my benefits which is really dangerous for me i’m currently pregnant and it’s high risk i can’t afford to have my medicaid cut off just because a worker decided they weren’t gonna call me or even answer my calls. 

does anyone know if they cut off medicaid along with food stamps even if they sent a medicaid renewal already and the phone call is supposed to be for food stamps? i don’t know how snap works it’s the first time i’ve gotten it and this is the first renewal i’ve ever done for food stamps my medicaid usually auto renews every year. 

for reference my yearly income definitely falls under the poverty guidelines set for a family of 2, which is around 23,000 my husband only makes 21,600 a year. 

anyone know what i can do? i called my worker 3x today her mailbox is full so i can’t even leave a message.

i think i did my interview with her, she asked me a few questions but basically it was the same things i answered in my application. i have until the 7th but do i just have to wait 30 days to find out if i'm approved? i don't know if i did the interview with the right person or not?
also, i was receiving food stamps in south carolina (i never had to do an interview) last year but i'm living in a motel in florida and i stopped getting benefits the beginning of 2021... on my interview letter it said i have 10 days to get them a closure letter from sc telling them when i stopped receiving benefits? how do i do that?"

and, unfortunately, still unemployed, but have some prospects. if i got a couple hundred on top of getting a job i could easily get an apartment and being back at base level. just really hoping i qualify in some way"

"nyc snap anybody having issues with snap in new york? i applied for snap benefits 2 months ago, and i uploaded all the required documents 2-3 different times. i still get notices that my required documents are due and the ""due date"" is a different one each time. my application got rejected for ""not providing"" the documentation, which is ridiculous because their own system shows the documents uploaded plus the due date. 

so i re-applied, made sure to upload everything again one shot and i'm still getting letters saying i need to upload documents. the website says i have more documents to provide, but the mobileapp says i have no documents left to provide. the due dates are all different, and on top of all this, i can't contact anybody over the phone. i've called all the phone numbers i can find and can't talk to a single human. their website support keeps replying saying they can only help with account issues (like it issues).

this whole thing is a mess and i really these benefits in my current situation. 

anybody have any thoughts?"
p ebt 2.0 card reissued so i know that i if you didn’t receive the cards or used the benefits you were able to call to receive a new one. i called july 17 to this number 1(800)-887-8230 and i gave the operator all of my information but when i decided to message the live chat this morning to ask when i would get the new card they said that i don’t have a case open and that it’s too late because the deadline was 8/18. is anyone having this issue? i tried calling back to that number but it’s not working. any help/advice would be great
"nj snap name changed to monkey hi so, i applied for nj snap back in february never heard back, recently went to check a few days ago, application still says pending interview. what i found weird is that my name on the application is now “monkey”. i cropped the photo to take all the private info out. 

i was a little shocked, and pissed but also there’s no way i typed my name as that. 

so out of curiosity i did another application, carefully spelled my name (to which i’ve never had to painstakingly do) and submitted it. 
and whaddya know, the system changes my first name to “monkey” again. 

i did a tweet to the nj benefits official twitter, and they called me immediately and claimed it might be a system error and would call me back about it after speaking to the “director”—that was 2days ago. 
i’m so lost and confused but also feeling insulted i’m not even sure how to respond to it, am i overreacting??? is this a thing where the system just changed the name to a similar word in the alphabet? like d delta or b boy? like i don’t want to jump and say it’s because i’m black because i could be over exaggerating—but has anyone else noticed this as well?"
please help how do i fill out the ebt 2259 online and submit it if i can't open my pdf files

"ebt card got skimmed, la california los angeles county california
so my card got skimmed at some point in july and my general relief was stolen, the month of august and september, i assumed i didn't receive my gr in august cause of some paperwork my grow manager didn't update when i didn't receive my september payment i called the customer services and came to found out my general relief was taken from a citibank atm(i've never used citibank only bank of america) i went ahead canceled the ebt card and waiting for a new one, in the process of filing a claim to see if i can get reimbursed.

this is where my question comes in, i was told to file a report with lapd, when i couldn't do it online i went to an lapd south division branch and was told due to where i live i would have to file a report with a sheriff station, i got to the sheriff station and waiting for like 6 hours before a deputy showed up and he didn't look like he wanted to file a report and referred me to file it online with the fbi on a site call ic3-gov, that i could get a report number from them to file my claim,  i was skeptical but the deputy said he was busy and took off, i went back to the sheriff station to get a second opinion, the counter was closed by then so i had to use a phone to talk to someone in the back, i told them my situation and that i wanted a report number to file my claim like i don't expect this to be solved i just need a report number to file my claim, so they told me the same deputy would be back shortly to handle my case, dude came back and i told him i just need a report number like i would do the online filing but i would feel better and reassured if i could get a number today, he seemed not wanting to do anything to help but looked over some of the transaction evidence and eventully relented an gave me report number.

i still went to file online with that ic3-gov website, lol and it did not give me a report number.

my question is, was this the correct process i took, or would there have been a better path to have file my claim?"

"ineligible items for ebt (california) | can i buy kombucha with ebt? last week i went to buy lactaid at the target but the register at self-check out said that it was ineligible for food stamps. how could milk be ineligible for food stamps? even the cashier herself rung it up and said it came up the same so i just left without buying it. kinda felt awful too. similar thing happened again today when i went to target to buy groceries and it said that the frozen veggies weren't eligible for food stamps, so i ended up just paying for it myself. that time i did it not at self check out, but with a cashier. 

&#x200b;

is it something with target's system? how could milk and frozen veggies not be eligible for food stamps? should i call the local county office about it? i'm so frustrated and i don't wanna deal with that anxiety and embarassment for holding up the line because i can't pay for some items that are clearly eligible for food stamps.

just curious. i’m in california by the way. i get so much anxiety purchasing things at the register only to find out that they’re not ebt eligible. i can’t find anything online though, maybe because it’s a rising popular item. thanks in advance!"

"if you have food stamps, download fetch rewards. i haven't paid a penny for my neccessities in months. its an app that gives you money back for every receipt you scan and extra points if you buy the brand's and offers. the money is redeemable by $3, $5, $10, $20 and $50 gift cards and there are loads to choose from. 

if you buy their offers with food stamps, youd essentially be getting free money back since its not coming out of your own pocket. they also have offers for household and personal products .

whenever someone uses your code, you get 2,000 - 4,000 points. so if you have your family or friends sign up, you can easily make some money.

ive had this app since july and got $161 as of 2 weeks ago.
its really helped me save my real money because ive been using gift cards to buy my neccessities or occassionally spoil myself.

also, my friend buys and returns things sometimes just to get the free points but i dont take it that far lol. 

if you use this code, you'll get 2,000 points (2$) when you sign up and scan a receipt - q8w75

there are other similar apps such as ibotta but i dont think theyre as good as fetch. ive earned $43 since july on ibotta. theres lots of extra rules too but i guess its still money.

the 2 others i know are receipt pal and coinout but theyre slow. you can have all these apps at the same time and download the same reciept on all of them.

i hope this helps someone!

edit: as far as my friend buying and returning things, she doesn't have food stamps. forgot to add that."

i guess i just assumed we would get an expedited case since we have no income, but i haven’t heard anything yet. is that normal? if so, what are the next steps? i looked through the posts on here and it seems like most people got an email or letter or a phone call pretty quickly letting them know what was happening."

"ny - received a letter from an investigator asking for the same docs i already submitted for recertification. why? | [ny] denied benefits at rectification because it was alleged that i have business that i have no knowledge of or participation in. **background**:

last year during recert, caseworker alleged that i had a business. the caseworker saw that a defunct/nonexisting business may have existed at my address but wasn't associated with me. a whole range of aggravation ensued as i was asked to prove a negative (that i don't have any affiliation with this business). you can read about it here if interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/yd8ga9/ny\_denied\_benefits\_at\_rectification\_because\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/yd8ga9/ny_denied_benefits_at_rectification_because_it/)

scheduled a fair hearing last year and a few days before the hearing, the supervisor who would have represented the office approved my recert application and sent a letter stating that the worker made a ""mistake."" i cancelled the fair hearing as i was satisfied with the outcome.

&#x200b;

**current**:

i got the same worker for my current recert. so i was already on edge thinking that the caseworker might be out for vengeance. i called a number of times and spoke to her once because i never received an telephone interview. when i spoke to her, she said interview not required and that i would get a letter in the mail. follow up phone call a few weeks later since i didn't receive anything in the mail regarding needed documents, once i identified myself, she hung up on me with an exasperated sigh. granted, i'm aware that caseworkers are swamped. so i sent in all documents i reasoned she would possibly need to make a determination. i called the main office a week later to verify that all docs were received and they were and entered in my case file.

a few days later, **my recert case was approved**.

&#x200b;

then a few days later i get a letter from an investigator in the verification unit asking for the same set of documents already submitted. the letter was dated a day before my recert case was approved. so i call the investigator and he says to just send him everything i sent my caseworker. so i did.

&#x200b;

**questions**:

* is it the caseworker who flagged my case for an investigator? (possibly out of spite for being rebuked by the supervisor and being proven wrong about  false assertions about me). if not the caseworker, then who or what flagged my case for investigation?

&#x200b;

* since i have nothing to hide, i sent the investigator everything he asked for and some extra to further back up my documents since the letter said i had until april 2nd. will this come back to bite me and cause more unnecessary frustration?

&#x200b;

* how will i know when the investigation is over? when will it end or be closed?

&#x200b;

and thank you in advance for any insight into this.

hi all.

here's a doozy. i was denied snap benefits at my latest re-certification because it was alleged that i have a business that i do not own, didn't start and do not participate in.

i asked in a letter/fax where this information came from and to please furnish me with a copy. it took them 3 weeks to send me an except from a lexisnexis accurint report that lists a business that started in 2020 at the address i reside at. it doesn't attach the business to me/my name, only to my address. the worker who sent it tried to redact a portion of it but when held up to the light, says that there were no filings associated with this business.

again, i have no knowledge of this business of any kind.

i sent a notarized letter attesting to the fact that i do not have any interest, ownership, participation or knowledge in this business. i even sent my own personal lexisnexus report that does not list any business of any kind.

my taxes from 2020 and 2021 that i sent also do not have any business of that kind on it. just my landscaping and scrap metal oddjobs. my bank statements of a full year that i sent also do not in any way reflect that business in question.

here's the kicker: the worker said that i have this business which she believes is an internet businessand that many people started internet businesses during the pandemic. she then asks for proof that the business is defunct. this is an illogical and impossible request since it would be asking me to prove a negative.

i asked for a supervisor and sent a letter asking for a supervisor to intervene. never heard anything back. also asked for an agency conference but never heard back and when i called and spoke to a live person they said they wouldn't grant one but that i should request a hearing instead. so i requested a fair hearing.

i live with another adult family member but have always stated factually that i buy and prepare my own meals.

i believe this started because the case worker on this latest recertification may have noticed at the time that i had over $1000 in benefits left. but that surplus has been there for more than a year but i have been exhausting most of each monthly benefit and that balance stayed more or less the same for almost a year. thanks to the extra pandemic benefit of $95.

when i reapplied with a new application recently while waiting for my fair hearing, this issue is coming up again. why? this time they are asking for proof from irs and state regarding the status of the business in question. i told them that it is impossible for me to obtain something i have no affiliation with and to please refer to my notarized statement.

what is going on?

no investigator ever called or showed up. and this issue has been going on since june. can't see why an investigator would bother with this since no kids and no fraud is at work. and an investigator can easily look up on state register for any llc or inc. i did, and no such business exists. if a sole proprietorship, then it would reflect in my taxes which it doesn't. so why are my consistent statements about this alleged business being ignored?

how do i possibly satisfy this issue on their part?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

update: 10/30/22

so on saturday morning (10/29), i was checking to see the status of my current snap application online and to my surprise, it said, ""approved."" 

&#x200b;

but here's the kicker: when i went to check my snap balance, not only did i get the prorated portion from this month (starting from day of the approved application), but also for august and september including the pandemic $95 for each month. 

i think the person preparing the evidence packet for my hearing on nov 2, looked at the situation and realized the error made by the previous caseworker. 

&#x200b;

i guess my fair hearing is moot now. if i get a letter in the mail by tuesday stating the reasoning why they decided to go back and add the 2 months for which my fair hearing is concerned, i will cancel/withdraw my hearing request. otherwise, i will have to go forward with it and if the agency decides to withdraw (which by this action already suggests they have), i happily would agree. 

i don't know who to thank at the agency, be it my current caseworker who i had before and she was a gem, or an unnamed supervisor. so i'll just thank them all. it's a hard thankless job. 

&#x200b;

and thanks to everyone who took the time to reply and to read. "

after 10 minutes an intake rep listened to the situation and said mom should help son reapply instead of follow up with an appeal but in his opinion the son shouldn't receive any benefits because he isn't elderly and disabled and told the mom to reapply immediately but that he was confident her son wouldn't qualify because he wasn't elderly. mom explained that the son prepared his food with his personal aide that is provided through the regional center and the rep told her this didn't matter because he was young. this rep was rude and disrespectful to the mom so the mom just thanked him and ended the call. now she is discouraged and doesn't know what to do. 

should she appeal or reapply?

"isolated and homebound elderly are facing food insecurity the post-emergency allotment world (maryland) is hurting the unseen and forgotten.
a poverty level income and not enough deductions means they receive minimum benefits. 
the cola is not enough to offset the high cost of groceries, etc. 
they must rely on grocery delivery, which is very expensive. amazon fresh is no longer affordable, and the other options are worse.
we need to do much better.

"another question (upstate ny not new york city) | question. nys | questions about snap process hello everyone so i recently made a post concerning my snap case, earlier this week i finallygot ahold of the lady who did my interviewand she saidshe found my documentsi sent in and that they would be workingon my case soon and it was now out of her hands. i just called the call center just to see if there was an update on my case and the call center told me she now sees a budget? and that they are working on my case. just wondering if that was a good thing? i'm just really hoping i get benefits very soon i have no food so this is why i'm curious. thanks to anyone that could put a little insight of the timeline this if possible.

is it possible to see benefits before even receiving a approval letter? (if i was approved)

hi so i applied the beginning of august week later got phone interview 2 days later sent in all required documents. called for about a week to see if they received them no answers and call center said nothing was changed on my case. finally got ahold of the actual case worker who gave me the phone interview and she said she couldn't find anything so she said she would look and call me back. she calls back left a message saying she did receive all the documents and that now it was out of her hands. i'm not quite sure what that means? is this a good sign? i don't know the process after they received my documents. i'm sorry for the long post but this has been so frustrating due to me doing a recertification in june and waiting over 35 days just to tell me i was denied and having me reapply all over in august. thanks.

my question is will they still give us assistance of any kind ? ebt ? cash aid ? insurance ? we are reporting it all today the income . got first check and are just over the irt . or are we gonna lost all the assistance? that would suck 😭 cause now working full time and still am not making more than the cash aid and ebt combined. so if they take everything that'll be really terrible 😔"
"recertifying for snap as graduate student (ny) i qualified for snap through the covid exemption as a med student and they're going to end in 2ish months. i had a question about what i can possibly say during the interview to extend my benefits for another year as snap has drastically changed my life- not going to bed hungry has been a huge game changer and allows me to focus on my education :') .... i did have a full-time job over the summer (and have documentation of this work) and wonder if i could average out what i made during that time to say i had at least a part time job for the summer and had just recently ""lost"" it and that i was looking for another job alternative (e.g. babysitting). 

doing the full 20 hours each week would most likely not be possible given school but wondering what ya'll think? the thought of taking out loans just to get groceries is so dystopian to me and there's no way for me to work during the school year."

""have you been to new york? “ no, i have definitely not gone to new york... 
turns out someone has hacked my account, transferring it all through /into ""moonlight candy plus"" in ny-ny. 
while getting the information i need on how to proceed, she told me that since the 29th of august, they have been aware of mass fraud in the ebt system, thousands of accounts being hacked but they don't know how. she told me that they were putting into place something to help people get their money back. i couldn't get any more information than that. 
had to file a fraud report with local police then take that to dss. 
how is it that their system is so weak to hacking? this has to be a vulnerability in their tech, their database or servers, right? 
well, there are a lot of people that are going to struggle even more these next few weeks because of their lack of security.

"question | i’m so fed up | it’s officially been three months since my application. i’m fed up. | filed a complaint today | cant wait any longer. | why is it taking so long??? hello i’m in texas and after 5 months, finally was approved for snap. it says the start date was may 2nd and i got my snap benefits but it says i get it in the 20th of the month. so my question is will i get more on may 20th? was that the benefits for april or may?

absolutely sick and tired of calling everyday and going into the office only for them to tell me they’re “working on it in the order it was received.” it’s been freaking 4 months. i’m 35 weeks pregnant and can’t wait any longer. i’ve had it escalated and out in a complaint, even a new application. nothing. i guess i won’t be getting help from these people when i have $0. i’m done. i don’t know what else i can do. i’m in texas.

it is still pending because no one has looked at it still. i call everyday and they said since i put in a complaint someone should be looking at it within about a week now. i’m so sick of waiting and just wanna be able to buy groceries. no food banks will help me. i’m so fed up with waiting. i’m in texas.

do the complaints actually help them look at it finally? my benefits have been pending and it turns out it’s because it’s been escalated but no one has looked at it. i’m in texas.

i’m currently 32 weeks pregnant. i put in my application for food stamps on january 9th. i’ve sent it every document they’ve needed. it’s now almost march 22, and my status is still saying pending even though it was supposed to be escalated. do i need to put in another application? i’m in texas.

"i give up on getting my benefits | does nc not care about people on benefits? | fns time limit rules & abawds | snap account suddenly closed | changing ebt pin state: north carolina 
county: mecklenburg

i was able to talk to a supervisor and what i gathered from the conversation is that is my fault i am not receiving benefits, that i should have known about the website to submit documents that i've never heard of and was not told about, and that even though i followed the instructions on the income form to fill out i didn't do it right. i was told i could always reapply but this has drained me and doesn't seem worth it, even though i submitted appeals as well. thanks for all the help and advice you all gave me but i'm done. this has taken on toll on my mental health and right now the cons out way the pros. i rather struggle.

state: north carolina 
county: mecklenburg

small update: just got off the phone with someone, i called as soon as they opened, and they said their supervisor would call me by the end of the day. i asked for what reason and she said just to make sure everything was correct. i doubt i will get the call so i'll try and go to the office this afternoon.

i posted last month about not receiving my benefits and how my conversation went with the office. i never received my benefits, they never called me back like they said they would, i received nothing in the mail, and my documents most likely haven't been processed yet. i guess it's my fault for not calling more frequently to make sure they were on top of it. how am i still approved yet i'm not receiving any of my benefits? it's at the point where i want to give up on food stamps and cry. i hate how i don't have a specific caseworker but whoever is available at the time, especially when they don't care & you can obviously tell.

sorry for my rant.

state & county: north carolina, mecklenburg

i just got the time limit rules information in the mail and i have a question. for my income, i dog-sit my brother’s dog 5-6 days a week and he pays me every other week & i also have a small online business (very new/unprofitable at the moment) so that's how i'm making it. when i had my phone interview i told the casework and scent proof of my brother paying me and my etsy profits. so my question is do i need to get another job to stay on benefits?

background info: my brother's dog is a rescue and hates other dogs and has abandonment issues and will cry if she is left alone which is why i watch her. i basically watch her when he is working and when he goes out. i'm definitely cheaper then if he were to hire a professional.

state: north carolina

i called to confirm that i was getting my benefits tomorrow (every 5th) but the person on the line said my case is closed for this month till november. i don't understand what happened to my account, i submitted all of the documents required on epass and was told my benefits would be till nov. when i would have to reapply. my program still says approved on the website, but i'm not. the lady wasn't really helpful at all and said someone will call me this weekend or next week. i understand that they are backed up but i was really counting on the $281 tomorrow. 

has this happened to anyone else? i'm not sure what to do, i only have about a dollar on my ebt card now.

update: i tried calling again and the automatic voice hung up on me.

update 2: i was able to talk to ppl who actually knew what they were doing, my case isn't closed but i won't be getting my benefits on my scheduled day. i will most likely get my benefits 3  business days after they process my documents on monday. i can't help but think if i had talked to one of the people who knew what to do this morning i could have still got my scheduled benefits instead having to wait till almost the end of next week.

"new jersey snap after switching from pa during pregnancy hello!

i just moved from pa to nj. i was on snap last year in pa and was due to receive snap (spoke to a pa case worker) after reapplying after my work termination and pregnancy. i didn't refill out an application because i moved and would have to close benefits. i just closed my pa medicaid. 

anyway, i just applied today for nj snap & familyfirst after being unemployed for a month and pregnant for a few months. after finishing my application it does not appear i will be immediately eligible for benefits. my biggest concern is *why*? i know they'll tell me during the denial letter. 

(1) i receive unemployment from nj that puts me over the income limit for a single person household but i was under the assumption that being pregnant increased the % over the poverty level. is this not true? (2) my unemployment benefits barely cover my expenses for the month including rent, electric, car, student loan, etc. which nets me negative for the month and that does not include food. because of this, i have been pulling out of my savings/checking which is around 10k combined. do these resources count in nj? (3) while i am not immediately ""disabled"" and prevented from working, i unfortunately was fired at no fault of my own (likely for being pregnant 🙄) and looking for comparable work but it has been difficult. i am in a lapse in medical coverage from pa medicaid to nj medicaid program but will have my new doctor deem me ""disabled"" due to pregnancy woes, flare up of a physical disability i was diagnosed with years prior (no ssi/disability payments) and mental trama. i don't think me not meeting the 30 hours work requirement is really what is preventing me from receiving benefits here in nj (since i was due to be elegible in pa after being fired) but is this what is affecting me? 

i'd be grateful for any insight from caseworkers who float around on the sub reddit. i guess overall i'm having a lot of anxiety i've never experienced before with being a new mom and not being able to truly focus on the baby and just ""being okay"" 🙁"

"anyone in los angeles that didn't get the emergency allotment that was scheduled for literally today? according to this form, calsaws counties (of which los angeles county is part of) are supposed to get the extra $95 *today*. it usually comes on almost immediately after midnight, so i'm kind of concerned because it's 8 in the morning and i still don't have it.

i know it's supposed to be the 2nd to last emergency allotment (march is the last month we're getting the $95 in california).


i can confirm that i am *not* due for a recertification. even *if* i was, i would still get the extra $95 (because i *still got it* when i had to recertify last year; the recertification did not delay or ""cancel"" the extra $95).

and, it was denied because they did not receive the requested information.. even though i faxed it. 3 times. 

i called and the guy said i could go on the access account and just upload the documents, no need to make a new application. i go, huh i must have missed that option to upload stuff.

i go on and check, and i do not have any option to upload documents anywhere. i called again today to ask why.. i have a case number and everything, and the lady said i have to apply all over again? even tho this letter says i have 30 days to provide the documents. she said i can’t upload anything because my case was denied because i failed to provide the documents.

i’m short, i recently realized i made some reporting errors during the pandemic and now believe i have been overpaid some of my snap benefits. realizing this has been distressing and obviously i want to correct this!!! my situation and how this happened is complicated and i think will require an extended conversation with my case worker. i also want to make sure i understand my case.

due to my mental health diagnosis, it’s very hard to have this kind of conversation over the phone. is it realistic to think jfs would accommodate me to schedule an in-person appt with a case worker? i have a support person who i will need to be present with me. is that allowed? what should i say when i call?

overall, i’ve had a pretty traumatic experience with jfs and have been very anxious about interacting with them about this, but i want to get these issues resolved. i just don’t know how to approach it or what to expect.

il work requirements hi guys i am (25f) starting grad school next week. i am in an accelerated program and will be required to complete an internship. while i am considered an abawd i am currently unemployed and planned to remain unemployed while completing my program. i worked full time while in undergrad and had an internship it was just too much to handle physically & mentally. im a bit confused as to whether or not il requires min 20 hrs of work per week to qualify for snap at this time? i share a home w my partner who is only working about 29 hrs per week

"cal fresh overpayment. hope this is a good place to ask this, so a few weeks ago we got charged by cal fresh for $1600 for overpayment, because we ""don't need it"". so we where getting ready to pay that back.

today we received a noticed thay they processed another cal fresh application (i guess they where reviewing our account) and they deposited $1500 into our account.

so my question is, does this make any sense to anyone? how can we owe $1600 bc we don't need it yet get $1500 because we need it?"
"overissuance for entire year when only working 10 weeks (ca) i was a student who was on calfresh during my time in school, as permitted under the program’s extension to students. 

during the summer, i worked at a paid externship for 10 weeks. i timely reported my income. my pay there put me over the income eligibility, but my county (by their own admission) made an administrative error and continued to let me receive benefits. to note, although i was receiving payment for only 10 weeks, the pay was significant; if pro-rated over the entire year as annual income, it may have put me over for the entire year. but to be abundantly clear, i was only receiving income for 10 weeks. 

1 year later, the county sent me an overissuance for the entire year, including the 42 weeks of the year in which i was not working nor receiving any income. 

i was told by a legal aid attorney that this is incorrect, and that my overissuance should have only accounted for the 10 weeks in which i was receiving income. the attorney told me that they would get back to me with citations affirming this, but they have since ghosted me. 

does anyone know the specific regulations that would apply to my situation? i want to have something i can cite to which clearly states that i should have only received an overissuance for the 10 weeks in which i was receiving income. 

thanks in advance."
"i don't know what to do (abawd). little income. | i'm so worried. i got notified that i could lose snap due to work requirements and i barely earn enough to survive. my state is ri.

i make average $900/month from self employment as an abawd. i am plagued with several yet to be fully diagnosed problems including high functioning asd, c-ptsd, and chronic depression/anxiety. to the point where even if i wanted to, i'd likely break from a panic attack in a full time ""real"" job. work from home is the only hope for me.

i can't get ssi or ssdi due to lack of years of history and may yet find something i can do, even if it's part time, in addition to my self employment. 

here's my question: is my income enough to meet the work exemption policy for abawds (80 hours per month federal minimum)? if my rent is a few hundred dollars, would that impact it at all? i feel like the snap calculator isn't accurate. i also have heating and cooling expenses.

apart from submitting my income documents and bank statements, is there anything else i need to do to make sure i won't be denied exemption? also, the abawd waiver is not applied to my town.

[ ri ]

i happen to live in one of the few parts of my state that didn't renew the snap waiver. (why couldn't the whole state extend the waiver?) i live with family due to the unrealistic prospect of affording my own place right now, far below the poverty line.

i've been receiving the maximum $281 1-person household benefit and it's been a lifesaver because without it i'd have little left for expenses and saving goals including a car.

due to complex circumstances that i won't go into too much detail with, i can basically mentally only handle self-employment online which is what i've done. i estimate it's $800 per month usually and can be unpredictable, so it could be less by a couple hundred dollars too.

putting aside mental health support i need, i am desperate to maintain my benefits to survive on my low income. i get no support from family (another long story, summary is narcissists).

i don't know what to say to snap or how to input this information. there is a website i can do this on. i saw on some other posts i found that people who make $1000 or around there can expect to get the 1 person max benefit.

this income is fully earned. there is one other factor which is occasional income from plasma donations which is given on a prepaid debit card. i am not sure how that factors in.

do i need to complete a form that certifies this self-employment income, give the amount? how do they calculate deductions and such, like rent? i also read that if you make the equivalent of 80 hours x federal min. wage, that qualifies, which is $580."
"canceling calfresh application / missing interview? i honestly had forgotten i even applied because it took my local office so long to get back to me. now i don’t need it, but my interview is scheduled for tomorrow. i have been trying to call to cancel my application but i literally cannot get anyone on the phone. if i purposely miss the interview, would my application/case be canceled? is there any consequences to not following up on my case? or should i just tell my case worker during the interview that i am no longer interested?

"benefits approved but.... texas

i was approved for benefits and when i got the call telling me i was approved, that said i would be receiving $1069 for that month and the month prior. they split it into two deposits and both were authorized at the same time, but only one has become available and that was on june 23. the other deposit still hasn't been made available and we need some more groceries. i'm not sure who to call or if i should wait and see if they become available when my monthly deposit comes in this month on the 20th. is it normal to take this long for benefits to be available?"

"ebt one time payment questions (nyc) i got approved for ebt about a week or so ago and currently waiting on my card. on the hra main page, i cannot access my detailed case information, but i can see that my enrollment status says one time payment, i’m assuming that this means that i will only receive 1 payment at all. is this the case? the last time i had ebt was over the pandemic, and it lasted for a a little over a year, so i’m a little confused by this status, and not being able to contact anyone or see my detailed info is contributing to this. i want to be able to update my case information if need be when tax season starts because i have had inconsistent income for most of 2022, and haven’t been able to feed myself on the tail end of the year.

been on hold for about 45 minutes and the online system has apparently been down for maintenance for 2 weeks ): please help!!

update: i reached out to some of my community and they explained to me that they experienced the same situation when trying to recertify their benefits a while back by starting a new application and keep doing it until they were able to get approved for a long term period. also apparently the website has been ‘under maintenance’ for months, no one has been picking up the phone, and ever since the city opened back up, it’s been more difficult to get benefits. most likely i’ll have do this this, which is frustrating. i think i’m going to continue updating this post so that anyone experiencing the same can refer to it. wish me luck yall!"

calfresh food stamps stolen my food stamps were stolen from massachusetts. this is the second time in less than a year my account has been compromised. in july 2022 my cash aid was stolen and never replaced. la county dpss needs better security. it's also a shame low income people are being targeted.

"reporting birth of a child & benefits, mi. | worried about benefit amount, mi. i’m due to give birth in two weeks, have an induction scheduled for 8/1 for health problems. my question is, we just did our recertification in july and our benefits are usually issued on the 10th of each month. if i give birth on 8/1 or 8/2 would that effect the benefit amount for august or would we see a change starting september? additionally i would also need to apply for medicaid for the baby too would i need to fill out and application for him or just add him to the case? thanks!

we’re a family of 3 and i’m currently not working but my husband is. he wasn’t working and was on unemployment in 2022 when we first applied  we were also only a household of 2 and then during recertification he began working about two weeks prior. he also changed his name before recertification happened and we provided documents of his name update such as new social security card, id, citizenship paper, name change, etc along with his paystubs reflecting that name.

after the recertification happened they increased our benefits which was confusing to me but i was assuming it’s because we’re a household of 3 now we currently get the max of 700 for 3 people. but since being in this group i’m seeing things that are worrying me such as maybe the case worker didn’t see us update his work on the recertification? because we pay 560 in mortgage and around another 400 in utilities such as water, heat and gas, electricity, cellphone(consumers energy is killing us with their 180$ bills). after reading all the horror stories about people getting overpayments and fraud investigations i was looking over the amount they listed as countable income on the determination it’s showing 0 and it confused me? 

my husband makes 900$ every two weeks before taxes and 1800$ a month before taxes. i know we qualify but i’m scared there’s an issue and they didn’t count his income. after taxes his take home amount a month is closer to 1520$

can anymore weigh in on if this amount is correct or should i contact my case worker again? i tried calling them a week ago and then a few times two weeks ago to ask about the amounts but nobody seems to answer"
what does not appliance status mean ? i live in a homeless shelter in nyc and i routinely meet with my case manger who is able to see my status for snap and cash assistance. it's been taking forever for them to approve me. i spoke to someone over the phone the other day and  regarding why the application was taking so long and they sent an email out and said they would respond within two weeks (around march 8th) . should i be worried or concerned? does this mean i've been rejected?

"question abotu a child turning 18 | utah - reimbursment proceedure and problems | skimming reimbursement question my family receives snap benefits in utah and has for a long time

we are also on housing, ssi and medicaidi

in mid march our son turns 18 - a full time student and on track to graduate (missing 2x .5 credits iirc)our son also works at a local taco bell

we were informed that with my son's income will put us over the income threshold of $1920 a month (this is supposed to change in march)when  this happens - we will be ineligible to receive snap benefits for the month of april and will have to have everything settled by may 31 or we are cut off until we reapply

in essence this means we have to move our son out of the house before he graduates if we want to survive for the 2 and 1/2 months until he graduates ..

or ....

we don't get snap benefits for that time period of 2&1/2 months with all the ramifications attached to that and have 5 days to get him moved out of the house before we are cut off and have to reapply entirely (may 26-may 31)

just curious if anyone else has had to deal with this and what your solutions were

and before anyone asks - no we do not have a backup stash - we were hit with a card skimmer on january 2nd and everything was wiped out

9/1/23 (today) was the date for the implementation of utah's plan for reimbursing skimming victims   


i was expecting money to be deposited into my account this morning based on my skimming incident back in january, when it did not show up i called workforce services at 8am to see what was going on,   


i was initially told that there is a federal form that they mail you, you fill it out and then submit it back, over the course of speaking to the agent we found out that there was a ""problem"" as the agent could not figure out how to request the form, after being put on hold while the agent tried to get answers - which he failed at (to no fault of his own) at which point i was told he would be calling me back after he found out more   


fast forward to 11am and he finally calls back, the unfortunate answer is dws implementation of the plan suffered a huge issue in that the form is not requestable at this time... the system simply doesn't have it, i was told that an error like this dws usually fixes within a day but we'll see    


i was told that as soon as he had acess to request the form he would contact me back with more answers   


 \---- this is my opinion and in no way fact, nor was i told anything that has led me to this conclusion ---  
so as of right now i'm expecting utah's reimbursement to take another 2 months(2 weeks to get the form / send it back + another 6 weeks for processing)  

as a victim of skimming at the beginning of the year i have been following the developments related to my case including the raid on the site in arizona that was tied to the theft ring that hit me  


my involvement in reporting the skimming, as well as offering advice on how to deal with it  is well documented on this sub  


on june 2nd utah's plan was approved by fns with an implementation date of 9/1/23  - which is today

a question for other states who's implantation dates have come before - - how did it actually happen ? was it a lump sum deposit on your cards ? did it come in batches ? did it actually show up on the date of implementation or was there a delay, was there some form of notification or not

obviously every state is going to be different but having an idea of how other states were done might be helpful to those who are still wafting

"dont know if this is allowed but wanted to vent about my states ebt right now? i sent in my review over a month ago (on time), and my benefits were cancelled because my dhhs office didnt process the paperwork on time. ive been calling every day trying to get ahold of them and theyre getting such a high number of calls that theyve just completely shut their phones off. this is just an insane thing to do to someone, take their food money away because you screwed up and werent able to do your job correctly on time? and food banks only allow people to go one week out of the month here plus with food allergies/a disability that only does so much. i knew i was barely going to be able to make it by without the extra funds because of high food prices, but now its all gone because of a screw up by the dhhs office."
"""missed"" the appointment i'm in florida

how did i miss the appointment? do they not check their voicemail at all before they determine this? cause it was stated on the answering machine to leave a voicemail if i'm calling for an appointment."

"benefits where cut by 60$ because my renewal happened to fall on a month with 3 paychecks. i work at a catering place, and my hours are determined by what events are booked for each week. sometimes we're really busy and i get a full week, and sometimes we don't have anything and my boss will make up cleaning shifts so i get enough to cover rent.

i always talk to someone in person and take about 4 months worth of pay stubs and explain to them how unstable my income is, it's never been a problem before. but since my renewal fell on november and i made an ""extra"" 200$ that month, they cut down my benefits. 

i got january and february's deposit yesterday, and knowing that it has to last until march (or possibly later), i'm really nervous about being shorted 120$. i'm pretty good with budgeting but most of the time this is literally all of my grocery money.

this month..i haven't seen that preload.

my case is in good standing and i recently completed my renewal in july, so i know its not a problem there(i have the state's customary two letters affirming approval).

"student meal plan question | louisiana - small delay due to technical difficulties | louisiana snap workers are working 6 days a week, ten hours a day at least to help. hey all. i am trying to do a little research about how each state handles the meal plans for students.

fns states that if a student receives over 50% of their daily meals through a meal plan, they are ineligible.

what constitutes received in your state? that they eat the meals or that they have the option to eat the meals?

if you had an interview scheduled today, you likely weren't called. our state is experiencing an outage, all systems for most agencies were down. we couldn't even access our email so we couldn't get information to make calls. the systems are still not back up, but it is anticipated to be working sometime tomorrow.

your interview is likely to be rescheduled or you can call into the call center and select the options to lead you to the missed interview queue. 

i know how stressful the process can be. let me know if you have any questions.

~~edit: still down this morning, we expect to be back up today~~

edit 2, electric boogaloo: it still broke. many other agencies were sent home, we don't really expect it to be back up today but are here just in case.

if they do stop/ lower my benefits because i am employed how do they determine how much i am making since i’m not even sure myself? and if they stop/ lower it and after a month i end up not staying at the job do i have to re apply or just notify them? 

i want to go back to work but i also need the help for food and based on childcare i’m not sure how much i can be working. i just don’t want be hit with sudden changes."
"so confused about self employment income form trying to get food stamps recertification in nevada 


i have a self employment income form that goes all the way back to august of last year. i’m supposed to fill out my daily income. my self employment is for a freelance work website. at the time i was making mostly $0 a day and occasionally a little bit of money, but i was mostly receiving financial help from 2 of my friends at the time.  do their consistent payments count as self employment income, all the way back to september? those payments mostly stopped around january. 

eta: i guess my question should be does self employment income in the last year mean all “income” in the last year? cash gifts etc?

every step of this has been so confusing and i can’t even get any one of my friends to fill out the rent/household form and even though i really need this money for food i am about to give up."
"oregon snap asset limits? hi everyone i’m doing americorps and i’ve been doing some research while filling out my snap application. as far as i’ve been told, americorps members qualify for the full benefits as long as we apply before our start date because it is a stipend, not income. the only question i have here is: is there an asset limit in or? i’ve found some relatively unofficial sources saying there are no asset limits but i’d like to confirm. i don’t have many assets but more than the small amount allotted by the general snap. i was already planning on putting some in my roth ira but i don’t want it to look like i’m trying to scam the system."
"(tx) college student, applied 2/9, uploaded requested information/documents | denied in tx; how to ask for appeal and what to say? | food stamps in texas as college student i am a college student who was living off my fafsa refund. i paid off my dorm & now have no money left. i don’t have any money and will need more groceries in about a week. i’ve been looking for jobs, as well as work study on campus ones but can’t find anything. i don’t wanna pull out a loan just to buy groceries. how can i maybe speed up the process for my approval or denial?

i’m a 19 year old full-time college student. i live away from my parents, pay my own rent, have no job because of how busy i am, and cannot really afford to buy many groceries except the bare minimum like water, eggs, bread, milk. i have no income and i have a roommate and i was denied for some reason. i had been approved for $281 a month and they had asked me to send in some paper work i could not get in on time, but i still sent it. i    was able to pay off my rent through my fafsa refund, and now have no money. what should i do, and how should i do it? thanks!

i applied last year on december 1 and was approved for $281 every 28th of the month. while on christmas break, i went back home and was mailed a form that i had to give to my landlord to fill out in order to prove i pay rent. it was due on jan 2nd and i didn’t come to college until jan 15th, so i was unable to have it filled out. i have no idea how to request for the papers to be sent again. should i email them? i’ve looked back on the case and it now says “in review.” i check card balance and all that’s on it is the money that came in the card when they mailed it to me, and it says i have no payments for the future. how do i fix all this? i’ve tried to call but never get past the automatic messages."
"pebt question texas hello, i have a quick question. i have 3 kiddos. 1 elementary, 1 3 yr old in early childhood school, 1 born in spring 2022. i only received pebt for my elementary. listening to the 211 automated system it says eligible born after 2015. am i supposed to submit an application for my younger 2?"
"help applying hi, it’s my first time doing this and i’m a little lost right now. i’m in pa and you have to register first to apply (create a profile i guess). i’m confused because on the registration form it asks for numbers that i don’t have and wouldn’t have until i have an ebt card and was receiving benefits already. how am i to obtain these (case numbers, mci/ebt, ufi/chip) without already receiving benefits? please help!"
"nys (would my roommates income disqualify me for foodstamps?) i had my interview today, i’m currently unemployed and only get $100 a week while staying with someone so i can’t really contribute a whole lot but do when i can. the woman on the phone asked me what the rent was and i said $1240, and i said i can’t really pay all of my half atm because i only get unemployment right now. would me not being able to pay for rent make it seem like i’m just living for free and wouldn’t need food stamps? they really helped me in the past and only having $100 a week to work with right now is a little hard to get everything i need."
"denied for snap in texas, but yourtexasbenefits account shows different. it was time for me to renew for only *my* medicaid in november. my husband and kids have renewals at different times, it’s weird haha
but, they wanted me to verify income and stuff by 11/21. i didn’t get the letter until the sunday before the 21st. i went to an office to turn it all in so it’d be faster, and she told me they’d probably kick me out of the system because it was technically too late to turn everything in. um…okay? i turned it in on the last day, but whatever. i figured i’d try it anyways and if they didn’t accept it for it being too late, i’d re-apply. well, they did choose to not accept my forms for employment verification because i was “too late” with my documents, but when i log in to my account, we all still have medicaid (my kids and husband until 9/23, and me until 6/23) and it says our snap (which is what they said we were denied for) doesn’t end until february 2023. so, can i still expect my regular deposits while i work on sending in my new application? should i even send in a new one if it seems like they didn’t even cancel our snap benefits? i already have a benefit authorization posted on the lone star card for december. i’m so confused with how they’re running things since covid started 🤦🏻‍♀️  they denied us for snap, but i was up for a medicaid renewal, so i’m very confused. i’d really appreciate any insight anyone may have, and can pm screenshots of what i’m talking about, if needed. thanks so much!

i don’t wanna call and ask someone at 211 because i’m afraid to bring it to their attention so they can really cancel it 😫"
"how to handle a situation. a quick introduction: i am in college, have a family of 3 soon to be 4, and i am currently the sole provider. i work at a common pizza place as a delivery driver and manage to cover our costs as we live independently. now we don't live lavish lives, but we have everything we need and enough space

my problem: in college, i am studying computer science and i am fortunate enough to have landed an internship for this summer to start sometime around may-june. i will be leaving my current job temporarily and i will make well above what my gross pay currently says is my limit. we have been getting food stamps for a while now and i am very grateful we can as this is how we manage without too much struggle. our recertification day just so happens to be june 1st. i don't know how i am supposed to go about this. do i  not recertify and then after my internship apply again? do i not mention this job and just recertify? do i call and give a heads-up or ask if i can be put on pause?

i would like to ask if just skipping recertification would be best if i don't want to have to get my internship to verify that i was only working there for a temporary period."
"new york food stamp question | new york snap question | new york hra | new york hra question | how to report school status when on loa? | new york fair fares question | new york snap i am currently waiting on my ebt card to come in the mail. can i walk into any snap office and request a temporary card?

recently applied for snap logged into the app and saw two payments. one said 
one time snap benefit for a full month and the other one said partial snap/food stamp’s benefits. what do these terms mean? and why is it two separate payments?

how exactly am i supposed to do my interview if they never answer the phone? its so frustrating and the call back feature doesn’t work.

how to report school status when on loa?

i am currently on leave of absence from school. however i am trying to apply for cash benefits what should i report my school status as: less than half time or not enrolled?

i am currently on leave of absence from school. however i am trying to apply for cash benefits what should i report my school status as: less than half time or not enrolled? i am in new york state btw.

i applied for the fair fares metro card and now the status says metro card issued. however i have not received any calls in the mail. i tried to call human resources administration and was on hold for an eternity then signed up for a call back which i never got. so if anyone has knowledge on fair fares do you know how long after the status changes to issued it’s supposed to take to arrive in the mail before i can consider it missing?

i never signed up for cash assistance but this morning i received a random $50 cash assistance payment. the description was heap. does anyone know  about this?

another question i have is since i didn’t add cash assistance to my application the first time is there away i can apply for cash assistance alone? when i try on the website it’s telling me that cash assistance and snap is a package deal giving me the impression that it can’t be applied for separately."
"how to get calfresh to do their fucking job i haven’t been scheduled to do an interview twice already both times i get on early and wait and the same guy answers everytime asks me if i need help with anything tells me his computer needs to restart and hangs up. 

this is fucking bull shit. county is yolo county in california have tried contacting them but no help."
"me and my partner are on calfresh and my status is discontinued but not my partners hi so i am a grad student and just got my salary, i called and asked to report my income change as well as provide my rent information since i am well over 50% of my paycheck for rent. after talking they said they'll update it. then the next day i notice i am discontinued but my partner is not.

it even shows the max amount still being provided for us. does this mean we still get benefits since her case is still active? i'm just a bit confused. i would have sworn that we'd still get benefits together given all the deductions on my salary considering rent and all. i'm still below the 200% limit. wondering if anybody had been in this situation or can offer advice or clarification, thanks!"

"deleted paypal account, will i be questioned? so my sar-7 was declined, said they need more proof/information, although i’ve had no income/living changes, i checked no on everything. i’m going to call them this upcoming week. i’m curious what could have been missing. but my main question here is, my paypal account, which is linked to my bank account and pops up on my bank statements from time to time, was deleted the other day because i got hacked and didn’t want to deal with any risk of compromise, even after a password change and two factor set up. i just decided to make a new one. i’ve submitted my bank statement in the past and my paypal was on it and they never asked for my paypal statements before, but i’m wondering if they will this time, and will they understand that i had to delete it or will they be able to retrieve information from it somehow. sorry if this is confusing! it’s pretty complicated of a question. im just trying to prepare for any questions they may send my way. thank you in advance!"
"monthly benefit went down i got a letter from the ebt office and instead of getting more ebt it actually was adjusted and went down at least $20.

with inflation hitting so hard i'm surprised they lowered it.  i think they are lowering payments across the board.

"benefitscal sucks it’s the most confusing site ever. alameda county just transitioned to it like a month ago and i hate it so much. it’s shows stuff from old cases from like a decade ago, it’s not as easy to see your forms or eletters, it’s not even visually appealing… my latest issue is that i submitted my sar7 through it for the first time, it shows up as “recieved” then i get a eletter 2 days later saying my worker “doesn’t have it” and now i don’t have my benefits. i thought i would have processed by now since i turned it in on a reasonable amount of time. i swear it’s like i have issues with these people every other month."

"ohio - monthly balance being boosted | how hard is it to get cash assistance? did anyone else get a letter for ohio ebt saying starting next month their balance would be raised by $10 jumping from $281 to $291? not much but i guess every penny counts in this case.

so i live in ohio i’m 28 still live at home i have 0 income and no kids or dependents or any work barriers other than no transportation. i was recently approved for snap/ebt back in may as long as i continue doing the 20 hours weekly work requirements. so anyways i was wondering what’s the process like applying for cash assistance are my approval odds high already just cause i’ve already been accepted for food stamps? my car is broken down and that’s the main reason i’m even wondering cause i was gonna put it all towards fixing it if i were to get approved."

"applied for snap at the end of feb., have card but no answers hey y'all, hope everyone's doing fine. i'm from texas and i applied for snap benefits on 2/28 since i had just had ankle surgery 2/17 and would be out of commission for a hot minute. i got my request for documentation and got it all in (in person at my local hhs if that's helpful info, my mother was the person physically turning things in for me) before march ended. got a lone star card in the mail 4/07, as i've learned is customary for first-time applicants by reading a few threads here i guess? activated the card, no active benefits, said the date i'll receive benefits is on my acceptance letter, there is no acceptance letter, cool cool. i call 211 on 4/12, explain the situation, the first person tells me i still have documentation to submit. i confirm with my mother that i don't. i call again, the second person tells me everything's squared away and submitted (i got epically trolled by the first person it seems 😞) so she'll escalate the application.

so yeah, still no change or movement whatsoever, which is unfortunate seeing as how ebt applications usually have a decision declared in about a month or so, but i did hear everything's backed up and a hot boo boo mess even for people who actively receive benefits. i extend my apologies to everyone affected.

so what should i do? what should i expect? i've been checking daily and i don't know if my actions make me a busybody since i'm not too familiar with this process. if may rolls around and there's still nothing, would that be the best time to reach out, or would checking in once more before april ends be okay?"

i thought “i’ll apply for food stamps, get some help until i can get a job”- but every single time i tap something that says “apply for food stamps here!” it gives me some 30 part survey about college debt and medical trials, and then tries to send me to another website with the same thing.
i just need food. please.

"eligibility for food stamps for grad student in nyc hello, i was wondering if anyone can help me out and see if i qualify for food stamps in nyc.

my circumstances:
- will be full time grad student starting end of august
- efc 0, pell grant eligible 
- eligible for work study
- current working full time in texas right now but will quit and not be working when i move to nyc for grad school
- previously on food stamps in 2020/2021 in another state as an undergrad student 

how soon can i apply? 

my lease starts august 1 but i’ll probably quit my job august 4th. i plan on moving to nyc end of the month and would like to have food stamps already by then. i’m concerned i would have to find a work study job first, wait for 2-3 paystubs, and then apply. do they need paystubs or can i submit a letter from my employer or financial aid office? 

anything helps thank you!"
