15z4zk5,NC. Please check cards before using them.,"I'm angry just typing this..... 

We just received a letter from the state this morning indicating that ""due to the large number of cards that have been potentially compromised, a decision was made to reissue new cards to recipients whose cards were potentially compromised."" This was done WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION to the recipients affected. Those affected will have absolutely no access to their benefits until a new card is received and activated. We have no way to tell who was affected by this at the county level unless you call to find out why your card isn't working. The EBT call center is just as limited on this information as we are.

So, please check your card to ensure it is active before attempting to use it. If you find that you were affected by this, your new card should arrive within 3 to 7 business days. Please ensure that your mailing address is up to date with us otherwise the card would have been sent to the last known address.

If you're affected and have no food until the new card arrives, please contact your local office for a community resource list or call 211.",panbi94,1692799723.0,foodstamps

171g8ou,"(Montgomery County, OH) Requesting in-person appt with caseworker? Need advice on how to report inadvertent errors & ask questions about my case","Is it ever possible to get an in-person appt w/ your case worker at Ohio Dept of Jobs and Family Services (Montgomery County)?

I’m not even sure it’s the best option for my situation but I don’t know what else to do. I’m hoping any experts / caseworkers here might be able to help me figure out the best way to move forward. 

I’m short, I recently realized I made some reporting errors during the pandemic and now believe I have been overpaid some of my SNAP benefits. Realizing this has been distressing and obviously I want to correct this!!! My situation and how this happened is complicated and I think will require an extended conversation with my case worker. I also want to make sure I understand my case.

Due to my mental health diagnosis, it’s very hard to have this kind of conversation over the phone. Is it realistic to think JFS would accommodate me to schedule an in-person appt with a case worker? I have a support person who I will need to be present with me. Is that allowed? What should I say when I call?

Overall, I’ve had a pretty traumatic experience with JFS and have been very anxious about interacting with them about this, but I want to get these issues resolved. I just don’t know how to approach it or what to expect.

I appreciate any input and guidance.

PS- I’ve been learning so much from reading this sub and I really wish I’d found it a lot earlier. I just want to say thank you to the workers/experts here and others for being kind & helpful. Thank you for all you do.",why4281,1696608303.0,foodstamps

I have WIC. 

I was let go after maternity leave. I applied for unemployment but am currently appealing their denial judgement.

So far this year we have had an income of $21k, below what is needed for benefits. We had a nice savings built up and were living off of that, but that is now running out. 

Husband just got a job as a 1099 but onboarding told him it will take some time to generate work for him. Hopefully my husband makes money soon, with a paycheck as proof, so that we can qualify income wise. We have to wait a few weeks for work to ramp up. He couldn’t work until now due to a work injury but has now recovered. 

My question is regarding work - do all parties have to be actively working before even applying? Hopefully I get a job soon.

I have been waiting over 30 days as of yesterday since I submitted every single thing my caseworker said I needed way back in early September/late October. She warned me she was new but I am so incredibly furious with her at the moment that it is taking a LOT for me to not just report her. 

I have been surviving on only $30 a week for food for the past month. That's for me, my gf, and our cats. I have been throwing every single goddamned cent of unemployment at that rent balance I owed and every cent of my part time job has gone to other bills. 

When I noticed I was getting close to the 30 day mark I lost my patience and submitted a message to my caseworker via the online portal for my state. We can't leave messages for our caseworkers usually and there is zero way to directly connect with them on the phone. I currently have no phone service, I literally have nothing on because I can't pay for anything other than this massive rent balance to avoid eviction and the electric bill. I walked to a nearby store, connected to the wifi, wrote up a note on my phone like an email asking what else I was waiting for as my case had been silent since day 1 and I submitted every single thing she asked for way back towards the tail end of August/very beginning of September. I attached it as an uploadable document and sent it, hoping for an apology maybe? An explanation? Anything?

She wrote me back today to tell me, she messed up, she needs MORE info from me ....I stopped reading after that.

16ywx9h,"Parents’ food stamps rejected, mom is ending work next year- can we reapply?","My dad has been retired for a while because of cancer and leg pains but somehow keeps getting denied disability whenever we tried so we stopped trying. They rely on food stamps and Medicaid/Medicare. My mom just reached retirement age and went on retirement as well. But my parents’ combined retirement income is just too little to survive plus the factory my mom works at had trouble hiring and asked my mom to stay to the end of the year. She thought this will help with money but it ended up hurting. 

We got the recertification letter in august and recertified. Their income is too high by the smallest margin and they were denied. We live in NYC and everything is out of control expensive. 

My question is - is there anything else they can do? Working disqualifies them but not working is not enough either. Come January, my mom will stop working - can we immediately reapply for food stamps then? Will this denial of food stamps affect their Medicare/Medicaid? My dad has very frequent doctor visits for his cancer (remission) follow up so they can’t lose medical. My mom also has a host of health issues and need that medical care as well.

16zc3hn,"(CA) 2 months ago, my EBT were benefits stolen via card skimmer...","(California, Riverside County) 
Long story short, my SNAP EBT balance was stolen via a card skimmer. It occurred on the day my benefits were dispersed, which occurred at midnight. By 6 AM the same day, my entire balance for the month was gone. I quickly discovered the theft because my transactions at the grocery store continued to get declined. 

I followed all the proper protocols for when this happens and filed out a report at the local social services office. The worker who assisted me stated that this was a genuine case of electronic theft almost certainly likely due to a card skimmer. 

On the forms I filled out it stated I could be made whole again within a certain (implied short) timeframe considering I took all the necessary steps. That was at the beginning of August, that month I lost about 10 pounds due to being unable to have adequate food intake. The date of me writing this post is October 3rd, when can I expect to receive back the benefits that were stolen at no fault of my own?*

*I believe the state is partially to blame for the recent spike of EBT theft. If it were not due to antiquated security features (or lack thereof entirely) on the EBT cards issued by the state, I believe many of the incidences today could have been prevented. 

Side complaint just to get off my chest: I was given a major bout of attitude by a different county worker who said that I didn't qualify for the county food pantry option as it was only for those with extreme food insecurity and facing special circumstances. How I apparently didn't qualify as someone who's homeless, jobless, and entirely without money is beyond me that I didn't meet the criteria. I think it's abhorrent how they had me make the long trip on foot 3 days in a row in the middle of the over 100° heat wave and starving to tell me this. Before it's asked, yes I had to go in person because neither my social worker will answer the phone, the operator doesn't seem to exist, and any other phone number for the county office doesn't work.",sympathetic_comment,1696388886.0,foodstamps

16xnuvz,Applying for SNAP has become utterly pointless,"My father retired and I helped set him up to apply for food stamps so that he can receive benefits. They’re giving him only $23 a month. 

This is a man who has worked since a teenager and retired nearing 70. He’s been working minimum wage all his life. Sacrificing his body to provide. What does the program do? Give $23 in food assistance in a country where food has become a luxury than a necessity. 

What the hell is this? 

I’ve read some people getting $200+ a month for food assistance, but I can’t seem to understand HOW. 

If you have a household of 4 people, why give $23? If you only apply with a household of 1 person, why is it still $23? 

It’s a broken system. And let’s say you have 4 people in the household. 2 of them (kids ages 18+) end up getting letters saying they need to participate in some E&T program. A program that’s mandatory to serve 80 hours a month in order to keep the food assistance of $200+. 

Like what? Those kids are in college or just live there. Why does it matter? Why does it also matter if the father is using food assistance to continue to provide his family? He’s retired. He needs the help. How else is he going to get money aside from what he gets from retirement that is ALL used to pay BILLS?

16x3b6f,Rejected in NYC for earned income,"My loved one has been on public assistance for a long time collecting cash assistance, snap and medicaid (which is the most important). He missed a recertification date due to moving issues and sent in needed documents at end of July. So finally he got a one time  deposit in September representing past month aka August. However now he gets this rejection notice for earned income. He's only had one temp on the books job in September making 1170 total which I thought was below the income limits for help? Obviously he did not report this income because his application to recertify was still being processed from back in end of July. Any insight on how temp income can affect these application? All the income limits I find seem to imply he would be eligible for Medicaid at least still. Any idea what he should do? Also does anyone know what income the state can detect?

16whcdi,Still No Food Stamps (2 Months Now),"Hey, I posted earlier this month about my NYC foodstamps/cash assistance case. I did my  recertification in July, got stamps in August, yet nothing for September and now no pending food stamps for October. 

To recap, I went in person, waited for the supervisor, they were dismissive and told me someone would do it by that afternoon and I would get my food stamps by the end of the week. 

I have called 3 times now to the HRA call center to complain, they said they were going to escalate it to the supervisor & contact the center. Tomorrow is Sunday, I have no food stamp payment for the month of October. 

I am also worried I won’t get backpay of the food stamps I didn’t get for September. 

I still get the cash assistance tho, but it’s literally $150 for 2 weeks, and I usually use that for my light & internet bill (which I am now behind on) but now I have used it for my daughter’s almond milk (she’s 1 and has a milk allergy) and her dairy free yogurt & “cheeses” in order to be able to feed her. 

I have resorted to posting all my personal items i,e: my laptop, ipad, bf’s game console & etc for sale in order to make ends meet. 

My case says it’s active for cash assistance, food stamps & medicaid. But the recertification hasn’t been updated to the next 6 months. 

Any caseworkers/similar situations have any suggestions on what else to do? I want to go again in person on Monday, but I am feeling hopeless at this point. Haven’t been eating, running low on milk again, getting desperate now.. TYIA 😟🩷",acrobatic-ad-8460,1696106626.0,foodstamps

16vyamj,DSS/SNAP claiming my income is double what it is,"Hello, I am self employed and on SSDI, and I get SNAP in CT.When I did a recent income verification I sent in my 2022 tax return.

I recently got some paperwork from DSS about the SNAP increase, and in the letter they are saying my income is XXX (2x what it is). I looked and the figure they are referencing is from my Schedule C - Business Income, called ""Gross Income"". (Schedule C line 7).

Again, this number is pulled from my Schedule C - Profit or Loss. By using that gross income figure they are not taking into account any of my itemized business deductions listed in detail below that line.I spend business expenses / deductions to run the business and that money is not mine.

Everyone I know, knows that business income = gross business income - expenses.

Edited to add: ""gross adjusted income"" is Form 1040, line 11 and that is the correct number.

Unfortunately we aren't assigned ""caseworkers"" here, and calling is not so much of an option (5 hour wait).

16vucns,Do I have to report my college scholarship refund as income when applying for SNAP benefits?,"Hello, I am a 21 y/o full time college student working 15 hours part time every week. I live with my partner (none of our expenses are shared) and I am trying to apply for SNAP in Nevada. This is my second time applying for SNAP. I was denied because my income at the time was too high (I was working full-time then). 

My main concern this time is the refund I received from my college scholarships. These scholarships are not federal grants, but were awarded to me strictly on merit. I worked very hard to gain these scholarships and they are the reason why I can even afford to go to school. I go to community college, and this semester I was awarded a fairly high amount due to me taking a gap sem to work full time (award rolled over to this sem). After my tuition and fees were covered, I was left with about a $3000 refund.

I am thankful for this money, but most of it will be going towards rent, living expenses and transportation as I navigate this semester. My income as a part time worker is barely enough for me to survive. Additionally, I know that I will barely have a refund next semester, so I am trying to salvage as much of the $3000 as I can so I can continue to go to school full-time. 

Anyway, I mention all this because I know that we have to report our income/how much we currently have in our bank accounts. I have my regular checking account, which has about $400-500 in it right now. However, I have another bank account. This account's *sole* purpose is to house my scholarship money so I don't go spending it willy-nilly (out of sight, out of mind). That account has about $2500 in it right now. 

My questions are:

1. Do I have to report my $3000 scholarship refund as income when I apply for SNAP benefits?
2. Do I have to report the other account that holds my scholarship money when they ask me about my bank accounts?
3. If I have to do either or both of these things, will this disqualify me from receiving SNAP benefits?

I'm really stuck right now. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you so much :)",meowmeowmeowmeow345,1696038833.0,foodstamps
16vs3hv,Investigation (PA),"I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve been receiving Medicaid since Dec/Jan of 2022. I applied because I was pregnant and needed help with co-pays. My primary insurance comes from my job. I also applied for food stamps but got denied but they told me I can try again when I got on maternity leave since I’ll be on STD. Fast forward to July (gave birth in June) and I applied for SNAP and got approved for $135 starting sept but were giving me $211 to cover July and august . I didn’t use the benefits until late August after going in person to get a EBT card since they never sent one. I spent the $211.  

Now I get a call from an investigator (OSIG)earlier this month saying that he stopped by my place to talk but no one was around and then told me I was being investigated. My caseworker wanted to verify if my newborn’s father was living with me. We’re together but not on the best of terms. I told the investigator he comes and goes, which is true. I asked him if I needed to add him on my case even though he’s not always here and he said not necessarily. Long story short, he asked me for a copy of my lease (they had my old one, I upgraded to a two bedroom in April to prepare for the baby’s arrival) and his ID. I send them both. My son’s father is not on the lease. Address on the ID is different but it’s expired. Boyfriend has not updated his information in the past year. He stays with family and friends because he is a independent contractor and travels for work. There was a period of time where he was working for someone and I allowed him to use my address. I told the investigator that he also pays my rent to help me since I’m literally on my own but I messed up and didn’t report that. I didn’t think that was income because I wasn’t “seeing” the money since it would go straight to paying rent and I can prove that with my bank statements. I have no friends and family here. I also told the investigator that when the baby was born he stood with me for two months to help me out. Investigator said he understood and he wasn’t going to report thatbut I don’t believe him. He asked me if my bf gets any mail, I said just one credit card statement but that’s it. And that was the end of the call. 

He called back to ask about my bf’s ID I said I know he hasn’t renewed it because he had tickets he needed to take care of and the investigator named a couple of addresses my bf lived in but I only recognized one but he no longer lives there. He asked for my bf’s number and I gave it to him.
He called him and asked where does he stay he said he stays with friends and family and said he can use dad’s address. Investigator took his dad’s address and said “we should be good but if he needed anything he would call back.” And I forgot I put down that I was working less hours because I was on maternity leave but I was still getting paid. I thought when they call me for an interview, I can explain everything but I never got one. They also never asked me to submit any documents. I applied in July and got a letter in August that I was approved. 

I’ve been worried sick. I can’t sleep,
I barely eat. Everything online says I’m going to jail. I called CAO and there’s no update. One person who was a bit helpful said they didn’t know I was being investigated because there was nothing on my file that looked fraudulent or said I was being investigated but asked me to send a copy of my lease and a letter from my bf saying he pays rent and he doesn’t live with me. I told him I send that to the investigator and he said there wasn’t anything on file. I send that in along with a letter saying I wanted to close my case. I’ll reapply once this matter is dealt with. I saw my FS increased to 177 for Oct and I panicked and closed the case. I don’t want them to keep sending me benefits. And the FS for Sept are still sitting in my card. Two weeks later,  I call today and again no update. Only that I closed my case and that a investigator spoke to me about my son’s father. How fucked am I? I’m so worried. I just gave birth.

I make average $900/month from self employment as an ABAWD. I am plagued with several yet to be fully diagnosed problems including high functioning ASD, C-PTSD, and chronic depression/anxiety. To the point where even if I wanted to, I'd likely break from a panic attack in a full time ""real"" job. Work from home is the only hope for me.

I can't get SSI or SSDI due to lack of years of history and may yet find something I can do, even if it's part time, in addition to my self employment. 

Here's my question: is my income enough to meet the work exemption policy for ABAWDs (80 hours per month federal minimum)? If my rent is a few hundred dollars, would that impact it at all? I feel like the SNAP calculator isn't accurate. I also have heating and cooling expenses.

Apart from submitting my income documents and bank statements, is there anything else I need to do to make sure I won't be denied exemption? Also, the ABAWD waiver is not applied to my town.",windeu,1696018684.0,foodstamps

The problem is on the application I put down the costs of all of my utilities and rent that I have been paying (and will continue with the little savings I have for as long as I can) but I live with my boyfriend and after I need some help with finances, he’s going to take on more of these costs until I find a new job.

I’m hoping to find a job soon but needed to get some help for my mental health, and with the work experience I have I might make little enough even at a next job to qualify for a lesser amount.

Well I received a notice today telling me that the person(s) below was denied for food assistance. It had my boyfriend name under it but not mine. They stated he makes too much income. But this makes no sense because I had just signed up back in July and was accepted and his pay has not changed and it makes no sense at all how we are denied now especially now that my pay was lowered I am in need of this even more now. I’m pretty sure this means I am denied as well ? How do I dispute this ? I am going to call them tomorrow morning and hopefully I can get through to them before work. I am so upset with this and I feel either maybe I made a error on my application or they had made a error on their end. Has this happened to anyone else ?

16s4q8p,SNAP benefits reduced by more than half,"Ever since my husband passed away and I lost my job (2 months after his passing) last year, I decided to apply for California SNAP Benefits and Medi-Cal. I have never applied for any of these program before and therefore don't know how they work.  I was granted both. My SNAP monthly benefit amount was $740 and it had remained the same until I had to recertification last week- it dropped significantly to $256 for a 3 person household. Nothing has changed except that I started receiving monthly death benefits from my late husband's pension plan in the amount of $1170, plus a monthly $942 from SSA for Survivor Benefits. Obviously, they take into account what I pay for mortgage and utilities. 2 family members live in my house and help me pay for my mortgage, otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford it. But when verifying they asked me if I charge them rent or if they help me pay for my mortgage... to me it's all the same since I use their money towards my mortgage. But,  apparently it has to do with how they account for that money. For example, if I charge them rent that money now goes towards my income. However, if they help me pay the mortgage that money is deducted from my expenses and not counted as income. Also, when I went into the office the rep mentioned something that i still couldn't wrap my head around; she said that to receive SNAP and Medi-Cal, it doesn't matter what i have in the bank or what property I own, that they solely go by the earned income (from a job). Does this hold any truth? Either way, I still didn't understand the logic behind any of what I just mentioned but I just know that my benefits were reduced significantly.

I wait about 10 minutes to get transferred to the right people, and explain this is the first time I have done this, I need to pay with EBT, do I come in somewhere? The lady says no I can do it over the phone, then asks me for my card AND PIN NUMBER. I tell her I'm okay with doing the card number over the phone but not so much the pin. And as I'm saying this I feel guilty like I'm accusing her of possible wrongdoing but for obvious reasons this just feels wrong. I ask if there is somewhere I can come in and do the transaction myself. She says no. So I give her the card and pin number (and changed the pin the second I got home). She says this is how they do it, and they write down the card and pin and after they use it they throw away the piece of paper ""in multiple trash cans."" Sounds like a safe system, right? What could possibly go wrong?

To top it off, as I'm waiting for my order after getting off the phone from giving the girl my card and pin number, I log into the EBT website and see the charge is $13  (approximately) more than what the online total was on my receipt. So when the order comes out, I ask the girl and she looks at me and says ""I don't know, I just work here."" A second girl (the one I apparently talked to on the phone who took my info) comes over and says ""you're the second person this has happened to. I don't know why it's doing that. Call tomorrow and talk to our manager and he will take care of it for you."" So I appreciate their honesty and after looking over the receipt and the order again I feel the receipt is right and the problem was somewhere with the website because some of the prices didn't make sense and I thought it should have been more and I figured that part out.

But what would you do about the whole ""give us your card and pin number"" over the phone situation? This is a major grocery store chain, not a little mom and pop operation. And so it can't just be there store that does this like this.

16qbuhz,Letting someone move in..IDAHO,"I am 67. My income is Social Security of $1107 and I receive $50 mo in Foodstamps and I also receive QMB medical assistance.

Times are really hard here, and I know of a 21 year old girl, a former foster child, who is really floundering in life. (Not my foster child). She only makes about $700 (net) per month at her fast food job, and of course that is not enough to pay rent, buy clothes or anything. She literally has two pairs of pants. She is currently couch surfing and pretty much going from one dangerous situation to the next. She is really trying hard to find another job but our local economy is just in the crapper right now.

I would like to take her in and let her stay in my spare room for no rent, maybe just help out with housework and chores.

I am obviously not going to be able to feed her on my $50 per month foodstamps, she will have to buy her own food and toiletries. But if we put both our incomes together, we would be over the foodstamps limit. She doesn't plan to ask for foodstamps, although I believe she still might have Medicaid for being a former foster child. Her asthma inhalers are being paid for by Medicaid.

Is there any way I can do this without losing my foodstamps and QMB? Cause I can not afford to cut my own throat to help someone else, but I would really like to help her out.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide.

He is ADHD and Autistic but not on any kind of disability.

If he applied for foodstamps would our income disqualify him?  I believe he is on Medicaid, his grandma has that information.

I called the main snap number 850-300-4323. System hangs up after 3 minutes. I've tried the virtual assistant, no go because it's AI. All it does is route me back to try using my account. I can't get through to anyone. 

Where can I go in person to get this taken care of?

16n4ulj,County Transfer Issues?,"I recently just transferred my SNAP benefits from Monterey County to San Bernardino County (CA). it took San Bernardino County around 2ish months to process all my paperwork and info so this month should’ve been my first month getting benefits from San Bernardino (I have been receiving Monterey benefits in the mean time). i’ve even gotten letters saying that my allotment has increased in San Bernardino. However, when I check my account on Cal benefits website, sometimes it shows the amount that I had left on my Monterey case and sometimes it shows my amount that I should’ve gotten from San Bernardino. And when I use my card in stores, it is only using my monterey money. The cal benefits website shows both my cases for for both counties, the Monterey, one being discontinued and the San Bernardino county being active. But as one previously mentioned, when I click on either balance it either shows the amount left in my Monterey case or the amount I should be getting from San Bernardino county, but the card I have from Monterey does not have what is supposed to be my allowance for this month. Am I supposed to be receiving a new card from San Bernardino county or are my benefits just not transferring over to my current card/case correctly and this is just a glitch in the system?",logo-01,1695163766.0,foodstamps

So I reported myself for the income and I received a letter stating SNAP benefits wants me to provide all kinds of information, even bank statements.
Obviously, I am willing to pay the money back. It’s near 2k of food stamps (up until now). I didn’t receive BAH in July, August or September. So as of July I would have qualified for food stamps.

16l4t44,I'm so worried. I got notified that I could lose SNAP due to work requirements and I barely earn enough to survive.,"[ RI ]

I happen to live in one of the few parts of my state that didn't renew the SNAP waiver. (Why couldn't the whole state extend the waiver?) I live with family due to the unrealistic prospect of affording my own place right now, far below the poverty line.

I've been receiving the maximum $281 1-person household benefit and it's been a lifesaver because without it I'd have little left for expenses and saving goals including a car.

Due to complex circumstances that I won't go into too much detail with, I can basically mentally only handle self-employment online which is what I've done. I estimate it's $800 per month usually and can be unpredictable, so it could be less by a couple hundred dollars too.

Putting aside mental health support I need, I am desperate to maintain my benefits to survive on my low income. I get no support from family (another long story, summary is narcissists).

I don't know what to say to SNAP or how to input this information. There is a website I can do this on. I saw on some other posts I found that people who make $1000 or around there can expect to get the 1 person max benefit.

This income is fully earned. There is one other factor which is occasional income from plasma donations which is given on a prepaid debit card. I am not sure how that factors in.

Do I need to complete a form that certifies this self-employment income, give the amount? How do they calculate deductions and such, like rent? I also read that if you make the equivalent of 80 hours x federal min. wage, that qualifies, which is $580.",windeu,1694967372.0,foodstamps

16kdzb9,CalFresh and federal shutdown,"If you're not a ""keeping up with the news"" sort of person, you may be unaware that Congress is currently fighting over next year's budget. The federal fiscal year starts October 1 - so Congress needs to agree on a budget (and Biden needs to sign it) before then, or different parts of the federal government stop working or making payments. 

The CA Dept of Social Services has announced that if Congress has not reached agreement on or before September 20, they intend to issue October's benefits a few days early to make sure they will be distributed without disruption due to the federal situation. They have requested permission from US Dept of Agriculture to make this early distribution but have not received a response yet. 

The letter is here:

https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/Additional-Resources/Letters-and-Notices/ACWDL/2023/CL_9-15-23.pdf?ver=2023-09-15-141520-273

TLDR: The plan is to issue all October continuing benefits on September 28 and 29. People will get their benefits early, but will not receive another benefit load until November. If the budget situation is not resolved in October it is not clear that $ will be available to fund benefits for November. 

Please keep in mind that this is a contingency plan, not something that's guaranteed to happen. Congress seems to play ""chicken"" with the budget every year and people getting freaked out seems to be part of the game. CDSS hasn't directed counties to make announcements to clients yet; but they've posted this on their public website, so it's not really a secret, either.

16iwqcl,"[Michigan] Caseworker sent employment verification forms, and spoke to my boss on the phone, what am I waiting for?","I'll try to keep it as short as possible but I applied for EBT here in Michigan after losing a job that paid well and having to take a job that pays less. My caseworker sent me Employment Verification forms for the job I lost and the job I gained. My previous employer filled it out on the spot and faxed a copy directly to my caseworker, easy peasy, no problem. 

The issue is my new job. I handed the forms for the new employer to my boss and he missed a few boxes as I hadn't been paid yet and didn't have a ""first paydate"" yet for him to fill in. I mailed it anyway, and received a call from my caseworker the next day that I missed as I was working. She apparently then just called my boss directly to get the info from him over the phone. I assumed that since she spoke to him directly she would have been able to verify everything with him right there. 

Yet I just received the same exact blank Employment Verification form for the new job again today. Do I have to ask my boss to fill it out all over again, or is there a possibility that my caseworker mailed it out before she called my boss. Its ""mail date"" is the same day we all played phone tag. My case has been ongoing since August 28th, my benefits haven't changed yet, but I am making significantly less money than before and I am running out of food and am starting to panic a bit. I doubt it, but I figured I'd ask if I can possibly convince them to ""expedite"" my case as I literally have nothing to buy food with. It's getting serious. I was denied SER for rental help so all my income is going towards paying off the rent I owed and it's getting to where I'm only eating every other day.

16h4ce8,New Jersey SNAP after switching from PA during pregnancy,"Hello!

I just moved from PA to NJ. I was on SNAP last year in PA and was due to receive SNAP (spoke to a PA case worker) after reapplying after my work termination and pregnancy. I didn't refill out an application because I moved and would have to close benefits. I just closed my PA medicaid. 

Anyway, I just applied today for NJ snap & familyfirst after being unemployed for a month and pregnant for a few months. After finishing my application it does not appear I will be immediately eligible for benefits. My biggest concern is *why*? I know they'll tell me during the denial letter. 

(1) I receive unemployment from NJ that puts me over the income limit for a single person household but I was under the assumption that being pregnant increased the % over the poverty level. Is this not true? (2) My unemployment benefits barely cover my expenses for the month including rent, electric, car, Student loan, etc. which nets me negative for the month and that does not include food. Because of this, I have been pulling out of my savings/checking which is around 10k combined. Do these resources count in NJ? (3) While I am not immediately ""disabled"" and prevented from working, I unfortunately was fired at no fault of my own (likely for being pregnant 🙄) and looking for comparable work but it has been difficult. I am in a lapse in medical coverage from PA medicaid to NJ medicaid program but will have my new doctor deem me ""disabled"" due to pregnancy woes, flare up of a physical disability I was diagnosed with years prior (no SSI/disability payments) and mental trama. I don't think me not meeting the 30 hours work requirement is really what is preventing me from receiving benefits here in NJ (since I was due to be elegible in PA after being fired) but is this what is affecting me? 

I'd be grateful for any insight from caseworkers who float around on the sub reddit. I guess overall I'm having a lot of anxiety I've never experienced before with being a new mom and not being able to truly focus on the baby and just ""being okay"" 🙁",whitefox094,1694555543.0,foodstamps

I just don't understand why she put me down for a work program and did not notify me(I don't want to be stereotypical but she was quite rude in the interview and the whole thing felt rushed). I can see right on my Action notice pdf that being Homeless is a cause for exemption. Did she just somehow override it or was it just missed? I have been trying to contact dcf through the phone number 1-866-762-2237 and the line just tells me ""All of our agents are busy, try again later"". I feel like its just going to keep telling me this all day and I'm so distraught. I just need to know if I can get this appealed at all? Life the past year has just been so rough and I can't lose this lifeline I so desperately need. Am I wasting my time trying to contact them?

16gdp9y,"i accidentally lied, now what?","**TL;DR:** accidentally lied about unearned income, i shouldn't qualify but i did, but now i need to prove the unearned income, but i still need food stamps. what do i do? is there any way to still qualify even though i messed this up? or cancel my application and somehow try again later? am i going to get in trouble?

background: i am disabled, including cognition related disabilites. i live alone and rely on unearned income from family that covers the basics of rent, food, caregiving. however i often don't eat enough because food prices keep rising and my family can only send so much. my rent is pretty high (it was lower when i moved in, but i can't move because it's hard to find ADA accessible housing) so money for rent + food + caregiving puts me over the income limit for EBT.

the issue: i accidentally lied about my ""unearned income"". i had been receiving an amount from family so i can survive and not die that was under the cutoff for EBT for a while, but i forgot they recently started sending me more because I'm disabled and needed help around the house and also my rent went up. And now it's over the cutoff, including when i applied, but when i applied, i said the old number by accident because the form was overwhelming.

So i already applied and got approved for state healthcare and food stamps, except the last step of verification for food stamps is i need my family to send an email saying they only send the amount that they used to send, which now isnt true and would be lying more.

i'm just not sure what to do because it's not like i suddenly dont need food stamps because my rent went up and i needed help with my disability and i don't have a caregiver covered by the state yet?

i'm trying really hard to gain financial independence through getting on SSI/SSDI, food stamps, state healthcare, and eventually getting some kind of part time gig once im more stable. hopefully someday rent assistance. This is a bit of a wrench in that plan

What do I do? 

the problem is like, I can't make the rent go down and I can't stop needing caregiving. So i need this amount of unearned income. But I need to get on government assistance because this unearned income is not reliable longterm, I can't rely on my family forever for a variety of reasons. But I can't get the government assistance unless i have less money.

I'm just really confused what to do now. I'm worried they'll get me in trouble for fraud or whatever. The truth is part of my disabilities is also cognitive issues. Memory and thinking and especially numbers and keeping track of things is not something I'm good at right now. 

I feel like they won't understand if I try to explain myself and I'm also not always super great at making myself understood, especially when I'm nervous. And i'm very nervous because obviously i dont want to like, go to jail or have food stamps suspended or something where they will no longer be an option for me, i need to keep that option open.",throwaway66557744,1694481731.0,foodstamps

Hello everyone, I have a bit of an odd question and my county office told me to go F**k myself and that they won’t answer any questions, so here I am.

A: I lose my food benefit and we starve or B: My food benefit increases because there’s now two people living in the house. I would be the only “income” involved here.

I’ve also been picking her up our child and shes been staying the night with me on my days off. My Ex and her new man just had another child together and decided to go for food stamps and she told me that something with child support is being looked at. I have all the records of money I’ve been sending her, we have nothing legal going between us, but with her doing this, will I have to be put on actual child support?


EDIT: 
I do wanna thank all of those who responded and informed me, with how often my ex has our child, and what she may be trying to push for I think the best option here is to end up fighting it and trying to get custody of my child, because there’s is no sensible reason for her to need child support nor foodstamps if she only has our daughter usually 1 and maybe 2 days out of the week. 
I’ve gotten mixed answers some saying it’s only if she asked for cash assistance, or TANF, and others saying it’s gonna happen regardless so either way I’ll just have to ride it out and see what goes.

Hi guys, I’ve previously made a post about needing help with my application and I’ve followed what you guys said, but that had lead me to another issue. 

From where I applied for SNAP benefits in 2020, it still has me as the Head of Household on the application and I’m no longer that. My roommate is the HOH. I have no idea how to completely start over the application. 

Another thing I’ve seen is that I can’t select who is and isn’t applying for the benefits under the “add a member of household” section. The option is greyed out and it won’t let me choose who is and isn’t applying. I don’t want my roommate applying, it’s just for me.",only_onesocksorry,1694086388.0,foodstamps

Anyone know what this is? What is the 0.00? Is that where the $281 should be, and something is wrong with my account? I am currently active until June 2024. The only thing I know to do is now monitor my balance every day and see if it increases by $281 at some point; so far, it hasn't.

16a6r1s,Questions about not getting benefits due to dpss error,"Every year I have to recertify for food stamps and GR at the department of social services here in Los Angeles California. Sometimes they do it on the phone and sometimes they have me come in in person. I went to the dpss a few weeks ago to recertify and fill out paperwork. The worker helping me said the GR recertification went through smooth but for some reason she was having trouble recertifying me for food stamps. She was calling other employees over to look at her computer. She said they had a new system that was a little confusing and thanked me for my patience as I waited for her to figure it out. Eventually she told me she thinks she figured out what the issue was and that everything would be fine. She told me I was all set and they wouldn't need anything from me until February 2024. A few weeks went by and then today when my benefits were supposed to show up on my card I see that only my GR (general relief/cash assistance) is on there but not the food stamps. This 100% has to be an issue on their end since I've been fully compliant (even going in person to sign papers and answer any questions they have). I live in supportive housing for chronically homeless people and people suffering from mental illness and I'm unemployed so there is absolutely nothing on my end causing my food stamps to be cut. If anyone is eligible I am. This is causing a huge inconvenience to me because I stretched out my food budget last month to the max and had just enough food to get through till today when I'm supposed to get my ebt food stamps. The problem is today is the 4th and it's a holiday (labor day). Nobody is available for me to speak to in order to correct this mistake. So i basically have to starve for a day or try to go figure something out which screws me over on other prior obligations i had made for the day  I'm going through all this hell and being denied something I'm entitled to because of someone else's stupidity. 
My main questions for anyone that might know are...
1. Has anyone been through something similar to this? Do you think they'll be able to fix my benefits right away eventhough this is obviously a problem with their system that's been going on for weeks?
2. Can I hold anyone responsible for putting me through this? The employee that interviewed me in person should have followed up until the recertification went fully through in her system and obviously she didn't. Nobody followed up with me. I didn't get any indication there would be a problem receiving my benefits today like I normally do. The employee I spoke with told me everything was fine and I was good with them till February.
*Additional info: I received a call from a lady at dpss a few days after I went in person. She begun to interview me and I said ""Oh is this a follow up interview to the one I did a few days ago?"" and she said ""Oh I didn't know you already spoke to someone else"" I informed her that I was just down there a few days ago to do an interview and recertification and she said that since I already spoke to someone else everything was fine and we didn't need to do another interview. She said she was calling to do the initial interview because she was unaware someone else already interviewed me but since they did everything was good and she didn't need anything from me after all. It seems very unorganized and like the people working there have no clue what there doing.
Bonous Question: Why is everyone so terrible at their jobs nowadays? The skid row housing trust organization responsible for my housing just went broke and lost 15 buildings they were in charge of. There is a park where people openly sell crack and it's literally a block and a half from the police station on 6th Street. The cops do nothing. I live in supportive housing and haven't had a working smoke detector in a year and a half despite complaining about it every other month. My mental health provider has no interest in addressing root causes of mental illness such as broken homes, bad parenting and rampant crime in people's faces, instead they just want to drug people and put everyone on psych meds. Why is everything so horrible and how do we fix it?",nihil_1r,1693867722.0,foodstamps
16a4nb4,CA Alameda CalFresh: will they call your landlord to verify rent before an interview? Don't want landlord to know I'm on benefits,"I just applied for CalFresh through [https://www.getcalfresh.org/](https://www.getcalfresh.org/en/faq) (CA, Alameda County). I provided photos of my lease agreement and screenshots of Venmo transactions to verify my rent amount.

Now, I'm worried that they will call my landlord to verify my rent amount for CalFresh, and that this will let my landlord know I'm applying for benefits. (I don't want to give my landlord any reason to question my income, since my lease renewal is coming up.)

Since I just applied, I don't have an interview date or anything like that. My landlord's name is visible in supporting documents, but not their phone number.

Does the Alameda office actually track down and contact your references just based on your application alone, before interviewing you or getting consent for doing so? Do they need your consent to contact references? Or am I worrying unnecessarily?

If they DO contact references, then how do I withdraw my application?

We desperately needed some groceries and prescriptions, so we decided this would be the last time we drive till I get paid to get tags and use what we had for the food and scripts. We purchased the scripts separately and the food and non food items together at self checkout. I never saw anything different on the screen as I swiped both the SNAP card and bank card. Saw a text when we got home that our bank was -$20. What?!? The snap had not gone through. It's not even showing up on my receipt. If you have more food items than snap money, does it deny the whole snap card? Why doesn't it pay the amount left on the card if that's the case? I know my pin was accepted, but after that didn't notice anything wrong till I got home. Now I have a -$30 overdraft fee as well... Grrrr.

I was expecting money to be deposited into my account this morning based on my skimming incident back in january, when it did not show up I called workforce services at 8am to see what was going on,   


I was initially told that there is a federal form that they mail you, you fill it out and then submit it back, over the course of speaking to the agent we found out that there was a ""Problem"" as the agent could not figure out how to request the form, after being put on hold while the agent tried to get answers - which he failed at (to no fault of his own) at which point I was told he would be calling me back after he found out more   


fast forward to 11am and he finally calls back, the unfortunate answer is DWS implementation of the plan suffered a Huge issue in that the form is not requestable at this time... the system simply doesn't have it, I was told that an error like this DWS usually fixes within a day but we'll see    


I was told that as soon as he had acess to request the form he would contact me back with more answers   


 \---- THIS IS MY OPINION AND IN NO WAY FACT, NOR WAS I TOLD ANYTHING THAT HAS LED ME TO THIS CONCLUSION ---

166386l,[CA] overissued EBT because grad student forgot to apply for FAFSA,"I got a notice today saying that the county overissued my EBT by an amount of $1800 because I should have been denied EBT due to my income being above the $1400 minimum. I was able to initially bypass the minimum because I am eligible for federal work study, and I have a letter from the school saying that I will be allowed to have an EBT at least for the academic year. 

The problem is: I forgot to apply to FAFSA this year since it’s all but useless for grad school (except for this food stamp thing). I’m pretty sure I’m still eligible, since my income hasn’t changed since the beginning when I first applied, but I don’t know if I’m able to gain eligibility this late to the game even if I did apply.

Recently got notified of the Time Limit Rules, saying that after Sept 30th, unless I contact my agent and inform them that I do not have transportation, or am physically unable to work, I will be lose benefits immediately and be ineligible for benefits again until 2025.

 I traded my car in a few months ago to help me get by, as it had become totaled anyway due to a rack and pin failure. Getting rid of it eliminated my insurance bill and seemed liie the best option, as repairs would have totaled over the cars value. I have heart disease and a thyroid condition, on top of other things that are out of my control that sprung up a few years ago that makes daily life perpetually harder than it used to be. All of these should make me exempt from having to adhere to the Time Limit Rules.

The paperwork says if I am not declared exempt from the Time Limit Rules by Sept 30th, I will be ineligible for food assistance again until 2025. 

Here's where it gets weird, my agent has not answered their phone for me in months, nor responded to my messages. Recently looked their supervisor up and tried to call them instead. Same deal. So I called the hotline to try to inform them of my claim to exemption, and the hotline workers had no idea what the Time Limit Rules were, and called me back a few hours later saying to ride out my benefits until november when I am up for re certification and just re-apply and see what they say.

I told them that I have until Sept 30th or I lose access until 2025. 
They acted like they did not know what I was talking about and said to just re-apply in November when my current allotment of benefits expires.

161aqzk,SNAP Screwed Up...,"Just a head's up because I just got a letter from HRA here in NYC saying my EBT-SNAP case was going to be closed as of Aug 30th and my benefits would be discontinued. Apparently I failed to fill out the 18 month form and do it online or send it back to them in time via mail. Thing is my benefits are cleared through 2025 according to the website and the app and I RECEIVED NO 18 MONTH FORM.

I've been checking the HRA site, reviewing what I might need to so regarding any forms for this or for medicaid recertification practically every week for several months just in case things changed now that the pandemic stuff is over. I've gotten nothing from them in terms of any kind of recertification paperwork and it always says I am good till 2025 SNAP wise. I go online and I can see a link for the form they want but I click it and it says I am not due yet for filling it out! So I can't oblige them if I wanted to.

I tried to call and of course got nobody. 2 hrs on hold and it's OF COURSE Friday afternoon. My case center is actually out in Brooklyn and quite a schlep for me as I am mobility disabled. I'm also direction blind when it comes to streets that are not numbered and I get lost easily in downtown Brooklyn as I do not know it well. I really don't know if I am allowed to just go there without an appt because it's not listed as a walk in center apparently?

I'm so glad right now that a charity runs my building and I have caseworkers I can go to, that they have special people they can call at HRA because otherwise I'd be losing my mind over this! The guy I need to talk to is gone for the day but they emailed him and he will look and figure it out they said on Monday and get right back to me.

I have to believe that this is an HRA F-up of some kind. My accounts say one thing. This form says completely another so either the info online and in the app is 100% wrong or they sent out this letter saying I was being cut off erroneously. Either way someone there screwed up royally and I could have lost my SNAP over it. Hopefully now I won't but now I don't trust HRA, the app or the website at all and HRA not answering the phone is just maddening when something like this happens.

I wish I could say this was the first time but no, this is the SECOND time since 2018 that I've almost had my case closed and possibly had to call for a hearing just to keep them because some clerk closed my case without warning for no discernable valid reason that I can tell.

So please triple check your case online and in the app. Keep on top of your regular mail because it looks to me that there are a lot of screw ups going on one way or the other at HRA re SNAP. I'm glad I did not go for just online notices because I might never have gotten this letter at all. If the website and app are not correct then what? There was no notice in my inbox that I needed to do this form and nothing in my snail mail either. No way to know this until I got this letter...

Just watch out because it could happen to you too!

I'm moving to MI this fall from TX, but we're adding another household member as my bonus child {18} will be moving in with us due to family issues. I am not in any way biologically or legally related to them - I just raised the divorced neighbor's kids because it was a neglect situation on both sides. 

How does that work for SNAP? Is the state of MI going to go after their biological parent for child support on someone of legal maturity age? Do they need to go on my case regardless because I'm in a parental role in the household?

I was going to have them open a case independently from us because we won't be preparing meals in common typically {we have multiple food allergies, they have different tastes} and because the idea is to teach them self-sufficiency and life skills with the goal of them moving out on their own in 6-12 months after getting a GED and employment. 

Is that the best way to do things? And while I know this is the SNAP forum, does anyone know about medicaid for the same kid?

Obviously it was late and I still submitted it anyways. Good thing to, cause when I uploaded it online I saw the notice that we have til next month to submit the form even if it's late. 

However, knowing that it's been submitted late, even a day later than it needed to be, I am curious how long it will take to process my SAR7 so I can continue getting my stamps? 

I believe I read something about how there may be a delay in benefits by like 10 days from the day I usually receive them if this is the case, being as a SAR 7 is submitted late.

I haven't seen any updates by mail or online notices. Not even my EBT app is showing me when I will get the next allotment of benefits.

I understand this is probably because I submitted late and therefore priority isn't being given to me (cases like mine because I missed the due date) so I'm curious when I can expect it to be processed or get an update?

Additionally, does this mean I will still get full benefit amount or half?

So in essence. 2 questions.

1. How long to expect my SAR7 to get approved since it was submitted 1 day after the allotted time slot (which is okay because the online notice informa me of submission extension until 9/30/23 ) 

2. Will I still get my full beneft amount?

I am in Los Angeles County, CA.

15w97ud,Work requirement for one parent while the other works.,"We have 4 kids, ages 6, 8, 10, and 16. I work full time, and my wife is the stay at home parent. We get food stamps for everyone, kids and both parents. Location: NY. 

Recently, we got a letter saying my wife has to look for work soon to continue food stamps. We are completely unable to both work. With 4 kids, you have to have 1 parent at home. The 16 year old goes in and out to her biological mothers. So, she is completely unreliable for babysitting. Each kid gets out at different times for school, and the youngest gets out first. Christmas vacations, summers, etc. We can't leave the kids home alone.

A babysitter would nullify the income of one parent working. Also, ever since our 16 year old fell found the stairs at a daycare, we said we would never again use a daycare or babysitter ever again. Plus, I had to fight DSS for daycare pay costs. The whole babysitter/daycare was a nightmare 16 years ago, and it left us with the intention that we would never ever do that again. 

Can my wife just opt out of food stamps to not go look for work while myself and the kids are on food stamps to bypass the requirement of looking for work? I'm not sure if the requirement is because my wife is on my case or because she is in the household at all and not working. It's my food stamp case with my wife and kids on mine. So could I just remove her from it?

PS. Anyone who thinks a stay at home parent isn't working is BS. Her day is filled with cleaning, laundry, cooking, homework, etc. It just doesn't make any money.

15so85e,Number for that handles sanctioned accounts directly in Texas?,"I need help in getting contact with the department that handles sanctioned accounts directly in Texas.

My account got sanctioned back In april after failing to report to the Health and human services commission I didnt have a job. When I originally applied I was unemployed however 2 weeks after I had gotten a job and was to report this to Workforce in which I did. What I failed to realize was I was also to report this to the ebt department after thinking the Workforce was gonna do it ( my mistake ) and didn't know about it until a month after in april ( I had just moved and was slow to report a change in address so I never got the letter telling me )

Regardless after finding out I was told to call up the Workforce and tell them of the situation since they were the ones who sanctioned my account.
However after it being sanctioned for over a month ( didnt find out until mid may ) the counselor that oversees sanctioned said she couldn't do anything but gave me a number to a department in Austin that can overturn it.
After calling the number which is 512-231-5701
Turns out it was a dead number.

I figured I might have heard her wrong when writing down the number. However it's like after that she's always unavailable now. After 2 weeks of non stop calling and going in person to talk I had frustratingly gave up as I was getting nowhere.

Faster forward to now, August is half way over, money is tight and with food prices how they are now I could really use my benefits again

In this job, I use my car which uses a lot of gas but it's extremely necessary to pay gas in order to do my job. This past month, however, I just recently calculated that I made about $1700 which I'd obviously way over the threshold, but this is the gross income from July.

Is it possible to deduct the gas costs from this since it's a dire necessity in order for me to do my job? After deducting the gas prices (almost $500 in gas a month) my income comes down to $1200.

15s5p4p,News: PA College Students may now be eligible for SNAP Benefits,"[ABC 27 Article](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-college-students-may-now-be-eligible-for-snap-benefits/)

This policy was actually released to the county assistance offices back in June, but DHS appears to have formally announced it to the public today to coincide with the start of the fall semester.

For more details beyond what the article provides, you can reference [OPS Memo 23-06-01](http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/oimpolicymanuals/snap/SNAP_Eligibility_for_Students_23-06-01.pdf).

Per the memo, already approved ""E&T-equivalent"" programs include:

* [TRIO Upward Bound](https://www.patrio.org/ub)
* [GEARUP](https://www.pagearup.org/)
* [ELECT](https://www.education.pa.gov/Policy-Funding/FederalPrograms/ELECT/Pages/default.aspx)
* [Title II Adult Basic Education](https://www.education.pa.gov/Postsecondary-Adult/Adult%20and%20Family%20Literacy%20Education/Pages/Legislation.aspx)
* [Chafee Education and Training Grant](https://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/other-educational-aid/chafee-program.shtml)

If you participated in any of these programs *prior to starting college*, PA DHS will treat you as meeting a SNAP student exemption.

If you *currently* participate in an [Act 101 program](https://www.pheaa.org/partner-access/schools/act-101.shtml) or receive a [Fostering Independence Tuition Waiver (aka FosterEd)](https://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/other-educational-aid/foster-education.shtml), PA DHS will also treat you as meeting a SNAP student exemption.

As the article describes, PA DHS also established a process for colleges to submit additional ""E&T-equivalent"" programs that meet certain guidelines to DHS for consideration.  If DHS agrees the submitted program meets the criteria, it'll be added to the list.

Per PA DHS's [new SNAP Student Website](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/Services/Assistance/Pages/SNAP-for-College-Students.aspx), in order to receive SNAP, a college student must:

1. Meet all normal SNAP eligibility requirements (e.g. - income limits);
2. Not have a meal plan (or have a meal plan that provides 10 or fewer meals per week); **and**
3. Meet a student exemption (such as, [but not limited to](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/Services/Assistance/Pages/SNAP-for-College-Students.aspx#exemptions), the ones described above).

Back in 2018, DHS also [expanded student eligibility](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/docs/Publications/OIM%20PCs%20and%20Ops%20Memos/OPS-18-03-04.docx) to community college students in career-focused majors.

15sb7b3,Nothing for over a month and a half,"I am in Texas and on Snap since maybe about March or April. Well, I just had a baby in June and I moved around that time as well. I had to submit some change forms and now I lapsed in my food stamps. Part of the problem is that they kept trying to use my husband's income even though we've been separate since February. So I had to have him removed. 

I called and had them escalate my case July 5th. It's now the middle of August and still nothing. WIC has been helping a lot, tuna and bread and milk, etc. I am so grateful for that. But I'm only bringing in about $1300 a month from my disability, $500 goes to my brother for rent, $500 goes to my husband, I barely have anything left for myself at the end of the month and SNAP helped so much and then for it to just be taken away for seemingly no reason?

I never got a letter saying I was denied, or to report anything within a certain timeframe, nada. NADA. And when I login to my ytb dashboard, it DOES say Denied. Any time I call, all they tell me is that I wasn't denied and that since it was already escalated there's nothing they or I can do and it's just a waiting game. What do I do? Should I try to reapply? Should I go up there in person?

A program called Mothers and Babies helped me, since I have a 5 year old and an 8 week old. They used their emergency funds to get me a $125 WalMart gift card and I was able to get some groceries about 2 weeks ago. That was so amazing of them tbh and I don't want to have to ask again because I'm sure there are people who need it more than I do, and I shouldn't have to rely on their emergency rations when I qualify for snap. 

I guess I'm ranting more than anything, and I'm not sure what answer I'll even get or if I provided adequate information.

TLDR; I have been on Texas Food Stamps/SNAP for a few months. Only income is from Disability. Recently separated from my husband. 5 yo and 8 week old. SNAP randomly stopped around June 6th and they can't tell me why my benefits are out when I call. Card is still active. The help line is not very helpful. They escalated my case which is supposed to put me toward the front of the line July 7th. Been about 2 months overall and they still just tell me to keep waiting and that they can't tell me why I haven't gotten anything for July and August. 

Should I just make a new application? Would that be better? Do I keep waiting? Why can't they tell me anything? None of this makes sense and I hate feeling like I can't provide for my kids and that I'm a terrible mother. 

Disclaimer: please don't worry too much, My 5 yo is in school and since my SNAP is still technically active, he qualified for free breakfast and lunch at school (major win, huge weight off my shoulders) and my 8 week old breast feeds, so it's mostly making dinners and making sure we get enough meat and protein. That's the hardest. Making sure we have ground beef or chicken for dinner, etc. That's the part that WIC has been helping with, tuna, beans, etc. We will be o.k. <3",no-way-1195,1692148421.0,foodstamps

And I told them I called because I didn’t know how to report it online. So anyways I updated my account but like how I’m self employed I make different amounts every month so I just said I make around at most 2600 monthly and chose 40% for business expenses basically and the Edd income. But my problem is how to report the increased income from last month. It doesn’t give me an option for that so I just put it as report “other”  and explained that on the month of July we had an increased of income because I was able to work more hrs and because of my partners edd income came in that month. But I wasn’t able to show proof or anything it’s literally them just taking my word for it😅. Is this the correct way to do it?

15reaaw,If I apply for SNAP do I risk jeopardizing my brother’s disability benifits?,"Sorry for the long post! It's just a really specific situation and the kind workers I talk to keep giving me conflicting information.

I live with my parents, 2 other people, and severely disabled brother. I don't know if my brother is considered a separate household, part of mine, or part of my parents. He is a tennant in their house (his SSI pays for his rent), and my parents claim him as a dependent as they cover 50% of his total expenses. I cover the other 50%, which includes his food. As his primary caretaker, I am the one responsible for making sure he is fed, clothed, clean, receives all his medication/therapy, and so on. The state pays for a portion of his day program. All other time I am with him. I manage (buy and cook) his food to ensure he is fed nutrious food that aligns with his dietary restrictions. This arrangement — me, his primary caretaker, meeting 100% of his needs and paying for 50% of his expenses, my parents, his legal guardian, renting him a place to live and paying for the other 50% of his expenses — is exactly how his caseworker and benefit attorney has guided us to do.

I'm considering applying for SNAP for myself but lost about who is considered part of my household and terrified to mess it up. Everyone in the house buy their own groceries outside of my brother; I provide, pay for, and prepare MOST of his food (there are two dinners a year I do not pay for). I sometimes cook for other members in my household in our shared kitchen using their groceries that they bought. Mostly for my parents who are elderly, but also for the convenience of others. We don't eat together or share food otherwise. Just share a roof and split bills (my share is ~$650). 

While the benefit office says he could be a separate household, his case manager and benefit attorney say he is part of my parents' household. Now I'm worried I'd somehow disqualify him for his current benefits (SSI) by me paying for his food specifically *or* by me applying for SNAP. For the record, I'm not looking to apply for SNAP for my brother ... it's just that to cover 50% of his expenses, I'm left with very little for myself. I'm kinda just now realizing I need to prioritize myself, and feeding myself seems like a good start. My parents don't want me to apply because it goes against their beliefs, but ... if it won't sabotage my brother's current benifits (I sure as heck can not afford to add half his rent and day program tuition to what I owe for him), I think this could be the leg up out of this tough situation.",paracheirodon_ssp,1692064137.0,foodstamps

Don't have a lease, not a real tenant, basically a guest in a house. I have paid rent though since 2021. Landlord is very unwell (dementia mid stage I think) and is moody/hostile. Accuses me of crazy stuff, can't remember anything etc. Daughter is not around to take care of her. I'm a good tenant actually.

I was meant to move out a few months ago, but the new place I was supposed to be approved for put me on hold for dumb technical paperwork reasons then they didn't get back to me and went dark and ghosted me.

I took full advantage and even borrow a loved ones car for my partner to take our child to therapy while I worked. And on august as of now 1812. My thing is my partner applied for edd on June and the pay got back tracked and he received the card by the end of july. But I wasn’t made aware that he received the card until a couple days ago. So my thing is how screwed am I? Mainly because I know our irt is 3007 but because how I’m “self employed” I barely made the cut in July but the Edd money messed that up a lot. What’s the worst I can expect or what should I do?",educationalad4782,1691955910.0,foodstamps

15q2q77,CalFresh Overissue?,"Hey y’all! I have a quick question to (hopefully) put my mind at ease. When I re-applied for CalFresh back in March, I included the income I receive from a contracting job, and didn’t include my income through my second job, which was work-study (my understanding was that work-study is not considered to be income).

Last week, I got a letter from CalFresh asking for either the pay stubs from the work-study job or verification that it is indeed work-study, or else they would discontinue my benefits. And now that I’m looking around, I’m realizing that this job may not have been work-study after all—it’s part of my academic program, but not officially federal or state work-study.

I feel stupid for the mistake, and am happy to pay back any difference in benefits. I’m just worried that they’ll accuse me of fraud or something. Or are they more likely to just take back the overissue? Does anyone have experience or perspective on a situation like this? (And of course, I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with my case worker for days—certainly doesn’t help the anxiety!)

15pt67u,Is this allowed? /Could I try again?,"I applied a while ago to California (orange county) calfresh during the pandemic. 
I live w my boyfriend who I’d been dating 2 years at that time. Once the lockdown was somewhat ended yet still high alert, I still had few opportunities for shifts at my job, so I couldn’t afford my portion of rent anymore, so he paid it all. Even with him paying rent, I could only sort of afford to pay my loans (I would have a forbearance for a couple months every so often on n off) and a few other things like gas, but only if u didn’t factor in food. 

I got the interview to determine eligibility, and told her my situation, and truthfully explained that I only share maybe one meal a week - if that!! - with my partner. To my knowledge it has to be something like half your meals shared or something for them to be part of the household income they determine?  She said that even the one meal meant he needed to be included and to send that info in to be eligible. 

Problem is, while he certainly was struggling a bit himself during that time, he made well above the limit for both 1 or 2 people because the limits are so low, never mind with me added on. Either way, to my knowledge she seems to have just, decided I was lying or something because those weren’t the rules I was aware of. And I didn’t find any info on challenging it or something..

Is there anything I could have done/ can do? 

Since that time, my bf is actually doing decently well financially, and I’m better but not “anywhere near the limit” better (long story short I don’t anticipate being close anytime soon, for disability reasons, but for a large number of reasons I’m pretty sure I would not qualify for any disability benefits..)

Anyway my income would qualify if there was a way for him to not be roped into it. It seems like it’s “on my file” on my online CA benefits account (I do get MediCal and it shows all benefit activity), that he is apparently “in my household” (even though that’s not the case for literally anything else like taxes or anything).

**I order groceries from Amazon Fresh regularly. I used my EBT in July without issue on Fresh. I have used my EBT to buy nonperishable foods as well on Prime with no issue.** 

**Last night I tried to order on Fresh and my EBT was declined. I've tried 5 times canceling and retrying since.** No, my cards are not frozen as nothing actually goes through and as a test I  ordered a few items from Prime today using my EBT and it went fine. Five hours and no issues and the debit is showing on my EBT card as well. Knock on wood.... sigh.

*I have zero EBT ineligible items, I have NO substitutions marked, I have a valid CC card on file for my tip and fees (although I keep reading that EBT buyers aren't supposed to be charged for delivery, I always am). My cart is 1/3 of my available EBT food balance as well. I tried taking my card off and putting it back on my account but that didn't help either.*

It's insane because Prime items come from warehouses all over the country and Fresh is local. If anything I would expect it to be the other way around with EBT ordering due to the out of state possibilities for Prime items. **I can't get a hold of a human at EBT so I can't get help on their end. I have sent an email but it will be a week or so before/if anyone replies. Since my orders aren't going through Amazon CS won't help me because there is not a specific item to connect my inquiry to either. I am so frustrated. I had zero issues until last night using Amazon Fresh for groceries.**

**Is anyone else having this specific issue?**  I am in California LA County for reference. 

**Does anyone else have any other ideas?** Like I stated, I have no substitutions marked, there are no non food items and I have two alternate cards available for the fees. Amazon shows me clearly that it is the EBT not my cards that are the issue. OR **does anyone know how to get a real live human on the EBT CS phone line?** I have Googled and found nothing useful that I haven't already tried. ",agreeable-ad9883,1691801030.0,foodstamps

I was a full time student and had been getting money from college from my parent’s TAP fund (this all went directly to tuition). I also took out a small federal loan and got a Pell grant, again going towards tuition.  I thought I should apply for Snap and Mediciad based on the fact that I was not married and he was not giving us access to any of his income. He however did help us out with rental and utility payments which, I never got the money. This money went directly to landlord. I know I should have reported that help, but I was under the impression that they were looking for verification that I live there. I didn’t know that money Snap funds were increased based on living costs, so they gave me the full amount every month.  I called someone on the phone for medicaid, and they said as long as you file taxes seperately for yourself and child and not married it’s ok to get medicaid for yourself at least.  The investigator told me this was fraud..  Im not sure how as the gov website says only to include married partners. Unfortunately he didn’t update his mailing address when I applied they generated the reports that are their primary evidence.

Did I get this because my kids had free lunches at school the past year?  I don't know if every kid took them, but I'm pretty sure every kid could have gotten free lunches for the last two years because something Newsom implemented.  So did every family get these cards?  

BTW, I didn't get 1.0/2.0/3.0 (I'm assuming there were three before, given the name), and started on Medi-Cal in early 2022.

I'm still on Medi-Cal, but I think I will probably get kicked off in November when I renew as I just started a job this month, and it'll be enough to push me over income limits (up until now, I've only had a job that didn't pay much because I didn't have steady hours).  

If I use this card, will I be subject to having to pay any of it back?

TL;DR  the question is very hung up on interview wise “ are you buying and preparing meals together”  I mean… yes and no..  he’s my boyfriend but also when I was very weak he kept an eye on me and helped me with a lot of things and took me to all of my appointments  ect. but he does not expect me to provide for him, I want to maintain my independence! If I were to move out tomorrow I want to be able to support myself. We are not locked in ( this sounds awful as this man is my PERSON, my other half) 


I feel I have sort of a complex case, but I’m not sure! This is all SO NEW to me and I’m trying to figure it all out on my own! I’m 27 and I was born with a congenital myopathy. I’ve been disabled my whole life but adapted and made things work up until about 2 years ago when my muscle weakness progressed and I had to stop working as a hairstylist and became wheelchair bound… I since have received SSDI after months of fighting for it because I didn’t have a formal diagnosis even though my brother has the same disease😅 ANYWAYS! 
 I live with my boyfriend/partner we are extremely serious as he has been here through this whole ordeal and never given up on me!! But want to maintain MY INDEPENDENCE!!!! I want to support MYSELF and help with things around the house, but SSDI only goes so far with the price of groceries the way they are and things I’m buying for myself to exercise at home for Physical Therapy. My question is I’m terrified about the interview! I’m afraid they are going to deny me because 1. I “ live” with my boyfriend  but I have no proof I have no utilities in my name, I just pay him half of the utilities, and I pay him rent since I didn’t have any income when I first regressed and was very sick he took care of me ENTIRELY. I owe him everything! So when they ask “ are you buying and preparing meals together”  I mean yes…. But ultimately I’m doing this for me. He doesn’t expect me or want me to provide for him! He wants to provide for me, but that’s not feasible in this economy right now. Sorry this is absolutely ALL over the place rambling.",onthe_lo,1691527109.0,foodstamps

But since the payment could possibly be seen as recurring, though each payment amount is different, will it be seen as income? As far as I know, it will show up as a single lump sum on my tax return, but it's hard to tell what it will look like on Calfresh's end. ",dethocalypse,1691193822.0,foodstamps

Has this happened to anyone else? I'm not sure what to do, I only have about a dollar on my ebt card now.

My gf had her wallet stolen and we cancelled the EBT card and ordered a replacement. Only problem is that it was almost 3-4 months ago and it should've already been here. We called and they said it was supposed to have been delivered, but wasn't so they're reshipping another one. The same thing happened, about a year ago, when we were in the same situation and we ended up waiting almost 5 months & having to reorder the card 3x, because the 1st 2 just never came. 
Is this something that happens a lot or has anybody else had a similar experience or are we just unlucky? Is there any other possible way to get a card & link it without waiting for the mail cuz obviously something isn't right. 

Yes, they have my address on file correctly, but my mailman is NOT very attentive and we receive our neighbors mail ALL THE TIME so that could be our issue as well. Just trying to figure out what our options could be or if anybody knew any tricks to get it faster or something, because, financially, it's been very difficult and just waiting around to, possibly, not ever receive the card like we've had to do before is frustrating.

Location California 
In January I became suddenly disabled. I immediately applied for snap benefits, SDI, and medical leave through work. 

I was approved for leave and SDI, but got a letter saying I was denied for SNAP benefits. This didn't surprise me at all as even on disability i made more than the allowed income. I did nothing and assumed I didn't qualify. 

About 2-3 weeks after the denial letter, I received an approval letter in the mail stating I was entitled to x amount of benefits each month and to look out for a card. I was confused, so I called my local benefits office and left a message in hopes to clarify. They never called me back. I called a couple more times again with no call back. I did receive a card in the mail with back benefits on it. 

Fast forward to July, and I have to recertify. I fill out my paper work and send it back. Over the this last week end I receive a letter stating that I did not include my paid leave information on my original application and they want that information. I'm no dumby. I'm certainly not trying to commit fraud, and I just can't imagine that's fact. As I said before I was initially denied because was getting what I thought was too much income any way. 

What action do I need to take? I feel like calling doesn't work. (It's quite hard to get in touch with some one as the automated system sends me around in circles) but I plan to call again in the morning.

15fzvjy,Texas: Credit Union loans and vehicle equity,"My family no longer has any income after Social Security disability mistook a severance payment from my former employer in 2020 as wages for work - I'm appealing. I'm looking into all of our financial options, one of which is bankruptcy. When I spoke with an attorney, I learned a new word: cross-collateralization. Essentially, my cars (financed at a credit union) are collateral that secures not only the car loans, but all of my loans with the credit union, including credit cards, which I'm in default and can no longer pay. So I have a car that's worth $20,000, but if I try to sell it, the credit union won't release the title unless they're paid $35,000 - the $15,000 still owed on the loan, plus my $20,000 credit card debt. Essentially, there's less than zero equity, and it's impossible for me to sell the car.

None of this is obvious, other than a clause in the fine print of my auto loan agreement that says in effect, *""The security interest created by this \[auto loan\] shall also secure all of my other indebtedness to you""*

Bottom line, a calculation of ""car value minus loan balance"" would show I have $6,000 equity in the car. But that equity doesn't exist. I'd need to pay $15,000 to get rid of the car (no way I can do that).

All of this will be settled in a couple of months, but I need to feed my disabled wife and kids now. I spent the last few days reading the *Texas Works Handbook*, but this is isn't a typical case as far as I can tell.

15e3pgj,Snap Benefits Payback Demand,"I was without work for three years while I worked on and waited for my SSDI process to take place, as I could not return to work because of a host of physical issues. I was easily able to qualify for snap benefits in Az because, in spite of my wife working, our outgo was actually larger than our income. I was finally awarded my SSDI early retirement last October which included a year of eligible back pay ( which disappeared almost immediately due to unpaid bills). My snap benefits were canceled upon my receiving my disability income, which was to be expected. Yesterday I received a notice that all my snap moneys I received would have to be paid back. There was no explanation, just a listing of what I was paid over the year and a half that I received the benefits. Can they retroactively request the return of the money because of the SSDI backpay I received? What if I had won a lottery a year later? Would I have to return the money even though I was truly eligible at the time? Seems really fishy to me. Any insight would be appreciated. I will also be calling them for an explanation.

Our worry comes from the fact that around 18 months ago he was in a bad spot with some bills and made the bad decision to sell his benefits twice. This was obviously wrong and he hasn’t done it again since. Is it possible that they found out about this after all this time and closed his case?

We are a family of 3 who currently has SNAP benefits.

Our rent (including utilities) amounts to about +/-$3,000/month.

15bd0u4,Reporting Concerns - NY SNAP,"College student here. Two concerns.

First concern. I was enrolled for a little less than a year in NY SNAP. The last month-ish of my SNAP benefits, I took on a temporary job, only cashing two checks during that time. In total, the checks were less than $1,000. I had no additional income as a full time student. The checks were written a few weeks before they were actually cashed, because of the time it took to receive them via mail. During that same time frame, I had also already received a letter in the mail about recertification of benefits. I chose not to submit recertification. Did the two checks need to be reported, even if I was still totaling below the poverty line? And if I had already received the recertification notice? If so, what timeline should they have been reported on (considering written and cashed dates)?

&#x200B;

Second concern. When I applied and was accepted, I used my off-campus apartment address. I have lived and still live at that address. However, although the small job I did was virtual, the W-9 I sent in used my out of state hometown address. I'm not sure why I used hometown, force of habit. Will this be an issue later on as this tax form is showing a different address than the address I used for SNAP and it was signed during that last month I was receiving benefits? The address I used for SNAP is my primary residence. Can I alter the W-9 a month out from submitting it? Unsure if I should be worried about this or need to change anything.

I'm aware this is a blurb of complex worries. I want to be sure I am avoiding unnecessary trouble and doing the right thing.

I'm housebound so getting to a farmer's market to take advantage of dollar for dollar SNAP matching isn't an option for me, and produce from the store is too expensive for me since ordering online means paying more as it is.

Top Box does deliveries only every 2 weeks, but the delivery is free and for produce boxes, using SNAP will get you 50% off, up to $15 off in total. Their large mixed produce boxes come out to $9 once you get your SNAP discount, or a small personal produce box comes out to $5. Being they only deliver every other week, this means not being able to eat produce daily of course, but right now my aim is to do better than none.

Anyway, I wasn't sure how well known they are and thought I'd share it here!

 I been living in a homeless shelter with my fiance and my 2 kids since May 6, but we finally got approved to stay here about 1 month ago. I want to mention that im not in the worst position financially, i work a 9-5 monday-friday and have a decent savings. We never struggled with food or any essentials like diapers/clothes etc. The reason why i became homeless was because i could not find an apartment in time and the person whos house we were living at decided they wanted us to go. No bad blood there i completely get it, having 4 extra people intruding your home daily doesnt sound fun.we were told to leave, and ended up going to path in the bronx. I been applying for apartments on my own daily, and i either get no responce, or get 2 specific messages. 1. That unfortunately they are looking to rent to someone who makes 40x the monthly rent anually, and 2. That its too many people wanting to move to the apartment (4 of us to a 1 bedroom cause thats all i can afford). 

Our case worker told us that we need to pursue a housing voucher, made it seem like it was mandatory to pursue. I still do not know for sure if i have to mandatory pursue it while being in a homeless shelter, but to avoid any issues with evicting us we went ahead and followed instructions. She told us we must apply for cash assistance in order to have an open case. The goal was that wether we get denied or approved (denial was the likely scenario since i do have a savings), that it would lead to us having an open cash assitance case which is needed in order to pursue a housing voucher from ""NYCHA"" or in this case ""CITYFEPS"". The thing is now they want my fiancee whom im living with in this homeless shelter to file for child support. I provide for both my sons and my fiancee as far as my financing allows. We all have everything we need, we never go hungry, we all have propper clothing. She nor me have anything to complain about aside from our housing situation. 
I have been saving to build a security nest for when i do have an apartment im able to afford minimum 6 months of rent or more in case i lose my job or something happens were i cant work. Just for security reasons.
My fiancee is the head of household at the homeless shelter, when we first showed up to path i asked to be the head of household i was told i couldnt be. Now cash assistance is sending her applications and giving her child support appointments even after providing residency proof that we are all together at this homeless shelter.

What are my options here?Can i be put on child support even if i live with my fiancee and both our kids? is there anyway i can avoid being put on child support? My fiancee doesnt want to because it makes no sence to, we are together and we are happy and im providing for all their needs. Cash assistance was only done because our case worker told us we have to for a housing voucher. They mailed us applications for both the kids and given her an appointment they want her to go to for child support labeled ""Mandatory"". I dont know how we should proceed with this.

His father helped with the baby's daycare cost this summer before she goes to free universal 3k in September.
We also have separate businesses that are not generating much income either. But we both work regular jobs too. 

 questions: 

Should I still add him as a household member if he's not eating our food (he's pretty much a roommate at this point)? 

Do I report income from self employment if we don't really receive income from it (any revenue is put back into the business for now). I had to pay myself (for covering rent) once earlier in the year due to an emergency, but nothing since. 

What other options do we have to prove income from the business if he doesn't have tax information? And is there a way to report revenue in the negative (It won't let me list zero) or do I just not report it?

1 year later, the county sent me an overissuance for the ENTIRE YEAR, including the 42 weeks of the year in which I was not working nor receiving any income. 

I was told by a legal aid attorney that this is incorrect, and that my overissuance should have only accounted for the 10 weeks in which I was receiving income. The attorney told me that they would get back to me with citations affirming this, but they have since ghosted me. 

Does anyone know the specific regulations that would apply to my situation? I want to have something I can cite to which clearly states that I should have only received an overissuance for the 10 weeks in which I was receiving income. 

Thanks in advance.",willward24,1689955273.0,foodstamps

i sent them my updated paystubs a few weeks ago as well as explicitly stating they got it wrong. i have received acknowledgement of the documents through the benefits portal, but still not change in my benefit amount. i requested a phone appointment a week ago but have not been contacted. what else can i do to escalate this? i can’t afford only having $66 for food until december.

My circumstances:
- Will be full time grad student starting end of August
- EFC 0, pell grant eligible 
- Eligible for work study
- Current working full time in Texas right now but will quit and not be working when I move to NYC for grad school
- Previously on food stamps in 2020/2021 in another state as an undergrad student 

How soon can I apply? 

My lease starts August 1 but i’ll probably quit my job August 4th. I plan on moving to NYC end of the month and would like to have food stamps already by then.

ORIGNAL POST:
So very confused here..

QUESTIONS: 
1. Does anyone know if there another interview or additional steps that's needed to receive the ""ongoing"" benefits after one-time ""expedited"" SNAP benefit was received (even though the letter saying it's been approved is in my hands)?? 
2. Are there normly two separate case numbers for ""expedited"" and ""ongoing"", or are they lumped into one Case#? Or do I have to apply *again* for a new case for ""ongoing"" benefits? 
3. Is it normal to wait 2 hours+ on a call to talk to someone at NYC Nutrition Assistance Program?

BACKGROUND:
SNAP application was expedited and recieved the benefit on 6/3/23. Also *got mail about monthly SNAP being approved and that it will be provided on 4th of every month.*
But didn't receive anything on 7/4 so checked AccessHRA, and saw that it asked to submit a document that was already submitted... so resubmitted same document on 7/5. 

Called Human Resources Administration today (7/17) to hear of the current status for the ongoing benefits, and the automated message said expedited benefits were given as one-time payment and the ""decision hasn't been made for application for the ongoing SNAP benefit"". Then gave direction to directed to call another number for details (NYC nutrition assistance program). NYC NAP(?)'s automated message said the Case was only for ""one-time benefit"", so been on hold to talk to a human for past 2 hrs (keeps saying ""your hold time is more than 45 mins"").  

Phone numbers that's been tried:
Human Resource Administration 718-762-7669
NYC nutrition assistance program 718-557-1399
FYI - Checked Access HRA too, only says one time SNAP on the case and doesn't say anything about ongoing benefit

At first, I didn't know who that was as I haven't heard of this place before and despite the caseworker receiving a report about it, neither did she know who or what they were. I also told her that I have been receiving Disability benefits for about several years now and gave her my SSN, but apparently when looking in her computer there was no information available on that? Even though I've had food stamps for nearly 2 years and verified before that I was on Disability. I was also pretty confused because one of the first questions she had asked me was whether or not I still worked at a clinic.

Whenever I received the 'Request for Verification' through the mail, one of the requirements it asked for was to verify income for a place named, ""CR Cafes"". So I tried googling it, CR Cafes.LLC had come up and I realized a cafe place I tried working there for a week and quit on January may have been it. And I ended up quitting due to my social anxiety becoming very bad, I'd constantly feel light-headed and I ended up vomiting, so I considered working at the cafe as my first job to be too stressful and ended up quitting. I haven't worked again, either. But.. the lady mentioned that she received a report around May of this year. I wanted to know why exactly that, despite me being at this place for a week on January, she finally receives a report about it now? And why would she ask me if I worked at a clinic if that was my only job? 

What could it mean and what do I need to do prove that I do not work at this place? It's been months and the only verification it's asking for is from June to July regarding income. 

Right after the interview, I faxed the Disability Benefits statement, my ID, and a written statement stating that I don't work there before I received this letter. Do I just wait to call them by phone and ask about the papers I faxed and hopefully it clears up? Or do I need to still submit the income verification?",no-entertainer4607,1689459073.0,foodstamps

14zrpry,Texas Snap renewal denied,My renewal was denied June 2 due to “requested documents not turned in”. I called because I did send in all the documents. After multiple phone calls/long waits I found out it was because my child support document said my last payment was Sept 2022(I haven’t received any payments since) and the forms they sent me were electronically signed. I sent in a letter explaining I hadn’t received child support since Sept 2022 and hand signed/sent in the forms by June 13. I called multiple times asking if I needed to send anything else. Everyone told me I just needed to wait the 30 days to process the documents. This Monday I was told to call today if I haven’t heard anything(it’s past the 30 days). The person I spoke to told me my case was denied and closed on June 13th due to the forms being electronically signed and that I needed to send in a new application because they most likely won’t reopen the case. I sent in a new application but am so frustrated and upset because I haven’t received benefits since May. I’m a single mother and my daughter has been on summer vacation. It’s been really difficult to buy groceries and keep her fed. Does anyone know how long it could take for the new application to process?

Then close to the end of the month, I got an automated phone call 'reminding' me to turn in paperwork. Paperwork that the worker I talked to didnt inform me about. I call back. Im told I have to return some sort of proof that what I said was right and it was due the 30th. Fine. I figured out what was needed, and had someone write it out for me and mail it off.

Keep in mind the only thing I've recieved so far was the need to recertify.  A week ago I get the form that was supposed to be sent out to me. Dated the 28th. But I already sent in the information the worker asked for, so I ignored it.

Yesterday I got a letter saying they didn't receive my information. I call today the first worker who I talked to said they saw a document on  file (wouldn't even say what the document was) but she was sending me to a case worker. Fine I expected that. I'm on hold for 2+ hours and when they picked up they immediately disconnected the call.

I dont know what to do? I'm not in a position to go to an office (I'm disabled(blind) and rely on family/friends to take me places). And I know I should have called to make sure they recieved my info, but I have a lot going on at the moment and it slipped my mind.

Is my only option to call every morning until I finally talk to someone and get it figured out? I cant afford even one month with stamps. 

I understand they're over worked and understaffed, but I've never had this much difficulty in my 8 yrs of receiving benefits.

14xxs7e,Medi-cal income is wrong after applying for foodstamps. Scared of getting in trouble.,"Hi. ( California ) Long story short, I applied for foodstamps in 2022 and got approved. However for some reason, they changed my income to 0.01. I called to correct it and they said because of PHE they changed it to this so I wouldn't lose my medi-cal and that I will have to reapply with my new income next year ( 2023 ) however they also said they will adjust it for me. 

To add I did not reapply for foodstamps as my situation improved.

Well 2023 comes around and I got a letter saying that I got reapproved for medi-cal at just $0.01 again being my income. I was expecting a renewal form, I freaked out, and I called to try to fix it. ( my income now does not qualify me for medi-cal ) They said I need to send in my income for the last 30 days. I emailed them July 1 and still haven't heard from them and my income ( looking at coveredCa) hasn't changed. I started the report a change application but I stopped because I figured I should try to wait a bit to see if they will make the changes.. The worker I talked to said I should recieve a letter within a week but I haven't recieved one. 

Also will I be In trouble? I'm self employeed and I forgot to report my income when it increase within the last year or so. :(( to be honest I just forgot.  My income fluctuates month to month so it makes it hard to really determined if it changes or if it's more or less the same. 

When I try to explain the situation, The worker I talked to said that the last 3 years doesn't matter and it's irrelevant before the of PHE as they just want to know what I make now. 

Now I'm just trying to figure out what to do. 
I don't want to get in trouble for the time I forgot to report a change, or for that fact that it says I only made 0.01 even though I wasn't the one who put that.

I called twice and both times the representative told me to just wait. I have been homeless and jobless for over a decade, have not had a single government aid in these ten years nor prior either. I do not understand what is taking so long, especially when my case is so clear cut. Has my time spent living under the radar made it difficult to process my case? Being told to wait longer is increasingly frustrating when you're hungry. In ten years of homelessness and joblessness, this is the first time I have applied for something like this, so you can imagine how hungry I am currently. Hopefully I'll actually be alive by the time they review my case.",thegetawaydrive,1689038902.0,foodstamps

14w982x,CA Los Angeles Appeal or Reapply?,"CAL FRESH - Los Angeles County, CA 

An adult disabled son lives with parents and pays rent from SSI. His mom updated his information for review on [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) A notice that Cal Fresh was discontinued came in the mail. Mom called and was told it was because no telephone interview was made. Mom was confused because on [benefitscal.com](https://benefitscal.com) it showed nothing was due. She did not understand she needed to call in addition to completing the tasks online. The Rep on the phone said there was nothing she could do since she missed the deadline to make the call. Mom asked if she could appeal. The Rep said she would transfer her to an intake Rep. (at this point Mom had been waiting on the phone 1.5 hours to speak with someone) The Rep assured her the wait for intake Rep wasn't as long. 

After 10 minutes an intake Rep listened to the situation and said Mom should help son reapply instead of follow up with an appeal but in his opinion the son shouldn't receive any benefits because he isn't elderly and disabled and told the Mom to reapply immediately but that he was confident her son wouldn't qualify because he wasn't elderly. Mom explained that the son prepared his food with his personal aide that is provided through the Regional Center and the Rep told her this didn't matter because he was young. This Rep was rude and disrespectful to the Mom so the Mom just thanked him and ended the call. Now she is discouraged and doesn't know what to do. 

Should she appeal or reapply?
