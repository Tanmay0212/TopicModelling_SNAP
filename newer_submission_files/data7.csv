t9lkfr,"Just got approved for food stamps for the first time ever, and I’m shaking.","$450 a month. That’s how much we got approved for, and that’s how much we would spend before on groceries IF WE SPLURGED. No more 3 course meals of cheerios, no more “it’s only a week past date and it doesn’t smell bad yet.” No more hitting up relatives to see if they had any old frozen food they didn’t want anymore. I’m so happy, I could cry right now. This is gonna give us the breathing space we need till I start my new job, I’ll be able to keep our car from being repossessed by selling my plasma. And with any luck, we should be able to afford rent when my check comes in. First check won’t be till past the first, but we are lucky enough to have a waiver for a late payment to use. It felt like everything was hopeless this morning; like we were at the bottom of a pit, and a rope, thin as it is, was just dropped down for us to hang on to.

However, this job just gets me some days. So, I'm sitting here at my desk with teary eyes looking at a note that was submitted with a household's recertification that says, ""Help, please.

---
**Edit 6/23** - Per FNS, the authoritative record for what waivers states are asking for is located [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/snap-waivers-flexibilities).

*link corrected - sorry,  FNS moved it when I wasn't looking*

---

Question:  *I live in ____ state, I just went though redetermination/renewal, and now they're saying my amount is ____ which is way less than the _____ that I was getting before.  Why?*

Answer:  This is almost certainly due to the reversion to normal, or as close to it as things are likely to get at this point.  Your new benefit amount is very likely the **actual calculated benefit amount** based on your income, resources, household size, and countable expenses.

*Why is this happening?*

In 2020, the federal government, as a part of the COVID19 response, massively expanded SNAP benefits, for any state that had declared a state of emergency related to the pandemic, which was pretty much every state.  That initial burst of funding ended in March, and then was extended for several more months.  it is important to remember that this is a ***departure from program policy*** as an emergency measure **only**, and should not be construed as a change in business.

*What's changing, and what's staying the same?  I heard it's going to be this way until September...?*

The additional 15% benefit amount is staying the same through the end of September.  Other state waivers that allow up-to-max-benefits are likely ending at the end of June.  At this time (mid-June) we have no information about what states may continue to receive that waiver for July, because it is approved on a month-by-month basis.  I would speculate that it will actually end June 30, because that's when the lion's share of the additional funding goes away, and most states don't have the reserves to continue to pump money into the program.

*Will I receive any kind of notice about this?*

No, you probably won't.  The reason is that the feds classify a change like this as a ""mass change"", which is specifically excluded from having a reduction notice.  Updates will probably be news releases and social media, but they won't send you anything specifically telling you.  If you've been surprised by this, this is probably the reason - if it helps, understand that a widespread notice by mail costs tens of thousands of dollars, which is probably the main reason there isn't a notice that goes out.  Yes, it sucks, and we know it.

Updates as they appear will appear here in a top-level stickied comment from the mod team.",slice_of_pi,1623809138.0,foodstamps

q7p5wb,Thank you to SNAP workers.,"I am not posting this as a question or a complaint... I am posting this as a genuine a heartfelt thank you for the people who work for SNAP/Medicaid LIHEAP and any other Human Services department.

The last few years of my life have been the most difficult of my life and you were there for me when no one else was. You made sure my heat wouldn't get turned off. You kept food in my belly. You paid for my internet so I could still see my mother on her deathbed in the middle of the pandemic from hundreds of miles away.

The work you do, affects so many in personal ways. Its my prayer that you understand just how important what you do is. And yes I know you can deal with rude, and some ungrateful people. But you do the right thing because its the right thing and not depending on how this person acts.

As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety I know I can be a real asshole to deal with at times and I am blessed people in your field understand not to hold that to me when I lose myself in the moment and may be awkward scared or upset. I worked in healthcare directly with the public for 16 years before I got sick, having to deal with people like me, and I have an amazing amount of respect for people that are able to.

I guess what I am saying is thank you, and thank the lord almighty I live in a country that helps me and my family. As divided and diverse as I am sure the people on this group are as poverty knowns no race or religion. No demographic is immune from it. We can all agree, that we are blessed and or lucky depending your belief system, that we have this safety net. Please treat your caseworkers with respect and consideration for the magnitude of responsibility they have to make sure people are taken care of.

Woah, that was a little more then I originally intended on writing.. Uh yeah so thank you.

q8w4b5,THANK YOU FOR A 2ND CHANCE AT LIFE,"I got EBT for the first time today in Cali. It's going to save me and my best friends lives. We've been living off 4-5$ a day for 2 years. Mostly a diet of whole wheat bread, eggs, brown rice, lentils, oats and whole grain pasta. When there was room in the budget we'd get onions, garlic, bananas, apples, frozen vegetables, milk, yogurt, or cheese. When we had rare opportunities to spend a bit more we would buy 1-2 lbs of meat and try to spread it out over 7 meals. Sometimes they'd have special deals on different things or give out free stuff which we would always be on top of.

We have to walk several hours to get anything we need and that's only after couponing for hours to find things we can barely afford. All during this pandemic. It's a dreadful feeling to just survive and walk to feed yourself every day knowing you're not even hitting all the food groups. All of my socks are destroyed full of holes and my feet are blistered. There was no money for anything extra except cleaning supplies, no health insurance so if something went wrong we were screwed. The way this has affected my best friend was the worst part, running out of money and looking for change to pay for couponed bread and seeing the look on their face knowing it was just gonna be more of this. Getting fruits/vegetables felt like a luxury. All these grains had us feeling sluggish and depressed.

Now what little we had in our lives was coming to an end too, and homeless was looming, so I looked for help and found out about the EBT process. I applied and got it almost instantly. I just got home after finishing it and knowing it was expedited and it's safe and sound and real. It doesn't feel real. The lady who helped me on the phone was amazingly helpful and kind and continued to help me throughout the process until the end. The ladies at the office I went to today were also just as helpful and kind. I felt like I was dealing with caring people who had compassion and understanding. I don't really have family near me to depend on and I didn't trust I would qualify for any help from government, but after seeing how quickly my life just got beyond saved... I feel stupid for not getting help sooner. The amount of EBT covering our food is probably 4x the amount we were spending on things for our selves in a month, and that's counting cleaning supplies.

With EBT covering our food (and being able to buy a variety of vegetables/fruits/meat/etc) we can now afford to buy bikes and find work and save our lives and get out of this mess. The 3 hour walk of doom can now be a half hour commute. On the most positive side, I went from 450 to 190 lbs. So, I feel blessed for a 2nd chance.",ireallylovechicken,1634327706.0,foodstamps

I’d love to be able to load benefits on to your card today so you can go to the grocery store or pay your rent. But sometimes I can’t. We have to adhere to the federal rules and regulations. If you have not turned in all the necessary documents, I cannot do anything to “turn on your case” without being called in by Program Integrity. So please don’t yell at me because “I’m not helping you.” 

“So if I turn it in today, will I get it today?” Ordinarily I would tell you yes, but we have been INUNDATED with new cases. I cannot promise you I’ll get back to your case today. I explain to people, “I process paperwork in the order in which it is received. So if 10 people turn in paperwork before you, then yours is the 11th case I work on.” Do NOT respond to me by yelling about how long you’ve waited for an appointment. That is beyond my control. Ordinarily in my office we have 18 intake workers. Today we had 6. It’s not my fault we can no longer do 72 appts a day. Today we are doing 24, because you cannot force 6 people to do 18 people’s worth of work. (The Union had to step in because us 6 were doing 18 people’s worth of work.)

pbzp6q,A moratorium on questions that are beyond our scope to answer.,"Over the last couple of weeks, the sub has gotten flooded with questions only tangentially related to the SNAP program. Public assistance is difficult sometimes to navigate: we get it...**but**...a large number of these questions are about subjects that aren't something anyone here can answer.  Examples:

*I am still waiting on ___. DAE have this problem?*

This is very low-effort. We can tell you,  if we know, what the policy is about why information is needed, or help you figure out what to do about a delay is service delivery. We might even be able to help you connect with the agency you're working with if you're getting frustrated...but those answers are going to have to come from the agency.  They're the ones holding the reins. 

*My EBT card doesn't work at this retailer in this specific location. Anybody know why?*

The answer to this is almost certainly one of two things : either your account doesn't have the balance you think it does and it's getting rejected for insufficient funds, or there is a problem with either the retailer's EBT processing or with the EBT system in that area in general. Neither possibility is something that we're in a position to help with.

*I haven't gotten the PEBT card/funds, and my friend got theirs*

PEBT is functionally identical to SNAP at the user end, but it's a completely separate program with different requirements, criteria, and funding stream that is administered at a local level by agencies whose waivers on implementation vary by school district. Saying we have no idea is a gross understatement. 

We may be able to tell you when funds are coming or if they're coming...but this is the main thing we're seeing over the last couple of weeks that I alluded to above as an adjacent program. PEBT is a parallel track to SNAP that uses a lot of the same infrastructure underneath.

We're going to be modifying the sub rules and Automod responses to give better answers, as well as point people towards resources, and the FAQ will get updated as soon as we're able.

I promise you I am not being sarcastic, but I just don’t understand why people who are in need (especially seniors) will decline or withdraw from benefits because it’s “not enough”?

The current minimum SNAP benefit is $23. This is what most seniors receive. I hate that and I agree that is not enough. Obviously that’s not enough. But if you are hungry why would you turn down $23? The food pantry is not enough. If you are having trouble affording food, why turn down help?

Personally, I don’t qualify for anything anymore. But I think of it like, if a grocery store were to give me a $23 gift card every month I would love that. Even now, when I can afford to pay on my own. I would absolutely love a $23 bonus. 

Obviously it’s not enough to feed myself or my family but it’s enough to buy some vegetables or maybe some eggs, bread, and milk. I see it as that’s $23 of my own money that I don’t have to spend on groceries. So that’s $23 more every month that could go towards bills, prescriptions, or whatever. 

I especially hate seeing seniors pass on that $23 because it’s not enough (which I agree) but then struggle to afford their meds, skip meals , pay late fees on their bills because they were $10 short, have $35 withdrawn from bank account due to overdrafts fees etc. I know $23 is not enough, and I know compared to your needs it seems insulting but $23 is still something and it can help even if it is just a small amount. 

Please help explain why so many people, especially seniors, turn down this benefit. I genuinely do not understand.",true_owl370,1674852883.0,foodstamps

fyfuef,"Social Security Income ONLY, but Own My Own Home","I thought it might be useful to post my own circumstances by way of encouraging other in similar circumstances to apply for SNAP benefits.

I am seventy years of age,  retired with Social Security income only.  I live alone in my paid off home in Seattle, Wa.  

That happens to provide me with a $16/month benefit.  Is that worth applying for?

Yes.  For April and May my benefit goes up to about $170  because the SNAP benefit is temporarily increasing to the maximum regardless of income because of the virus.

The City of Seattle owns it's own electric utility service,  and discounts the cost of electric service for me by about 50% because I qualify for SNAP benefits.  That's true for the city's water,  sewer and garbage utility service as well.

The city also has an extra charge for auto license tabs that I get discounted by $20/year because of SNAP benefits.

COMCAST provides me with internet service for $10/month because of special rates for SNAP participants negotiated by the City of Seattle 

A year ago in January I signed up for training as a CNC machinist with a local college because of the critical shortage of machinists driven by the Boeing company and the booming economy.  The $1700 cost per quarter for three quarters was paid by the State of Washington because I qualified for SNAP benefits.

I completed that training,  but unfortunately the shutdown of 737 MAX production and now the virus has meant I haven't found the job I had anticipated  ----which would have got me off of SNAP benefits.

There may be other discounts I'm not aware of because I have SNAP benefits.

Even a small SNAP benefit may pay off with surprisingly large results.",,1586525312.0,foodstamps

Our goal is to finish your application the first time we see it, but its difficult when there are so many blanks in the application and there are no verifications provided with the applications/renewals. We are spending too many days trying to plug in missing information that should already be with the application, and this was never an issue before. Those are weeks we could have used to process thousands of new applications.

*Always* provide verification of your ID, address, income, rent/mortgage, child care, and past due bills with your application. Employers and landlords rarely disclose information to us.

Provide 2 representative check stubs from the last 45 days that include your name, your employer's name, gross income, hours, and pay date. *Please no screenshots of your direct deposit or your payroll app that doesn't show names.*

If you are self employed, keep your earnings tracked on a calendar. You can submit the previous 2 complete months or the last 4 pay dates if you are paid weekly, biweekly, or semi-monthly if you have a fixed schedule. If your boss pays you in cash or personal check with no deductions, have them write it. And always date and sign this.

You get help for rent, utilities, child support, toiletries, etc.? Get verification of how they help you, 1 amount of how much they give you or pay for you, and how often they help you. Have them sign, date, and put a phone number. If you are past due, provide your bills.

Understandably, we're getting a lot of questions about this topic at the moment - this thread is intended to stem the tide a bit, so please keep commentary and questions on this topic here for the time being.

**What we know**:  ~~As of 4/6~~ Per the federal [Food & Nutrition Services page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/covid-19-emergency-allotments-guidance), ~~16~~ many states have been approved for the Emergency Allotment waiver.  I will hazard a guess that there are more in the pipeline, but because these waivers are granted at the state's request on a monthly basis, this is obviously subject to change on a state-by-state basis.

[Guidance from FNS as of 4/1/21](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-covid-emergency-allotments-phase-3-guidance.pdf) indicates that FNS is expanding benefits for those states still in an emergency status to increase allotments up to $95/mo, for those households that have received less than a $95/mo increase from the Emergency Allotment waiver thus far.

Because these changes will require additional updating of the data systems used to support SNAP issuance, it is possible, even likely, that some delays in the timing of these benefit implementation dates will occur.  Again, because this is managed at the local agency level, what state or county you live in will be highly relevant in answering those questions - please understand that agencies are getting this information at nearly the same time that the public is being informed...so they may or may not have answers in the moment.

> Can State agencies use EA to offset a SNAP overpayment claim? 
> Response: No. Over-issuances of SNAP benefits cannot be collected from EA.

That means if your state is taking part or all of your increased emergency benefits (this is apart from your 'normal' benefit allotment), they are in violation of federal guidance. Let us know if this is happening to you. 

E.G. normally you would be approved for $100 in SNAP, but with the emergency increase you're receiving the maximum $234 per month. You had a previous overpayment claim against you, and the state is taking over $100 per month from you (even as much as the full $234).

fhwhdc,How Far Will $15 in Snap Benefits GO?,"A couple of years ago I applied for SNAP benefits.  I am 70 years of age now and have zero earned income ----SS only.

I own my home with no mortgage,  which is a big benefit for me.

I was awarded a $15/month SNAP benefit.  So how far does that go?

Well,  Seattle charges an arm and a leg for water,  sewer and garbage service,  and charges a lot for car license tabs as well.  However,  since I am on SNAP,  I get a discount of about half on my WS&G bill and a rebate of $20/year on renewing license tabs.  I get internet service from COMCAST for $10/month as negotiated with Seattle.

I already get bus fares reduced from #2.75 to $1.00 as a senior,  but if I didn't SNAP benefits would get me a similar cheap fare.

I visit the local food bank once a week,  which provides a lot of food.

I also dumpster dive a couple of nearby grocery stores.  One provides me with more meat than I can eat  (that included a rib eye steak and a whole ham I'm still eating off of a couple of weeks ago).  The other provides me with far more fresh fruits and vegetables than I can eat.  I usually pick out ten pounds of oranges and a bunch of lemons and limes to squeeze on my  Mixmaster Model 12 mixer with the citrus squeezer attachment I have.

In January, 2019 I signed up for a CNC Machining Class offered at a nearby college.  I completed the three quarter certificate program there at the end of the summer,  with the State of Washington picking up the $1800/quarter tuition costs  because I'm on SNAP.

11ow83g,Tasks required for Florida EBT is like a job itself,"This applies to people who are under 50, not disabled with no children 

I was laid off and I’m looking for a new job. I applied for food stamps and was approved for 3 months ($251 month), but I also had to go see a case worker at the careersource  center.  For those who are under 50, not disabled with no children, you are required to do 80 hours a month of tasks of their choosing.

1. You see case worker every 2 weeks in person. You have to apply for 39 (yes 39) jobs every 2 weeks, you have to print out proof for each job you applied to (yes 39 separate pages, as well as write it all out on a form) and bring it to your meeting. If you don’t have a computer or internet you can go to the center and do it there.

2. You have to complete 20 hours of online education every week. You can choose from several topics - accounting, IT, healthcare, childcare, legal, etc. Again, if no computer you’ll have to go to the center to do it 

3. You have to attend in person workshops monthly. I believe it’s mandatory to do at least 2. Job prep,  interview prep, resume help. Each workshop is at least an hour plus commute.

I understand the goal is to get a job. A lot of these things are helpful. But it’s a lot to do for $250 a month. Which barely helps. When you add up the 80 hours of online classes, the workshops, the 2x a month caseworker meetings…. It’s kind of ridiculous.

umvc7s,"Several very cheap, nutritious, and tasty meal options when relying on EBT/SNAP","I attended 2 different Culinary schools and have a BAS in culinary arts, but am only a hobbyist, as working in the industry started to quickly ruin my love for cooking. Anyways, I have been trying to find meals with the best ratio of price vs # of servings vs nutrition vs yummies, and while I am still playing around with some meals, but I wanted to throw out a few suggestions. 

All of the prices are from Amazon Prime Fresh, which accepts EBT/SNAP in California at least, not sure about other states, and does not require a prime membership if using EBT. Prime Fresh has been a life saver, letting me have teh chance to really think about what I am buying and adding up prices, rather than having to worry about getting to checkout and not having enough EBT... They also have a lot more items, and the deals are better, plus you get free delivery to your door. 

The first meal is Tuna Salad.

On Amazon Fresh, these are the ingredients/prices:

StarKist Chunk Light Tuna In Water, 11 oz Pouch StarKist Chunk Light Tuna In Water, 11 oz Pouch $4.79

Kraft Real Mayo Creamy & Smooth Mayonnaise (12 fl oz Bottle) $3.19

Amazon Brand - Happy Belly Sweet Relish, 10 Ounce $1.19

Celery 1 Bunch $1.99

Yellow Onion $1.19

Final Price: $12.35 However, You can get several salads out of the ingredients, minus the tuna, so I suggest you get 2 or 3 of the 11 oz Tuna Packets.. One of them makes enough Tuna to last 5 days with 2 people, eating 2 sandwiches a day..  The biggest issue is that Tuna salad has a fridge life of 5 days, meaning you might not even be able to finish it all. $16 for 2 weeks of food... Not bad. 

Another affordable meal, (can be a meal or an ingredient) is Brussel Sprouts.  You can get a 12 oz bag of trimmed brussel sprouts for $2.99 and all you need is some kosher salt and butter... Melt the butter in a pan, trim the bottom stem off the brussel sprouts so they cook evenly, cut in half and place in the pan with a decent pinch of kosher salt over them. Let them cook until brown or almost looking burnt, then flip and continue until they are soft and easy to eat. Most people can't believe just how yummy they are when fried or baked (never boil, icky), plus cheap, and amazingly.... a 12 oz bag has 145 calories only, which can easily feed 2-3 people, giving you a filling snack at under $100 calories...  

If you want to take it further, you can go the Bubble'n'squeak route by adding a couple eggs after they are done cooking and some cheese.. 3 eggs and some cheddar only adds 250 calories to the meal.. and an 18 pack of eggs is under $5, and cheese varies a lot but can be found cheap too. 

I have also managed to get my EBT to last longer by getting Slim Fast shake powder $8.79 plus the price of dairy, I get the 96 Oz Vanilla Almond Breeze for $4.09. this gives you 14 meals for $12.88 and is actually pretty effective at weight loss, as long as you stick to the 4 100 calorie snacks and one meal a day, else your body starts to hold on to more fat  and it backfires. This is where the Brussel Sprouts come into play, as 100 calorie snacks. 

For a quick and cheap meal. Stir Fry Rice-A-Roni is $1.09 a box, and  actually pretty good.

And finally, Bear Creek Soups. They range from $3.59 to $4.79, and make 8 LARGE servings of incredibly yummy soup that takes 15 min or so to cook, just pour in the mox, add water and boil. However, One of the BEST meals they have is the ""Damn Good Chili"" but that does require 1lb of ground beef and a small can of tomato paste, but it lasts for several days and is really good chili. Other than that, I highly recommend the Cheddar potato and Cheddar brocolli, though all of the soups are really good, better than any canned soup, and they have at least 15 different flavors.

x42vlt,Rules update: Soliciting or offering personally identifiable information,"Good morning, or evening, or whatever time of day it is where you are.  :)

This isn't a new concern, but it's come up from time to time, and the other mods and I felt it was appropriate to clarify, update the rules, and explain to the community what the change is and why it's being made.

A core concept with working in a human services capacity is the adherence at all times to a high ethical standard, and protecting personally identifiable information from misuse.  

In the sidebar, it says, ""All program experts participating are doing so in their private capacity - no advice given here should be construed as speaking on behalf of any federal, state, or local agency.""  The reason this is there is because Reddit is not an official channel for information to get from Agency to customer or vice versa - it's anonymous, and needs to stay that way.

If you have questions, you should never, under any circumstances, provide your personally identifiable information to someone on Reddit. This puts you in a compromised position, and opens you up to the possibility of having that information misused, stolen, or otherwise compromised....and you should be aware that there is a growing ""recovery scam"" where scammers will ask for your information, knowing that you're already vulnerable.

If you're an expert, or you work in human services and want to help - people asking for help here need to be directed back to their local agency if it gets beyond general program help or advice.  You should never solicit or accept personally identifiable information - doing so means you are no longer operating in a private capacity, because you're offering to use your professional credentials without a valid business purpose, for someone whose identity you have not confirmed.  This poses a risk to this subreddit, to you personally, and potentially to either the customer who is asking for help, or to someone seeking to misuse that information.  Because Reddit is anonymous, providing them any help from that risks a disclosure of protected information, completely aside from HIPAA.

I’m not sure if this works at every Safeway but give it a try. If you feel embarrassed if you are declined just grab a bag of chips. Ask them to scan that to pay for it there so if your drink doesn’t get covered at least they’ll just think you were trying to use your benefits only for the bag of chips. It’s worth a try. 
I also use the ‘Fetch’ rewards app to scan my receipts for my EBT purchases and any other purchases. You can get rewards gift cards after getting up to a certain amount of points. 
Also if you’re trying to get valentines for your kids ‘usually’ any valentines with food in it (candy usually) is eligible for EBT. 
If you can not shop at your store because you don’t have time or physically can’t or whatever your reason then just know with Safeway pickup and Walmart grocery pickup you can order through the app and use your EBT card. I like this better because it will decipher what items are eligible for EBT and what ones are not.

It's been nice having extra money to be able to go buy things for our son, we were finally able to upgrade him to a toddler bed. Our renewal came up during this so we had to report the last two pay stubs. I just don't understand why they can't look at the hourly pay rather than the gross income for the single month. This isn't permanent. He'll go back to making what he did as soon as they fill positions. I understand that it's policy but it's like we're being punished for having extra money for other things aside from cost of living.

This is what it says: "" A bag fee may be added to your final total if required by law or the retailer. The fee will be visible on your receipt after delivery. ""

I called them back to ask again. The next person I got continued to tell me the same thing, however, after checking on the [seattle.gov](https://seattle.gov) website this is what it says under exceptions:

* The fee may not be collected from anyone using a voucher or electronic benefits card issued under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Food Assistance Program (FAP).

Please be aware of phishing and skimming schemes that have increased significantly in volume across the nation in recent months. Protect yourself and your card because SNAP funds are not replaceable in most states due to federal rules.

***Skimming*** devices placed on ATMs and points-of-sale (where you swipe your card, including grocery and convenience stores) record your EBT card number and personal identification number (PIN). That information is then used to create a copy of your card (called a *clone*), which is then used to withdraw cash funds or make SNAP purchases from your account. 

**Protect yourself from** ***skimming***. Do a quick scan before using any machine, take a look to make sure it hasn’t been tampered with.  Check the keypad or swiping device (called an *overlay*) to see if it's loose, if the numbers are hard to press, or if anything else looks suspicious. **Change the PIN** **to your card** as often as you can, and use a different PIN each time.

***Phishing*** schemes begin with an email, phone call or text message to cardholders telling them that their card has been 'blocked' or that there is some other problem with their card. The messages provide a phone number or other way in which you are asked to provide your EBT card number, PIN or other personal information. These messages and the phone numbers they ask you to call can look and sound **very similar to ones you receive from your SNAP agency but they are fake** systems designed to steal your information. 

**Protect yourself from** ***phishing***. Do **not provide your** **PIN to anyone, ever**, including your SNAP agency or caseworker. Your SNAP agency will not (and should not) ever ask your for your PIN.",kmimr,1660395417.0,foodstamps

icv19y,Venting. Roommate lied on his snap application & did fraud and now uses all his ebt to buy soda and red bull..,"My roommate who never once paid rent as agreed (can't evict yet due to covid law!) got food stamps about 3 weeks ago.  He lied on his application.  He told them that he was making his own food and buying it separately so that his app wouldn't be based on his other roommates' wages. If he used our info on the application, he'd have been denied.  He marked down that for the past 6 months he's been buying his own food.  Thus,  he got retro pay.  It was a lie. 

 He never once cooked or bought food. My other roommates and I fed him 3 meals per day, plus snacks and drinks. He never once bothered to help cook or clean after eating. 

I told him 3 weeks ago that he needs to contact our county's welfare board and explain that he will not be using the retro pay,  as it's illegal, but that he could still use future SNAP, as long as he didn't share food with us.  He had replied that he doesn't care if he goes to jail. I explained that he put me in a bad spot! He only thinks of himself.   How about the fact that now I have this weighing on my mind that he was stealing from those who needed it??? And that he got retro pay that he banked off of, when the ""retro"" reality was actually all my money spent on him?!

So,  I reported him to SNAP.  I don't really feel bad. I even warned him that I would be reporting him if he didn't comply.  He knew he was making me feel uncomfortable.  He also isn't starving.  He spent all the back pay on convenience-store-purchased Red Bull and a TON of soda. I'm talking about $35 a day just on soda.    Granted, he did buy a few Banquet frozen dinners. The bulk was candy bars.  That's what he's eating all day.   

How is it even legal that he can buy nothing but Red Bull and soda?  He's clearly taking advantage of the system.  How are there not ""caps"" on certain items? Surely,  one does not need 3 cans of Red Bull per day.  That's also bad on his heart. And $10/ day on nonsense.  I understand you may think it's none of my business what he spends his EBT money on,  but it sort of is.   Regardless,  the SNAP program is broken.  


 Now he ran out of snap and expects to eat here. Like I'm gonna turn away a hungry person? He knows I won't turn him away because I have a heart,  but I'm enabling him. He put me in a catch 22, preying on my weakness.  He's soon to be legally evicted,  as the courts here are finally starting to hear cases again after its ~6 month hiatus.

e6rc8k,What Does the New Food Stamp Rule About Work Requirements Mean for the Program?,"Hey everyone,

You've likely heard that there's a new final rule regarding work requirements for the food stamp program that is slated to go into effect in April 2020. I'm here to tell you what that means for the program.

First, here's [the USDA's press release on the rule](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-120419). 

**What the rule changes**

Some food stamp participants (able bodied adults without dependents) must work 20 hours/week to receive benefits. States have been able to waive the work requirement in areas (e.g. regions, counties) for reasons like high unemployment. This helps people stay on the program during economic downturns. During the recession, every state but one waived work requirements in at least part of the state. 

The new rule:

1. Only allows states to waive work requirements if unemployment is at least 6%, *and* is 20% higher than the national average. This is a higher standard than before.

2. No longer allows states to waive the work requirement based on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. States must rely on historical unemployment data, which can take a little longer to acquire. 

**Who the rule affects**

Anti-poverty groups estimate that about [700,000 people will lose program benefits](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/new-snap-rule-would-cost-many-of-nations-poorest-their-food-aid) because of the new changes (some areas will no longer be eligible for the waiver, and so the work requirements will kick that many people off the program). The USDA estimates that this will save about $1 billion per year (the program currently costs about $65 billion annually). 

**What happens now**

As I mentioned, the rule is slated to go into effect in April 2020. What's likely, however, is that the USDA will be sued by anti-poverty organizations, which will delay rule implementation while the courts determine whether the rule is legal. 

We recommend checking back in March 2020 to see whether the rule will go into effect. If it does, and you're in an area with waived work requirements, check with your state agency to determine whether you'll be affected by the change.

~~I'm speculating without any direct guidance from FNS, but based on what we saw recently, here's what I believe the end of the government shutdown means for the program for the next few months~~:

EDIT 1/28/19 @ 4:30 EST: I was able to confirm via FNS that the following information is true. FNS is also concerned about the 40+ lag in benefits for some participants and is weighing possible options.

EDIT 1/31/19 @ 9:30 EST: Q&A from FNS: https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/snap/SNAPFacts1-29-19.pdf

* The three week continuing resolution (CR) ends on February 15

* All February benefits are guaranteed (ongoing cases should have received theirs as early issuance in January-- **HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVED EARLY ISSUANCE WILL NOT RECEIVE MORE BENEFITS IN FEBRUARY WITHOUT SOME SORT OF FNS INTERVENTION**)

* This means that any financial obligations owed by the government (such as food stamp benefits and admin dollars) can be paid out for the 30 days following the (CR), or until **March 17, 2019**

* Therefore, March food stamp benefits should be guaranteed and paid out as normal

* ~~If there is *another* government shutdown following this CR, then April benefits could be paid out by March 15 as early issuance~~ Another shutdown was averted and an appropriations bill was passed that is good through the rest of the federal fiscal year (until October 2019).

**Upshot** ~~I believe FNS will confirm next week that~~ March/April benefits will be guaranteed for ongoing cases and recertifications that are processed before March 15",thesongofstorms,1548483871.0,foodstamps

y7nnd7,My experiences for dealing with EBT theft. (California),"Hi, everyone! Today as of 10/18, I’ve finally got my stolen amount reimbursed into my EBT account, here’s what I go through with the whole process: 
1. When you found out your EBT cash benefit was stolen, first thing you need to do is call the number at the back of the EBT card and talk to a customer service representative to report your card has been skimmed, and tell them how much money has been stolen, remember to ask for a claim number.
2. Go to the police station and file an report, in my case I went to the sheriffs department. Make sure you mention to the officer, the report is for EBT theft and it’s requested by county worker.
3. After you gather those two informations(Claim number and police report), you can go to your nearest social service county office to fill out the EBT2259、EBT2259A、PA1130、PA853 forms. The good things for fill out those forms in county office is, the county workers will help you fill out those forms and make sure there’s no mistake while you fill those out; they will give you a “receipt” saying that they receive those forms and police report, and they can issue you a new EBT card, so you don’t need to wait for the new card in mail.
3. Give it about 20 business days, if you don’t receive any letters regarding the claim, you need to call the DPSS customer services number. Because they are overwhelmed by the large number of EBT theft cases now, sometimes your claim might be left behind, when you call in the customer service just mention that you don’t receive any letters or follow ups for your EBT card claim, they’ll leave a note in the system or expedite your case movement.

For my case, it took 28 days for the stolen benefit to be reimbursed. 

Edit 1, I’m in Los Angeles county.

Edit 2, thanks for the heads up from u/SweetPotatoeArt! You need to file the claim with county within 10 days.",jaydenye,1666139095.0,foodstamps

*I sent renewal on Nov 22, 2020

*I sent documents on Nov 23, 2020

I did not receive any notices or any request for
 any other documents.  Not by mail, not by
 email.

My food benefits are deposited on the 3rd of every month. 
* December 3rd, they were not deposited? 


I called 211Texas, after being on hold for 59 minutes, ( on a pre paid  limited minutes phone)
The person I spoke to said, they didnt get deposited because I have to do an interview,
which is scheduled for Dec 8. 


At the end of July, after weeks of fighting to reinstate my benefits that had been wrongfully suspended in May, HHS agreed that the suspension was an error. But I had to go through the application process anyways, after completing that, and having an interview, my benafits were reinstated, but for only half the amount I had been getting. 
Just grateful for anything.
* Done *


August I moved into a apartment after being homeless, so I had to submit a change. 
I submitted the change, then I had to send lease, bills, income. Hit several bumps in the road, but completed that.
* Done *


November received a notice to renew my Snap and then another notice to renew my Medicaid.
Completed that on Nov 23, but now again bumps in the road.  I dont understand why I would need to renew Snap at this time anyways?
I did the application and interview just 3 months ago, sent all required information.  Then again 2 months ago when reported the move, and update on the new living expenses, sent everything then as well. 


Now, no benefits for December, I will never get back on my feet with these problems with HHS, that result in disconnected utilities, late fees, reconnection fees, or hungry kids. 

Can someone please tell me what if anything I can do? Its only Dec 6, and Im already having to use money that is supposed to  be used on our electric bill on food, so by the next deposit day Jan 3, ( if theres no other problems after doing an interview), I will for sure be behind on rent, and have lost utilities.

It seems like you only get a large SNAP allotment if you have basically no money at all. I just thought it would be more generous than that.,genzero205,1678556207.0,foodstamps

In a nutshell summed up - grants for smaller companies / retailers to help bring them on board with online SNAP. I REALLY REALLY hope this goes on to include things like CSA's / online ordering from local vendors. 

But they also offer this tantalizing clue - 

>USDA is currently developing a [pilot program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/mobile-payment-pilot) to allow SNAP consumers to use their phones to purchase groceries at the checkout counter and will soon seek states to participate in this pilot.

&#x200B;

So it sounds like the ability to use SNAP via a saved card with things like scan & go WITHOUT having the physical card present to swipe. I'm not sure how I feel about this - on one hand it seems like it would free up a LOT of time in store for a lot of folks via the use of scan & go to see as they go along totals etc. But it also seems like a huge risk for fraud.

I pay $500/rent, $250-400/utilities, $50/phone, $250/car and insurance, $120/medical insurance(can't get medicaid/care) and only made $1500 a month and now got a hour reduction making it to where I only make around $1300 a month. 

I work from home, BUT it's self-employment, contract work. I used to have unlimited hours I could work, but now it got cut to 40/week and now it's cut to 30/week with send offs. I average around 25 hours a week, sometimes less - which makes my checks even smaller than what I've been making.

The study is available [here](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/barriers-constrain-adequacy-snap-allotments) but I'm including the top level talking points:

1. Overall, 88 percent of SNAP participants
reported facing some type of barrier to
achieving a healthy diet throughout the month. 

2. The most common barrier overall, reported by
61 percent of SNAP participants, was the
affordability of foods that are part of a healthy
diet.

3. Other environmental barriers, reported by
nearly 20 percent of participants, were lack of
transportation to a grocery store or the distance to
a grocery store. 

4. The most common individual or household barrier,
reported by 30 percent of participants, was lack of
time to prepare meals from scratch that are part of a healthy diet

5. The prevalence of most barriers did not vary
by household composition, income sources,
education level, urbanicity, or region.

6. Two barriers – affordability and lack of
cooking equipment or storage – were
associated with household food insecurity.
Participants facing an affordability barrier were
2.3 times more likely to experience low or very
low household food security. Participants
reporting lack of equipment or storage were 1.6
times more likely to experience low or very low
household food security",thesongofstorms,1624553432.0,foodstamps
o20k0i,Fraud investigation,"I don’t think I’ve ever posted to Reddit before, so I hope this post comes out ok. My husband’s employer received a letter requesting his wage documents as I’m being investigated for fraud for our SNAP benefits (Louisiana). I did do a recertification in March in which I put that he had quit his second job and I’m pretty sure I had to put in his income for his main job. They denied us which was fine because I figured his slight raise disqualified us. We got the letter last night from his HR dept and I’ve been sick to my stomach. I went on the online portal to see if I could look at my simplified report I sent in March and make sure I put everything in correctly, but it wasn’t available online. I did then see a notification that said my simplified report was sent back incomplete, but I didn’t see that notification earlier than yesterday and received no mail regarding it. All I can think of is that maybe I mistyped something? 

I then looked at my case file online. It had another person added to it that has the same first name as my 2 year old with a last name that is very similar (one letter off) and whole other SSN. I still have a copy of my application and I NEVER added this person. She’s listed to be in her 60s, her income is not being used to determine our eligibility it says, and she “moved out” the home it claims. I have no idea who this woman is or why she’s on our case file, but I do have proof from my original application that I never claimed to have this person living with us. 

Could all of this be one big computer glitch? I was up all night from the stress and I’ve been sick all day. I’ve never been arrested for anything much less accused of a crime. I’m absolutely terrified and the fraud investigator hasn’t called me back yet.

Now being investigated for fraud. Rude rep on phone interview. What’s gonna happen from here?



Ok so I was really stupid for not looking into the rules of EBT. I asked a friend on the phone and they said yes I could use in another state so I didn’t bother to look further into it. I know I was very wrong there. 

Back in April I received a call from super nice woman in fraud investigation informing me my account was flagged and in a perfect world I would’ve notified her. I told her I wasn’t sure when I was coming back since everything was moment to moment with me even being out there in the first place aka unplanned af. 

In an emotionless world based solely off facts and rules, I can understand how she had little patience for me and assumed I intentionally committed fraud. 

I guess I’m wondering now how the investigation process goes and what to expect from here? Will anything be sent to the address of my family friend? Am I eligible for EBT in the state I’m in now with a CA drivers license? — out of state DL was part of the reason I didn’t apply for one out here. I wasn’t sure how the process worked with out of state DL and couldn’t get ahold of anyone at local EBT office without giving my personal info out and I didn’t want to be flagged for fraud by asking about out of state stuff.

j53uuq,[CA] Need advice re how to come clean - accidentally committed fraud,"Hi Reddit, I recently discovered that I have accidentally committed fraud by not reporting income and have been pretty stressed. I do intend to ""turn myself in"" and try to come clean but am wondering what's the best way to approach this.

A little background: my spouse worked a minimum wage job in the food industry (no tip position) and her hours varied every week, anywhere from 15-25 hours. I am a contract worker so it's always a famine or feast situation, and needless to say my income fluctuates a lot.

2019 was a very dry year for me, and I only worked a total of 2 months by the time my spouse and I applied for CalFresh for the first time in November 2019. I just took a look at our original application and we put $8K for her yearly income, and $15K for my yearly income. Both numbers were estimates based on our situation at the time.

I am not exactly sure how/why it happened this way but our application was under my spouse's name with her as the main contact. She was the one who got interviewed on the phone and got approved, etc, but I am actually the one handling finance in our household. So here comes the problem - I knew nothing about the program and didn't bother to look into our responsibilities... Soon after we were approved, I actually got another job which lasted till mid December. My spouse's situation stayed the same. The idea of reporting change of income never even crossed our mind.

Fast forward to 2020, my spouse's situation is still more or less the same but I again worked a contract job from Feb to April (did not report), and lost the job due to COVID before I went on unemployment in early April (also did not report).

We received a recertification letter recently and that's when I realized that I should have 1) reported my UI benefit and 2) reported change of income while I had my contract jobs (my income was $0 when we applied for CalFresh). Our 2019 tax filing shows $31K gross income, which is $8K more than the estimate we put in our original application. We obviously are not wealthy and had zero intention to cheat the system but am not sure if they'll believe us.

Our phone interview is scheduled for 2PM on Thursday and I want to be on the phone as well so I can explain the situation as it was only me who had a change of income significant enough to affect our eligibility.

Where do I even start? UI because they certainly see that in their system? What do I even say about my contract jobs and reasons for not reporting them months ago? We stopped using our EBT card immediately after this realization and will fully cooperate to pay back anything we owe. I just don't want this to become a legal/criminal matter and have it on my record.

Last question - we do not want to be considered for renewal. We actually decided to move abroad after the holidays (lots of self reflection during Covid). How do I withdrawal/request for our case to be terminated?

I am happy to report, that you were right. My fears were unfounded. I just got back from the grocery store (with my mother in tow, because she's kind enough to drive me places when I need from my apartment), and nothing went wrong at all. I pulled it out, nobody looked at me with the evil eye. Nobody whatsoever made any snide remarks, and the cashier and bagger were both very, very patient with me and compassionate. I admit, I wear oxygen and, even being young I do.. well.. LOOK disabled, even physically due to my lung issues, but...  I just pulled out the card, and swiped it. It worked like magic.  


I'm so happy now. I have no reason to worry. My groceries are taken care of every month now. I no longer have to worry about losing my grocery budget in case a medical emergency came up.  
My pantry and fridge are FULL. I will be able to sleep so well tonight knowing that I no longer have to worry about feeding myself.

They had initially said they could only pay 64% of February's food stamps benefit obligations should the shutdown continue into February. 

""The agency initially guaranteed funding for the program, which serves more than 38 million people, only until the end of January if the partial government shutdown isn't resolved sooner.

The department says it is now using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse, and is working with states to issue February's food stamp benefits -- which are expected to total $4.8 billion -- by January 20.""

Obviously $300 would make her eligible, but probably not the $2400?

I was reciving requests from SNAP well after a month that I had applied, but that I needed to verify some things. By the time I recovered at home to start looking up my bills and see if unemployment had payed me anything yet etc I saw their request in the mail. So I missed their deadline for 5 days.

Now their original request said :

Information/Action Required
Expenses are greater than income. 
Please provide information as to how you 
are paying your bills. 

Acceptable Verification/Proof
You must provide verification of how you are meeting your expenses or proof your expenses are not paid

So I talked to a rep after that, I sent them my missed mortgage house payments, the mortgage is 1141 of the missed payments, but I wrote 1400 in ""shelter costs"" since I was including HOA.

That page says ""Costs that lower your income"" (deductions) 
Cost 1,400.     Deduction. 586

They sent me a new letter saying:

Expenses are greater than income.
Please provide information as to how you are paying your bills. Provide verification of your mortgage payment. 

What changed was the amount in their ""Costs that lower your income""(deductions)

It says now, Shelter 360, deduction 360.

So it seems like they adjusted my shelter costs and now they want to see how the remaining 360 are paid?
Or they want to know how did I afford to pay stuff if my expenses were greater than income?

I thought of sending them the statement where it shows unemployment was paying in December but then they stopped in December, so I then applied to SNAP because I was unsure if I was going to get unemployment back.


What should I do and not do? I am having a very slow recovery from covid, I don't have the energy to be dealing with all the extra stress. I really need the help. Unemployment has paid whenever they want to then stop paying again. 

I am not sure if what I posted make sense. I am just hoping to get advice from people that was in the same situation and how they resolved it.

One of the most destructive narratives that has emerged since the pandemic is that food insecurity is some kind of new phenomenon in the U.S.  I believe too many stories are written about the mere existence of these realities as if they haven't existed before (this speaks to a broader issue about how media organizations are built and how they cover communities unfamiliar to them). 

What is important to me is how people are adapting in these increasingly challenging times and what role government assistance plays in that. If I can promise you anything, it is that I will listen carefully about your experience with the SNAP program and how it factors into your everyday life.

If this interests you, please DM me. I think it's important that the public is better aware of how the SNAP and (P)-EBT programs are designed and how individuals interact with them.

Thank you!",gb914,1611159004.0,foodstamps

ipfjaw,SNAP disaster relief & replacement of used/lost benefits.,"The currently unfolding situation here in Oregon and California with the fires brings to mind something I thought I'd put up a reminder of.

SNAP benefits already used in the current month can be replaced by the issuing agency, if you can show that the food purchased with SNAP was lost due to something catastrophic and beyond your control - wildfires, flooding, home fire, hurricanes,  tornadoes,  etc. Agencies differ on what they'll ask for in terms of verification - Oregon historically takes a very lenient view, but other states may do it differently. 

To get this moving,  typically, you would want to make contact with your area's agency, and ask - explain your situation and ask what they'll need.  You'll probably need to know when and where,  and about how much,  you spent to start off with.",slice_of_pi,1599656821.0,foodstamps

faia26,How to get case re-opened,"My case has been closed for about 3 weeks after a renewal. After 3 weeks of constant friendly contact with my local DFACS (GA) my benefits have been reinstated. I wanted to share how. 

1. Upload AND hand deliver requested documents in a timely manner.
2. Make sure you get receipt via screen shot for uploaded documents and a receipt for hand deliveries. 
3. Always remain polite and pleasant, we are all humans and they have difficulties in life as well. You will brighten their day with your optimism.
4. Call and leave a message to your caseworker often. If they haven't contacted you in a few days, call their supervisor. These are need based programs and many people apply so keep contacting them. 
5. Go to the office  or call and confirm that the caseworker is available and see if the receptionist can set up an appointment for you to speak with your caseworker.
6. If you haven't received any letter or phone call, contact the supervisor of the supervisor of your caseworker to let her know what's going on. 
7. I know it can be frustrating because we apply for these benefits because we are in need, but remain polite, friendly and always have proof for any income you receive, so as to not have any delay in benefits.
8. Many times in my area caseworkers make mistakes and close cases, look over your paperwork for any inconsistencies and try to self-edit. If your caseworker states any untrue info regarding what you sent in or that they didn't receive it, kindly inform them of the receipts. Hopefully your case will be re-opened and you get the benefits your family needs Good luck!",becomingjubilant,1582835065.0,foodstamps

He told me to upload a letter stating how much money my parents give me a quarter to pay for food.

cgm74d,Just approved for CalFresh - I have some questions about using the EBT card...,"I just got approved for CalFresh (California version of SNAP) and am now waiting on my EBT card in the mail.  I have a few questions... they seem really dumb and obvious, but I've been searching around the Calfresh site and the wiki here and am finding no answers.  Forgive me if they're common questions, maybe my search-engine skills are especially bad today.

1. I know I can only buy food and even then there are restrictions (no eaten-in-the-store type foods, etc.) and the person doing my interview said ""it just won't work if you try to buy toilet paper or something with it.""  Ok.  What happens at the check-out of the grocery store if I accidentally have an item that isn't covered?  Does the whole payment get rejected and I have to use an alternative payment for everything?  Or does it notify the check-out person that the amount of the non-food item has to be paid for another way while putting the allowed items on the EBT?  Something else?

2.  Similar to the last question... if I'm close to using up my monthly balance, and accidentally get a few items that put me over that balance, does it reject the whole thing, or inform me and the checkout person that I have to pay for the rest with another method?  Something else?

3. I'm guessing the answer to this must be yes, but does the check-out person at the grocery store see that I'm paying with Calfresh/foodstamps?  I kind of know some of the checkout people at the store I usually go to and I know it shouldn't matter, but I'd rather they didn't know I am on foodstamps. 

4. I'm guessing the answer to this must be no, but if I don't use a lot of my balance one month, does any of that remaining amount ""roll over"" to the next month?  I assume it entirely resets to the given balance each month, I'd be very surprised if it were anything else, but I'd like to know for sure.

Which I did provide to them, including the formal job offer from my employer stating it’s biweekly pay, $16.50/hr, and it’s a PRN position.  

PRN is as needed.  I schedule myself for 12 hour shifts at the hospital.  This is suppose to be idea for nursing school students to work around our hectic schedules. I told them I intend to try to work 1 shift per week during school(starts August 20th).  This wasn’t good enough for them.

They want my employer to write on company letterhead a letter stating how much I will be working.  I asked the customer service rep how they can do that when it’s PRN.  She says “ I don’t know, maybe how much other PRN employees work.”  That’s not helpful.  PRN is PRN…I could work 48 hours a week or nothing. 

I haven’t asked my manager to write a letter yet because I don’t know what to ask her to write.  I already had a letter stating this is a PRN position. I know employers hate filling this stuff out, I’ve had major trouble with past employers. What can I do?

nt6y27,Disappointed and annoyed: Just received a delinquent/collections letter,"EDIT: This is Los Angeles, CA 


I'll try to sum this up as best as possible 

Lost my job with Pandemic. Applied and was approved for $186/month. A month later I received a letter stating because of the unemployment $600 bonus I now only qualified for $16. So they said for the first month I how have to pay back the difference. 

It was a joke so I just stopped using it and figured they'd just use the balance I had to cover that. 

A month later I receive a letter saying I still need to pay so I called and spoke to my case worker and she they can't do that and I have to fill out a form to indicate I'm asking for my balance to cover that ""back pay"" 

So I did. This was last year in June  

Today I received a letter saying now my case is delinquent/collections for $179.

I’m a waitress and have been throughout all of this. I have never had a caseworker question me on things. This renewal I have.

My electric bill is in my ex fiancés name because i don’t have the money to put down a security deposit ($432) I have renewed my benefits about 3-4 times since he moved out with his name still on the electricity bill. This month they denied me of food stamps and LIHEAP because his name was on the electricity bill. So I had to send in a renewed lease proving that he wasn’t living with me. My old lease didn’t have his name on it from Oct 2021 and  it ended in Oct 2022. No biggie. Sent in my new lease stating it’s a month to month now for the 2022 year with only my name on it to verify AGAIN that he HAS NOT been living with me for over 2 YEARS. My rent had increased from $925 to $1200. 

I just got a call from the county assistance office (a fill in from my actual case worker) She questioned me as to why my paychecks only state that i make $500. I told her that I’m a waitress and that’s what it shows that i make. I don’t have another way to prove my income. She then questioned me “how do you pay for you things?” I said “It’s pretty much a struggle every month” She goes “Sure it’s a struggle but it doesn’t show or tell me anything” and I said “Well, i’m not exactly sure what to tell you” and then she proceeds to ask me “Does your child’s dad pay child support?” and i said “No he doesn’t” and THEN SHE ASKS ME “Why doesn’t he pay child support “ I SAID “Because i never took him to court for child support?????” She tells me that I need to provide my bank statements for the past 2 months and that if I have anyone helping me that I need to let her know.

I am a little irritated because for the past 5 years I have never had any problems with anything of these situations. I am honest and a little dumbfounded by all of this. I’m actually struggling and need help. I wouldn’t be on it if I wasn’t, like i actually need help.

I began receiving SNAP (CalFresh) benefits this month. I wanted to make this post just to say I am so extremely grateful for this program.

I recently lost my job and got into a car accident shortly after. Living on what savings I have has been stressful. Thankfully, with SNAP, I feel more food-secure and, for the first time in a while, have been able to confidentially stock my kitchen with food. I initially felt embarrassed by the idea and after I finally qualified I wish I would have done it sooner.

Compared to working on my disability claim and unemployment with the EDD, getting CalFresh was a breeze. Their online application system is simple, intuitive and quick. My case worker is pleasant and I didn't feel judged for applying.

For those of you feeling hesitant about the idea, go for it! It doesn't hurt to apply! I also had no idea I could use my card at Whole Foods. And, no more .10 bag fee!

rmngq4,"[Florida] Food Stamps Nightmare, Unjust/Unfair Sanction and Denial!","I have been fighting for two months to only be denied. It started with a letter that was sent to my old address, I had missed an interview for orientation at the workforce center. First, I am both homeless and disabled have been since my husband died during COVID. I received a good cause notice and couldn't get through on the phone for week and a half, so I Faxed a letter stating the good cause 9 days before it was due and submitted it online, so they received it. Then I submitted a change request to update my address and employment status  a whole part time at 150 a week (before Tax) all I have found in 5 month of submitting my resume and applications. 

The site notified me I needed to recertify so I did that too. My account changes to Technical Verification then I started receiving notices. They wanted employment verification I spent weeks trying to get through on the phone and submitted the form my employer filled out. I just started the job, so at the time I had only one pay stub because I get paid Bi-monthly and Submitted that. I got through to them 3 times in a month in a half. All the while the reps telling me ""I see you submitted everything on time your account looks fine"" and ""you should be sanctioned I noted your homeless. 

My address also reverted back to my old one during the month, so I submitted another change.

During last month I missed a phone call for the phone interview because I was working. I called back every day for a week and she never returned my calls. The 3rd and last time I got through the rep said she could complete my phone interview. I affirmed the homeless situation and disabilities during the interview and asked it to be noted because of the pending sanction. ""Everything looks fine"" she says. I would like to note that all my applications state that I am homeless, as well. The day before I get my deposit they send me a letter DENIED Dec and Jan. My original application ended in Dec now suddenly it ends in Jan. Of course, the deposit date has passed so I can forget getting anything this month.

The reason (UNBELEAVBLE!):  YOU ARE RECEIVING THE SAME TYPE OF ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM NO HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM You did not complete the work requirements listed below for the Food Assistance Program - first non-compliance. WE DID NOT RECEIVE PROOF OF EARNED INCOME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILTY 

I called again, took all day to get the call back. That agent told me it because I didn't submit proof of income for October. I said that is because I don't have proof it was a $280 cash transfer for contract services. I have no pay stubs or any way to prove it, she tells me to write a letter and sign it and submit it online. That my account needs to be triggered for reevaluation. She tells me I have to call again and submit a request and of course can't get through.

The notice has documentation that is supposed to ""explain"" why the collection is happening, but it makes 0 sense!   Every field is either 0 or left blank except for the field about the benefits I received. For example, all the income fields say I actually made $0, ok well I didn't make $0 but I did make under the income limit, and if I had made $0 as they claim then why the fuck would that mean that I was overpaid benefits and that I should be receiving $0 in benefits?! That makes no sense! Also it says that there are 0 people in my household. Obviously that is not the case, there is 1 person in my household, me.

The supervisor of the worker assigned your case just contacted me.

According to the supervisor, A County should have discontinued your CalFresh 11/30/19 but they did not. CalFresh in A County needs to be discontinued before you will be eligible for CalFresh in C County.

So then I say:

Why did I get this (attached official notice of county transfer on like 11/20)? I reported my change when I moved using the official forms, and I know that they were slow to transfer it over for some weird reason, but I kept mentioning it to them every time I talked to them and they kept saying they would do it. And also what am I supposed to do about this overpayment claim? Where is the overpayment? If my case is still in A, despite all evidence to the contrary, why does that mean I was overpaid? I haven't gotten additional food stamps to my knowledge, at least that I can access, nor do I have the money to pay the claim, hence being on food stamps. This still explains nothing about the overpayment collection claims. What are the next steps I can take?

and she says:

If the statewide MEDS system is correct as EHSD is assuming it to be, you collected money on A County EBT card for December and January. As of today, you are listed as active CalFresh in A County. Your next step is to contact A County worker. If there was money put on your EBT card for that County, then it is unspent and that is what you can use to pay back C County. Priority is to get your A County case closed or transferred and in so doing, determine what money was paid to you for CalFresh for December and January as you will need to pay back C County. Once A County case is officially closed/transferred, you can reapply for CalFresh in C. You were denied CF in C because you have an open case in A County

and so then I say:

Ok well it wasn't overpaid there and I've also done everything in my power to get my case transferred over here. Like I said I filled out the paper work and then talked to them on top of it many times about changing counties and have gotten acknowledgement that they will transfer my case. Obviously my Medicaid case transferred over, so I don't know why it's claiming this hasn't. I've done my due diligence on this and I literally don't know what else I can do. I'm not a calfresh employee. I can't go into the system and fix whatever the problem seems to be. I've already called and emailed them about this issue like I said and all I've gotten is acknowledgements they they will or have transfered my case... Like I said the paper work I got said it was transferred over here anyway. I haven't seen any double payments to my card. So what am I supposed to do about this threatening letter from C threatening collections? If I was overpaid by A county (which there's no evidence of overpayment from any county, but for the sake of clarity), then why would I have to pay back C county? I do live in C, so even if there was a double payment (which there's not) if anything, A would collect, not C. And no one has given me any proof that there was actual over payment.

So again, what am I supposed to do about this collections letter? Can it be thrown out or do I have to appeal? Are you saying to just ignore it until we get the whole which county is handling my case thing sorted out at least?

And also it's illegal to make me reapply for benefits just because I've moved counties. The law is as long as there's no change in income or other qualifiers I should not have to do that sort of thing till my recertification period.

----

Any practical advice, especially what to do about the collections, which she hasn't addressed at all yet, would be great. 

Despite her ""priority"" being that my old case is ""closed or transferred"", which as I say I've already done everything in my power to do, my priority is 1. being able to eat and 2. not having money stolen/being harassed due to fraudulent collections, so advice on that stuff would be great.

asp6r7,Should I cancel my SNAP and Medicaid assistance?,"After having a phone interview, I'm afraid I may be investigated for fraud since I never mentioned that my child's father is deceased. Since I'm a single Mother attending University, I have been receiving $350+ in SNAP benefits plus Medicaid for me and my child. The interview took place early in the morning so when the interviewer asked for the name of my child's father I accidently told her the name of the man I am dating. Then retracted an told her the name of my child's birth father who is now deceased. She sounded very shocked and...irritated as she repeadedly demanded to know why I wasn't recieving something called social security benefits for my child. I told her I was only interested in recieving Medicaid and SNAP. After putting me on hold for a little while, she instructed me to upload documentation regarding proof of enrollment then abruptly ended the interview. 

I just spent some time researching possible penalties and processes involving SNAP fraud investigation teams, court cases etc. As a full time student and Mom I have zero time to go through something as stressful as this. I can't imagine having to find an attorney and go through the motions of it all. I'm considering just looking for work and canceling any and all assistance from the state. It has been a rocky road dealing with false renewal notices when I already renewed and issues locating my caseworker, etc. Id rather just end it all now.

I always talk to someone in person and take about 4 months worth of pay stubs and explain to them how unstable my income is, it's never been a problem before. But since my renewal fell on November and I made an ""extra"" 200$ that month, they cut down my benefits.

There is a program called the Restaurant Meals Program that allows eligible elderly, disabled and homeless individuals to use their food stamps EBT cards at approved restaurants, including some fast food restaurants. The program has been around since 1977.   


However, states have to opt into this program and so far, only four states participate in the program - California, Arizona, Rhode Island, and Florida.

This is in California. 

I am on SSI, my husband is pending his SSI and not workin. I was getting $1140 a month and $363 for food stamps.

With COLA I now get $1251.00 as of Jan 1. That caused our food stamps to go down to 315. That sucked but okay I can handle it. 

Then, we get a notice that they've gone down to $208 because we no longer pay rent (we bought our property, but our utility costs have gone up, and we live in rural area so gas to get anywhere is more, we can't walk anywhere like in the city, going to the Dr is 160 miles round trip. For example. We pay propane water gas charcoal (no cooking facilities), phone, and medical expenses, car insurance, property taxes. 

So the only expense we no longer have is rent.  But everything else went up. 

Somehow that took our food stamps from 315 to 208.

On the benefits change notice though the income they put is the same, the deductions are the same, expenses listed is the same only difference is the amount of the food stamps.

Earlier this morning, I was able to use my card normally, but I tried to use it tonight and the terminal that I used said my card was declined. Due to this, I contacted the number on the back of my card and entered my card number. I got an automated response asking if I had reported my card lost, stolen, or destroyed and said no. The response I had gotten back said that the card is not working due to the card being canceled which is strange because I never called to cancel it.

I then proceeded to speak with a CALFRESH representative through the helpline and they said that the account is still active and has a balance, along with everything being correct on their end with no issues. They told me to contact the county office tomorrow and get another card issued to me.

Has this ever happened to anyone else ? I find it weird that a card can just be canceled randomly without notice if everything is correct and active. I'm also afraid that maybe someone has my card number and was the one to cancel it, but that doesn't really make sense to me either.

3. How can she possibly work with her taking care of 4 kids?

Your first step is to go to *Benefitscal.com*. Find the link that says *create new account*. keep in mind this is not the start a new application tab!  The create new account hyperlink should be right underneath the log in button.

Set up an email address and password. Answer the security questions (keep in mind it only likes one-worded answers. So if you answer 'what's your favorite color?' just write blue not aqua blue).

You'll receive a verification code via email. Most of the time it doesn't work (known glitch). If this is the case use the one sent via text message. That works 99.9% of the time.

Once you're logged in, find a link that says *link a case*. You can use the last four or your social or your case number. The case number will be case sensitive so make sure all the letters are caps. If there is a zero in your case number can almost guarantee it will but the number 0 and *not* the letter O. it should say ""congrats your case has been linked.""

From there you can explore the site, check your transactions and allotments and complete your paperwork when it's due. It's very useful.

With that income a family of 3 should quality for food stamps in Texas.

 I worry we won't qualify for a couple reasons and If anyone has advice for me I would majorly appreciate it. I'm new to food stamps.

Reason one) 
 We have two vehicles we own
One we bought for $7500 and the other was $4500
We were given money from my husband's grandma and used our stimulus checks to purchase them.
Before we had two old flooded from hurricane Imelda cars that we traded out for the better ones.

Reason two)
With my husband's job that he's about to step down from we've been able to save back $3500 and I'm scared having that much in savings and the cars would disqualify us and it would totally be understandable.

I figure if we get disqualified we could live partly off of our savings until it's gone then I can apply again.

Also our son is Autistic and I tried to get social security disability back in 2019 right before covid started and even with our old flooded out cars and nothing in savings we didn't qualify.

So I spent over $10,000 on video games in 2019 before this unforseen disability has ruined my life. I am now on SSDI and receiving food stamps. I thought I would be okay to sell my video game collection because after all I spent the money on it and have receipts. However, I recently found out I'm not allowed to cherry pick and I must average out all the games that I bought and that is my ""expense"" per disc that I am allowed to deduct.

So for example if I sell a game for $50 I am only allowed to deduct the average game price of $0.97 from the sales price since I bought them in lots and bulk leaving me with a profit of $49.03.

Well I've been selling games all year long and have made a profit of over $4,000 so far...

This would definitely lead to my food stamps going away since I should only be receiving $16 before the boost to whatever the emergency maximum is.

How do I go about reporting this income so late? Any idea what the penalty will be? Will I have to pay back all these months of maximum food stamps?

During this hectic time, to my surprise, I got duplicate assistance for 1 month. I didn't realize I got the duplicate assistance because I wasn't checking my other EBT card. I just spent the money on my 2 kids and me.

That was in September of 2019. Since I've been getting ""paris contact"" letters every 3 months, (these are letters saying I got assistance in 2 states at once and I need to prove my 2 kids and I live in state 2 only). I've been getting these for 1 1/2 year every 3 months and send proof we live here.

&#x200B;

Since it's Summer time now, my kids school can no longer provide me proof of residency and I'm tired of proving something countless times. I call state DCF 2 and they tell me to inquire with state 1. Well state 1 tells me that I did have duplicate assistance for the month of September and they are sending in a claim on that today since they haven't done it.

nkc8io,Spent more than remaining snap balance question,"I am in California.

I had $88.03 left on my SNAP balance and I went grocery shopping and spent $112.21.

I thought it would charge only up to the $88.03 remaining SNAP balance and ask me to pay the remainder in cash/creditcard/etc but it somehow paid the whole thing and even says now I have $65.82 remaining SNAP balance?

I read something about Calfresh SNAP Emergency allotments for $95 but I already had the maximum amount for my household size of one for $234 month.

I did the math and added $95 to my $88.03 remaining balance from my last receipt and subtracted the $112.21 and it comes to exactly the amount it says I have remaining now of $65.82 so I guess you do get the $95 emergency allotment even if you already had the maximum monthly amount for your household size.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I've called DSHS a few times to get this clarified but I'm paranoid to say the least. 

Long story short, I completed my recertification earlier this month and I went from $29 a month to $0. They told me that if maximum emergency benefits are approved I should continue to get the max amount but once that expires we no longer receive benefits. Now, I would normally take what they say at face value but I'm not confident and I'm hoping to hear from someone in my situation that has received benefits with a $0 amount approved. My case appears to be active and per the state website it makes mention of households approved for $0 receiving the full amount but I guess I need reassurance to really feel secure in this answer. I know it's silly but life has been very difficult for us(like many of us) and these benefits have been a life saver for us.

If you buy their offers with food stamps, youd essentially be getting free money back since its not coming out of your own pocket. They also have offers for household and personal products .

a4h4vs,Questions About Trump’s Food Stamps In a Box Idea,"Not sure if you've heard about this but there was a proposal early this year from the Trump Administration to [significantly change](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/12/food-stamps-trump-administration-343245) the food stamps program. The president himself called it a program like Blue Apron style food delivery.  As the year draws to a close and members of Congress are still negotiating changes to the food stamps program, I am curious about how this new program fits into all that. Would like to hear what other people think about this since the press has left that topic alone but I feel like there could be something sneaked out of the lame duck to make these drastic changes the President is requesting. I found [this list of questions](https://foodstampsnow.com/60-questions-about-trumps-food-stamps-harvest-box/) about the program. While some of the questions are over the top, I found the ones below to be important points to addressing if this is where the program is going. Thoughts?  
Who makes the boxes?  
Who decides what goes in the boxes?  
What about fresh fruits and veggies?  
What if you don’t receive your box one month?  
What if you’re homeless?  
What if you don’t have a place to receive mail?  
What if you have allergies?  
Is the value of the box the same as the value of the SNAP?  
What’s the overhead cost?  
Do folks receiving government assistance deserve to get to choose their own food?  
Does the box change based on family composition?  
Will companies be able to lobby to change the contents of the boxes?  
Will the government accept free food from companies?  
What happens during hurricanes? Snowstorms?  
What happens if shipping costs go up?

10zsmym,Required to apply for 20 jobs in the next 10 days even though I quit because of my disability [Kansas],"In December, I finally reached a point where I realized I couldn't work anymore because of my disabilities, and left my job of 2 years. In January, a friend helped me with applying for SSDI, Food Assistance, and Medicaid. Yesterday I got a call from DCF to do my phone interview, and the worker said that I would need to fill out a job contacts form; from what I can see, it looks like it's asking me to apply for 20 jobs and write the contact information for all of them, and then turn in the form to DCF by 02/20/2023. I can try to apply for jobs, but that seems irresponsible knowing that I will be unable to work if I receive an offer. If I knew I could work, I would just go back to my previous job. I asked the worker if it was absolutely necessary for me to fill out the job contacts form in order to receive assistance, and she didn't give me a straight answer. Is there a specific way I should phrase this concern? Should I try again with a different worker?

&#x200B;

UPDATE 02/17/2023:  What ended up working was uploading the confirmation that I had applied for SSDI to the DCF online portal and then waiting on hold (yesterday 02/16/23 it took 6 hours and 19 minutes starting at 8:00 AM, in case anyone from KS is curious about the hold time to talk to a case worker) to explain that I had applied for disability benefits and I couldn't work at this time, so I wouldn't be able to turn in the job contacts form by/on 02/20/2023. The case worker was able to remove the job contacts form requirement and have my case approved!

yd8ga9,[NY] Denied benefits at rectification because it was alleged that I have business that I have no knowledge of or participation in.,"Hi all.

Here's a doozy. I was denied SNAP benefits at my latest re-certification because it was alleged that I have a business that I do not own, didn't start and do not participate in.

I asked in a letter/fax where this information came from and to please furnish me with a copy. It took them 3 weeks to send me an except from a LexisNexis Accurint report that lists a business that started in 2020 at the address I reside at. It doesn't attach the business to me/my name, only to my address. The worker who sent it tried to redact a portion of it but when held up to the light, says that there were no filings associated with this business.

Again, I have no knowledge of this business of any kind.

I sent a notarized letter attesting to the fact that I do not have any interest, ownership, participation or knowledge in this business. I even sent my own personal LexisNexus report that does not list any business of any kind.

My taxes from 2020 and 2021 that I sent also do not have any business of that kind on it. Just my landscaping and scrap metal oddjobs. My bank statements of a full year that I sent also do not in any way reflect that business in question.

Here's the kicker: the worker said that I have this business which she believes is an internet businessand that many people started internet businesses during the pandemic. She then asks for proof that the business is defunct. This is an illogical and impossible request since it would be asking me to prove a negative.

I asked for a supervisor and sent a letter asking for a supervisor to intervene. Never heard anything back. Also asked for an agency conference but never heard back and when I called and spoke to a live person they said they wouldn't grant one but that I should request a hearing instead. So I requested a fair hearing.

I live with another adult family member but have always stated factually that I buy and prepare my own meals.

I believe this started because the case worker on this latest recertification may have noticed at the time that I had over $1000 in benefits left. But that surplus has been there for more than a year but I have been exhausting most of each monthly benefit and that balance stayed more or less the same for almost a year. Thanks to the extra pandemic benefit of $95.

When I reapplied with a new application recently while waiting for my fair hearing, this issue is coming up again. Why? This time they are asking for proof from IRS and State regarding the status of the business in question. I told them that it is impossible for me to obtain something I have no affiliation with and to please refer to my notarized statement.

What is going on?

No investigator ever called or showed up. And this issue has been going on since June. Can't see why an investigator would bother with this since no kids and no fraud is at work. And an investigator can easily look up on state register for any LLC or INC. I did, and no such business exists. If a sole proprietorship, then it would reflect in my taxes which it doesn't. So why are my consistent statements about this alleged business being ignored?

How do I possibly satisfy this issue on their part?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: 10/30/22

So on Saturday morning (10/29), I was checking to see the status of my current SNAP application online and to my surprise, it said, ""APPROVED."" 

&#x200B;

But here's the kicker: when I went to check my SNAP balance, not only did I get the prorated portion from this month (starting from day of the approved application), but also for August and September including the Pandemic $95 for each month. 

I think the person preparing the evidence packet for my Hearing on Nov 2, looked at the situation and realized the error made by the previous caseworker. 

&#x200B;

I guess my fair hearing is moot now. If I get a letter in the mail by Tuesday stating the reasoning why they decided to go back and add the 2 months for which my fair hearing is concerned, I will cancel/withdraw my hearing request. Otherwise, I will have to go forward with it and if the agency decides to withdraw (which by this action already suggests they have), I happily would agree. 

I don't know who to thank at the agency, be it my current caseworker who I had before and she was a gem, or an unnamed supervisor. So I'll just thank them all. It's a hard thankless job.

ya2x74,FL SNAP - caseworker may be using incorrect amounts (Gross instead of Net),"I've been struggling with my application process since early July, the online submission and update process is not great and I feel like the system is purposely more difficult than it needs to be.

Trying to get through on the phone interview is as difficult as everyone knows...and this was prior to Hurricane Ian.

My spouse is disabled so the means testing is scaled for that;  you can qualify using the Gross or Net income amounts.  When we initially applied, I was receiving unemployment and was told that our Gross income was too high but nothing was ever said about qualifying using our Net.  I started working two weeks into September so our Income went up by an entire $70.00/month.  

Early this week they finally (!) made a determination on the changes to income I filed in September, we received $86.00 benefit for September with a letter explaining that we don't qualify for October because our Monthly Gross Income is now too high - again, with the Gross Income limits and a mention of an income limit amount that I don't recognize. 

I can't get through on the number listed on the notice letter, a recording says it's no longer available for interviews and I must call the 850 number - but you can't really get through there either because either the system is too busy or if you hold for a representative your call is disconnected.

I know it's especially busy now, if there were a better way of checking the figures on the website I would do it & save the trouble of trying to speak with someone.

About a week ago I finally found another job that pays a couple dollars above minimum wage. However, after plugging in my new information to https://fscalc.dhs.illinois.gov/FSCalc/ I find that I pass the net monthly income test and asset test but I fail the gross monthly income test and my estimated ""Potential monthly benefit amount""

 I am submitting my change of information now, but I am wondering what that process looks like- is my card revoked/my account shut down because I make too much now? Or will my card and account stay active with a $0 balance in case my income changes? Like if I lose this job or my hours get cut. I am only barely making too much to be above the 130% poverty limit. If I made about $100 less per month I'd be below it. 

I'm really hoping the later in case something happens and I lose this job, so I won't have to go through the process again (it took me almost 3 weeks from applying to receiving my card, and a month before getting any funds iirc which is why it scares me).

>	Effective October 1, Pennsylvania will increase the income threshold for all applicants to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines (FPIG). With this change, more than 420,000 additional Pennsylvanians in more than 174,000 households will be newly eligible for SNAP and will receive, on average, $63 a month.

PA families with at least one elderly (60+) or disabled household member were already subject to a 200% FPIG income limit, but for everyone else, the income limit is increasing from 160% FPIG to 200% FPIG.

This change is **in addition** to the annual cost-of-living (ie inflation) update to income limits and benefit amounts, which will also go into effect on October 1.

I’ve been working a lot with limited access to a desktop so I’m just now able to submit my renewal today, 7/30. However, on my account it says my case is already closed. I also received another letter in my notices dated 07/29 stating that my case will be closed 07/31 due to not completing renewal process. My question is, if I still submit my renewal today, will it be accepted / will my case be reopened? I was under the impression I had until 07/31 to submit it before it closed, but they’ve already closed it. Thanks for your help!

ujcirs,"Requsting another caseworker for the 2nd time, will they know?","Long post sorry: I have been going back-and-forth with calworks and CalFresh for a few months. Initially, I was to give my 6 month update. I provided documents both hardcopy (mailed in) and through the online portal that were requested. I received the letter on 3 March that stated everything should be turned in by 5 March. So I mailed in the requested forms, as well as uploaded them in case it didn't reach their office within a day. They ended up disqualifying me, saying they didn't receive my documentation, including what was uploaded online despite the fact that I can see it's there. (Mind you, I was 40 weeks pregnant while all of this is happening, not that they care of course.) I have been trying to get in touch with the caseworker for three weeks, leaving voicemails and waiting to hear back. On one of the voicemails I had requested a new caseworker, as politely and respectfully, so not to offend her because I just assume it's been really busy. Flash forward to now and I had to reapply, including new information like my son being born, and this time my interview took a lot longer to happen. They want verification documents but I still have not received the letter that explains which things they need from me. She said she sent it last Thursday via mail and I still have not received it a week later and we only have 10 days to submit. That leaves me three business days at this point. I really wish I had the caseworker I was given initially because she got everything that I uploaded without any issues, and genuinely seemed to care. The latest 2 caseworkers have just not been on it and I really need the assistance. Would they know if I request a new caseworker, would they make a note of it somewhere so that people could potentially discriminate against me in that way? It already says denied again, and I haven't even turned any of the paperwork in yet for verification. I'm going to just go into the office in person on Monday but still would like another caseworker.",gypc8888,1651801246.0,foodstamps

Would like to pay rent but parents want me to save for retirement (or my own house) instead soo

I've been doing my works 401k which is near 2.5k a year and an IRA which is another 6k for the past two years. About 15k total.

Do they count 401k and IRA as resources over 2k?

I am aware that my husband makes toward the top of the income limit for a family of 4 but we were approved anyway, so great. My sister also gets FNS and explained how the state of NC is giving out maximums no matter your income due to the pandemic. She said I'd get a small amount on the 15th (my deposit day) and then would get the rest toward the end but it would add up to be the max.

I did see that NC has stopped its 15% benefits increase as of October but that really just dropped it down maybe $20-30? So, it's still a decent amount if we were to get the max allotment for a family of 4.

But I just got our approval letter in the mail and we have been approved for $89.

prwsi1,College Student - Pandemic Exemption,"Hi all,

Starting in January 2021, there was federal legislation that expanded SNAP benefits to college students during the public health emergency. It made students who were eligible for work study and who had an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of 0 eligible to receive food stamps.

I applied back in May and was approved. I'm currently a non-Ohio resident going to school in Ohio for graduate school, I was approved for work study, and have an EFC of 0 due to being a grad student.

However, I've had some recent worries about my eligibility. I uploaded all the documents required, such as my bank account, my personal IDs, information about my car and rent payments, student loans, roommate information, so on and so forth. I had a phone interview where they asked me a few questions and then approved me.

I've found some inconsistent information about asset testing-- I found the federal limits for assets regarding bank accounts and assets such as cars, and those financial limits, which I am above. However, I believe I've found information that states Ohio doesn't do asset testing when considering eligibility for food stamps, but nothing concrete. I did find information about income levels, which I am well below as I was unemployed, and I am currently earning \~$400/month from work study (which is not counted as regular income, I believe).

Essentially, I'm worried that I was approved mistakenly because of this special exception, and that it will be found and I'll have to pay the money back. As a grad student, you can imagine that I don't really have much excess money to do so. If anyone who is more familiar with the SNAP program could address my concerns, I would be incredibly grateful.

TLDR: Ohio grad student who is a non-resident of Ohio approved for food stamps, income level is well below poverty line but has assets above the federal limit. Not sure if my residency status or assets disqualify me and I was misapproved and will owe money back.

pqvcu6,CalFresh Fraud Questions,"New here. I recently applied for and received CalFresh benefits. After about a month I got notified that they were being revoked because my qualifying child no longer lives with me. The child does in fact live with me so I filed for an appeal, had a hearing, the county told me during the hearing what specific documents I needed to submit and I have since submitted them. I presume that they will reinstate my benefits but who knows how this stuff goes. 

Now for my life story and questions. 

I am mid divorce. My ex is somewhat unstable. My ex has claimed our child to receive benefits too. We recently went to court and the court ordered that I am to have sole legal and physical custody of the child. The order states that the child is to have about ten hours of supervised time with the other parent. This seems very straightforward that I should be the one that can claim the child for this purpose.

I got a giant packet from the county that had notes of various events in my case and includes references to claims made by my ex spouse about the child custody. The timing of the statements are such that that they were made to the county agent after the date of the court order. To me, this seems like a clear case of my ex spouse committing fraud to the county.

My question is if there is anything I should do to report the fraud apart from doing what I need to prove that I should receive the benefit.  I have provided documentation that shows the custody order and I expect it to be clear. Should I just wait for the county to get back to me?  Should I report the fraud somehow?  Does it sound like this will get sorted out fairly?

I do not want to report my ex for vindictive reasons, but they have been making many many false accusations about me publicly, partly because of un treated mental illness. My goal is not to get them in trouble but I feel like I need to be addressing these fraudulent issues when they can affect me and my child.

Any thoughts?  Thank you!",itsrainingmenses,1632002024.0,foodstamps
pmpwrk,Calfresh/ EBT Overpayment,"Hello,

I have a question regarding my Calfresh EBT/Snap Benefits. I started receiving Calfresh Snap Benefits in September of 2020 after being laid off due to COVID. I was finally called back to work at the end of June 2021. I tried contacting my caseworker but was never able to get a hold of her, so I mailed the information that I was starting up with my job again.

Now I'm in September 2021, I havent used the ebt card since I started working end of June because I thought that because I mailed them my info/income that I would be making, that my benefits would stop. But I get an email asking me to "" renew my application so my benefits do not stop."" The next day, I get a call from a case worker asking if I could complete my renewal application over the phone. I tell her that I am not eligible for Calfresh Benefits anymore because I am working. She asks me to complete it anyway so that I am confirmed denied. Stupid me, I quickly try to get it overwith because I am at work. I answer her questions and even confirm my income that I've recently made from my job for the last 4 weeks.

Few days pass by I get an email to check my enotices on Calwin. I havent logged in a while at this point because I have not been utilizing my ebt card and thought I stopped my benefits. I log in and see that I have still been receivng benefits after June when I reported my wages! I check the enotices, and  see the letter of denial as expected, but I also see this enotice (please see attached).

Has anyone else received this enotice or know what it means? Am I being investigated for fraud? Or is it just a notice that they checked my work records just to determine my eligibilty? It really sucks that I am finding this out on a weekend because I have to wait until monday to call a caseworker and get this straightened out. It's making me kind of anxious having to wait. If anyone has the answer or can put me at ease, I would greatly appreciate it.

oamgxc,Fraud Question again,"**UPDATE*** I was finally able to reach my investigator. I was right that she was just super busy and that’s why it took so long. She was so nice and made me feel much better. Our bonuses may not even matter she said, but if they do we can go on a payment plan if necessary. She said right now with pandemic stuff all of these kinds of issues are being labeled as unintentional errors or something like that.  I feel so much better and I’m no longer getting physically sick from worry. Thanks to everyone who gave advice on this thread and my other one. 

Hi again. I posted not too long ago about being under investigation for fraud. I was very confused as to why and then I realized it was because I completely forgot to report income we earned in 2020. It’s all in my previous post, but to recap: we made very little in 2019 and got on FS January 2020. In 2020 my husband earned a few bonuses through work for his sales numbers. They put us around 5k over in gross income for the year. I just didn’t even think to report it because I’m apparently an idiot and I continued to use our card for monthly groceries. Once I knew we were under investigation I went through everything I submitted and our financials and that’s when I realized my dumb mistake. 
I’ve called the investigator several times, but she won’t call me back. I’m sure she’s very busy, but I feel so sick to my stomach. The kicker is that we received a lot of money each month because of the pandemic. I didn’t use all of it, but I did cover all of our groceries each month with the extra pandemic allotment (around $800 a month). So, I probably owe thousands back for the whole year of 2020. I still have about 5k on the card, but I haven’t been using it even though our income went back down. I just want to close the card out completely. 
My question is, should I just go to my local DCFS office and tell them I realize that I messed up and didn’t report income? I really want to make this right and I’m terrified of criminal charges because of the amount of FS I used. I’m sorry if this post is redundant, but my anxiety is through the roof. I am absolutely terrified. I have a newborn and other kids and the thought of going to jail is horrifying. I’ve never even received more than a traffic ticket before. I’m hoping they let us use the child tax credit money to just pay it all back. I am so sick to my stomach over this. Am I going to go to jail?

ETA: Just for clarification, the bonuses were not monthly income, but a quarterly thing. It wasn’t like he got a permanent raise (at that time- he did in March 2021 but our case closed then and we stopped receiving benefits then).",smilesinenglish,1625016601.0,foodstamps

o61807,California- Weird SNAP interview,"I was on snap last year. Didn’t do my renewal so it stopped. Redid the app and had my interview today 

Between now and then I had a baby. I am not in contact with the father- long story short, I don’t know him. Don’t judge me. My girlfriend (we live separately, finances are not combined) is on his birth certificate- which I haven’t ordered yet. I live with a roommate. We split rent and utilities. Do not share food. One room each. 

Well, during my interview the person asked me for my sons birth certificate and I told her I hadn’t ordered it. She said he would be disqualified then. I told her that was fine, he is only 7 months. She then asked about the father. I told her I didn’t know him. She then asked if he pays child support. I again told her I didn’t know him. She then told me I’m approved PENDING my sons birth certificate and income verification. 

I guess I’m confused. I’m fine with him not being included. I just need food for me. I told her I didn’t have it and she said I need to order it. 

Is this standard? I’m not asking for him to be included in my “household”. I’m not looking for extra money for food. I also am not interested in going after the father for child support. He’s not even on the BC, someone else is. We will eventually do a second parent adoption. 

What are my options here? Do I have to provide his BC? Even if he’s disqualified? She wouldn’t explain much and was pretty accusatory.",business-pitch-1710,1624407780.0,foodstamps

I bought it with inheritance money, cash, in late 2018, so I never had a mortgage. Previously I rented for the duration of being on disability and therefore SNAP.

Starting in 2019 my SNAP started to decrease with reviews. I’ve had 4-5 reviews or interviews in the last 2 years, 3 last year alone, and one formal one just this month. I’m on SSI & SSDI due to my father being disabled which I get a total of $815/mo to live off.

When my amount changed from $194/mo to $114/mo last year I called & asked why. They said it was because I don’t pay rent or a mortgage. The rest of the year, the amount has slowly gone up to $148/mo this year. This month, though, I had a formal review with paperwork and am now awarded $39/mo. I know they’re switching to a new computerized system, but hot damn that’s so little for someone on disability!

I receive medicaid as I have $0 income since May '19. However, Social Security doesn't see me as disabled... I've tried twice.

I haven’t gotten any mail correspondence, but I got a call from the automated system the day before yesterday saying my appointment was at 9:30am on 4/8. I set my alarm for 9 so I’d be alert when the case worker called, but no call came through (I was connected to WiFi with a super strong connection and my phone isn’t set to silence unknown callers, I confirmed). At 9:45 there was still no call so I called the automated line and the app status was “denied due to not keeping interview appointment”....what?!!!! I’ve literally been watching my phone, waiting for it to ring...there are NO missed calls, what in the world??????  I called back and (by nothing short of a miracle) someone called right back! She said the CW will call within the hour, that my case was NOT denied, and that she emailed the CW let her kno I was still waiting for her call. She assured me the CW will definitely call by 6. Of course I never got a call,  and my App status is still saying “denied for missed appt” on the automated line. I requested several calls back and never received one again, I requested my appointment be rescheduled, the automated system said I’d get a call back that I never got. I actually read an article that a year or two ago, caseworkers in Georgia had been accused of denying applicants after falsifying documents, saying the applicant didn’t answer the phone, so they would not have to process the application. I’m positive they are overwhelmed because of our current state, but this is literally what my fear is happening to me. 

I kno it’s a lot to read, and my apologies, I just wanted to be thorough. But if there’s anyone, maybe an existing case worker or someone who has a similar situation they’ve successfully resolved, can anyone offer any insight?? I haven’t worked in 3 weeks, we are VERY low on food, and I’m panicking 😥

UPDATE! Ok so, they really never called me back. But I got up at the buttcrack of dawn to hope that if I called the automated line early I may get a call back this time. It worked again! I got a very nice lady who told me she wasn’t sure why the application was denied and that she doesn’t want to assume anything, but she escalated my case and said do not worry - we are in this together! You’ll get a call back to reschedule as soon as this request is process, just relax and wait for the call. She also gave me CW info that I didn’t get before. I hung up with her and the CW called within 30 seconds! He literally asked me 1 question then said my card is in the mail and in 20 min my case status will be updated. So I think my issue is resolved 🤞🏽Anyone else that is having a similar issue, call the contact number first thing in the am!

f66f5l,"CalFresh Overissuance, but have not spent EBT funds","Los Angeles, California. My parents applied for CalFresh this past fall because they were laid off. They used/spent the food stamp money they received for only a month (October) because they each found a job again. A week after they started work, they went in person to tell their case worker that they no longer needed food stamp assistance. They took their paystubs, and the caseworker told them to email her a copy of one paystub they forgot (I did that for them later that day). After two weeks, they hadn't received notice that their assistance would stop, so my mom called. The case worker had an attitude and said she didn't know about any mail or emails because she hadn't checked her mail in a month, and told my mom they would receive a letter when it's done. Two weeks pass, nothing, so my mom calls again, and someone else tells her she can't connect her to her case worker because she's on vacation and no one else can look into my parents' case until she gets back. My mom got tired of trying and didn't go back in person because no one ever helps and it's frustrating.

Now in February, after I figured out how to set up their online account, I can see that they kept receiving money from CalFresh. It's about to 1k, now. I submitted the semi-annual report (sar 7) for them on Feb 11 with the completed form and uploaded their paystubs (however, it says ""incomplete 2/14/20"" now under case status information).
I'm worried this will probably be considered overissuance, even though my parents alerted the office they no longer wanted assistance. They also stopped touching the money once they found their jobs. 

Q: Will they have to pay back the money, or can we expect that all the money on their EBT/CalFresh account will be taken instead (and they won't have to pay out of their pocket)?

ei075z,$16 a month in food benefits? (Michigan),"This doesn't sound right to me but I'm really not sure, I could be wrong so I wanted y'alls opinion. I have an idea why due to unverified rent costs but I'm really not sure. I received a letter today from DHS saying that I qualify for assistance but only $16 per month.

I currently roughly make $330 a week, 1,386 a month and $16,632 a year. My rent costs $800 per month, $9,600 per year leaving me with $7032 for the year.

I also have an electric, internet, phone bill and transportation costs.

My electric bill it's about $60 a month, $720 a year, bringing the total money I have to spend down to $6,322

My transportation costs about $30 a week, $1,512 a year leaving me with $4,810 to spend for the year

Phone bill is $35 a month, $420 a year. Bringing the total I have left to $4,399

Internet is $60 a month, $720 a year leaving me with a grand total of $3,679 to spend that year.

I don't know what expenses are accounted for when determining what your benefit amount will be but $16 per month seems low to me..I honestly don't know so I wanted to ask your opinions. I saw a link on one of the posts in here about a benefit calculator but cannot get it to work. Not sure why. Maybe it's because on trying to use it on a phone.

Is this correct? She said that if we pulled our kids out of school and had them in a daycare, we could deduct the expenses, but because it was at an actual school that it no longer counts.

I've tried to call my Program Integrity person in the county I'm in now, for weeks, and I've had no call backs and unfortunately never been able to get ahold of her. 

Anyway, my soon to be ex husband apparently put my name on the application and drew EBT benefits January-March while he was unemployed and I was out of the country. When I returned to the US to live with my mom, I applied for food stamps to help me get back on my feet while I searched for a new job (I got a job about a week after I got home, and will have worked 30 days on May 15 and will likely apply again then). They called me when they got the application saying I'd used all my able bodied benefits the last 3 months and they let me know my ex husband had put me on his application. They tried to transfer me to Program Integrity and of course the call dropped. I've left 5-6 messages on her voicemail asking for a call back to discuss the situation but never received a call.

What should I do? Should I call Program Integrity in HIS county or continue trying to call mine? Any advice? He seems determined to make my life miserable...

bbi96r,Michigan food assistance much less than I have been getting for the last decade or so.,"TLDR: Screwed up didnt get reauthorization done in October. Got back on in January but monthly total is $140 a month less. Income and monthly expenses didn't change.

&#x200B;

Have been on food assistance for 9-10 years.  Always the max, maybe a few months here and there with less, but always corrected.  Approved for SSI 5 years ago, max monthly payment. Housing is 450 total, rent and utilities paid in one lump sum. 

Anxiety and procrastination made me miss the due date to get paperwork handed in on time last October.  Finally got it straightened out through an online application at the end of December.  Assistance back on for January, but for only $54 a month, when the last few years it has been $194 or so.  

Called my worker, she confirmed the math lined up, and when I asked why my amount is so much lower she kinda avoided the question.  Asked again, and she said something about a change to deductions. Me paying everything together is causing me to not get all deductions, or something like that.

I guess why I am posting, is to see if anyone else has gone through something like this recently, and did you find a way to fix it.  I'm considering leaving the program, and then going to someone that helps people with the application, but need to check if there's a time limit before i'm able to reapply.

My first SNAP renewal was automatic. I got the letter in the mail stating that it would be from 12/1/22 to 5/31/23. I started my new job on 12/5/22.

 I called to have my Medicaid canceled because my insurance would begin sometime in January 2023. They had me send an email to the worker I was on the phone with and told me it would be canceled. I think I also received something in the mail about cancelation. 

After my first paycheck I called to report my income change and stated that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP. The worker asked for my identifying info and just confirmed that I wanted to stop receiving SNAP benefits. They didn't ask for verification of my increased income though. I thought everything was handed.

The primary issue is all of my documents are in PDF form, but the Access HRA app only allows you to ""Take a Photo"" or ""Select a Photo."" PDFs appear to not be recognized.

Initially I assumed this just meant I needed to convert the PDFs to jpgs, which are recognized by the Access HRA app. Access HRA is able to see the .jpgs in my phone's camera folder, in my screenshot folder.... virtually, all jpgs.

But when I converted my PDFs to jpgs and saved them to those same folders, the Access HRA app still can't find them. I tried PNG files too, just to see if that changed it, but there's still no luck.

I'm 100% certain the newly made and converted files are in the correct folders. I've even tried things like moving them to the screenshots folder, where I can see the Access HRA app allows me to select from, but the app for some reason just doesn't recognize the documentation. Frustratingly, it does recognize new photos, new screenshots.

I've reset my phone several times and logged in and out of the app even more times, but this hasn't helped.

I am a pregnant stay at home mom, living by myself.
I don’t have income right now, and rely on help here and there from people, little bit of money I had, etc. The father of both my children has been paying for the water and power for us to live in his family home instead of child support.

My question is: 1.) It asks me if anyone pays part, or all of the bills. Should I put his name? And if I do, what does that mean: do they count that as income for me? 2.) would it be better to have him send me money for child support instead of the bills diapers thing? Do they count child support as income? 

I have more questions, but I’ll start there. Like a lot of others I see, I have to reapply basically now for March. They didn’t send me anything, but it says reapply online. I t gives me so much anxiety because I desperately need the help, more than ever. I think most people do, which is what’s so crazy about the timing of all this.

10axs9b,Am I Going To Lose My SNAP Benefits Completely?,"I'm in North Carolina. I'm disabled on SSI and I get SNAP. I recertified for SNAP in November, and they sent me a letter saying my monthly SNAP would now be $94 a month.

But as you probably know, starting in January, SSI and Social Security recipients got a large cost of living increase. Personally, mine went from $841 a month to $914 a month. So $73 more per month in SSI.

SNAP sent me another letter at the end of December saying the cost of living increase may affect my SNAP benefits, but it didn't say by how much. It said I could check using the EBTEdge app and clicking on the ""benefits tab"". But I downloaded the app and there's no tab like that in mine. I've clicked on basically every link in the app, and nowhere does it say how much I will be getting in January, or even if I'm getting anything at all. I can see my past benefit transactions, but nothing for the future. So now I'm scared that means that I've lost my benefits entirely because of the COL increase. But wouldn't they send a letter specifically saying I'm no longer eligible?

Is making $73 more a month from SSI enough to wipe out my SNAP benefits entirely?",livecherry,1673625027.0,foodstamps

&#x200B;

Questions:

1. How can provide proof of income? I have no pay stub, pay check at all after layoff. Or what proof of income is acceptable for my case?
2. Is every applicant required to be interviewed? Or just a percentage of (randomly) selected applicants are interviewed?
3. Interview is by phone, on-site, or both?
4. Can CalFresh be retrospective? Namely, if approved, get benefits for past months and future months?

Hi I'm new here. I was having the same problem with checking out, through Walmart Online, with my EBT card.
I found a solution. 

-Enter your EBT card number before or during the transaction under your wallet.
-Go to ""your payment method"" under wallet,
-Then enter your new payment method as your EBT card. Then save.

(This will allow you to add your entire EBT authorized number. Without missing any digits)

-After you've entered your EBT under your payment method wallet, hit refresh
-Now the entire number will show up at the end of your transaction and you will be able to put in your PIN without any complications.
-If you add your EBT number at the end of your transaction it does not accept all the digits on your EBT card. Therefore, causing an error message.

wwkitd,[MN] Girlfriend Left Household. County Is Making It Very Hard to Get Snap Now.,"I had a snap case with my (Now ex) girlfriend and our 2 children. My Girlfriend left our household mid July. She got a job and moved into an apartment in a new county. She left our children, and they remain in the household with me.

&#x200B;

I called the county. Explained the situation and asked if I could simply remove her from the household. They told me ""Sorry no, you need to re-apply."" So, I did. I finished the phone interview. Later the same day, my worker called me and said ""So.... you're not eligible for EBT benefits. Because your dependents are already on another case.... And you can't get benefits for them 2 times. Sorry about that....""

I again, explained to her the case they were on previously, is the exact same address, income, and people. The only difference is my ex girlfriend left the household. She told me ""Well, the case is in her name. She'll need to verify she left the household. Sorry. You can reapply in the future.""

It took the county a month after I reapplied to get the phone interview done. My ex girlfriend moved multiple counties away and got a job that puts her over the income limit for snap.",bigbigboyss,1661350075.0,foodstamps

In the housing expenses, would that their rent cost every month?

Their rent is $1050 a month but in the approval form its showing closer to $500. Their utility expenses in the form is also $400+ which is close but thats only if you count the phone bill as well(258 for 5 lines). Should I call their case worker or are these numbers something else?

vycpqr,Calfresh Investigation,"I’ve been on Calfresh on and off over the years. My renewal came around a few months ago and my bills exceeding my income so a fraud investigator was sent to my house. I refused them entry because I didn’t even know if it was real or a scam. 

My benefits were terminated for not letting them in. I called the welfare office that same day and explained I’m a single mom and I didn’t feel comfortable with letting two strange men in my home. She understood but there was nothing she could do. I was told I could reapply but an investigator would most likely come again. 

So a couple months go by and I reapplied about a month ago now. Had my interview and my income still doesn’t match with my bills but I told them about how a family member gave me some money to help me out with bills. Gave them all of the verification they asked for and a fraud investigator came to my house again this morning. 

He asked me questions about my income and the money I received from family members. He also asked for my landlords number who is a family member. Then he started asking me about my child’s father, I told them he is in jail; which he is. He was in there for 6 months originally, got out for about 3-4 months, and is now back in there for the last month and a half. He went in there for domestic violence against me originally when he served the 6 months, and he is there again because I called the cops on him for coming to my house and violating the restraining order. I know the reason I am being investigated is because my income didn’t match my bills so they assume the father is living here and paying, but he’s literally in jail, although he gets out in a few days. 

They came into my house and looked around, there was nothing for them to think a man is living here or anyone besides myself and my child. My child’s father and I aren’t connected in anyway besides having a child together and the court cases. 

The investigator said I could try calling the office at the end of this week to see if I have been approved for Calfresh..

So my question is, is it looking okay for me? I have had him come over at times to see our daughter because I don’t trust him to take her alone, but he definitely does not live here and doesn’t spend the night. When he gets out of jail I may allow it as well. Are they gonna continue investigating me? Are they gonna stalk my house and make sure he doesn’t come over when he gets out of jail?

v7ahib,(Texas) Was there a recent change in the age determination of ABAWDS?,"Asking for a good family member who I trust and can sympathize with.

For the last 5 years they qualified for EBT Food Stamps based in their age of 50+.  It was lowered from age 55 to 50 back then because people 50+ had practically no chance of getting hired within their trades or expertise, and especially thsoe with other issues. 

Something *may* have changed recently (probably as a side effect of Covid). and now they are, without any explanation and age 55, suddenly required to comply with TWC's E&T program.. They were given 13 days to comply before their beneifits were suddenly cut off after 5 years.

They did explain within the alloted time frame to TWC (Texas Workforce Commission)  the circumstances for which they could not comply within 13 days, but their benefits were still cut off without proper review or notice. 

I've verified enough of this with TWC.  Using their own TEIRS rulebook regarding new procedures, I'm fairly confident that TWC did everything correctly, just that TxHHS did not review the case facts and let it default to the adverse action.

The TxHHS rulebook does now say that persons under age 60 *may* be required to  comply with E&T programs (they actually make it sound the E&T programs are more *stringent*  and strict at ages 50-60, which doesn't make sense).  But there were  previous age limits of 55 and 50 according to outdated Google links as recent as 3 years ago. But any new changes are totally undocumented that I can find. 

It was also mishandled according to all current procedures at TxHHS.  No final notice of determination was ever generated - just benefits cut off.  No chance to appeal. 

Since the cutoff age was 50+, they never had to submit documents to prove a disability.  And now that they apparently don't qualify based on age alone anymore, they were never given a chance to submit documents qualifying them otherwise, And there was never any Final Determination to appeal and extend benefits during the appeal.  It all happened in 13 days.

In the meantime, we have spent 4 days on hold, getting hung up on at least 6 times before we ever get to speak to anyone.  We've used the automated system to be called back when ""our spot in line"" comes up, only to called back by the system and then automatically put on hold again for 2+ hours, and THEN hung up on.  It literally takes 28 button presses and anywhere from 4 to 122 minutes to get hung up on

Now I understand why people go physically and mentally ballistic.  If I weren't here now, this person may have likely gone into the local office armed and dangerous.  And I can certainly sympathize with that to some extent. It's no wonder why we have so many sour, bitter and violent people living in the streets that have totally given up on ANY Government system designed to help them until after it's way too late and Shit Happens.

What rule changes were made in Texas in the last 6 months?  And why weren't the possible beneficiaries/victims notified of anything that may affect them? 

Our main concern is getting their benefits reinstated during the ""appeal period"" which has apparently expired. Which will at least buy them time to scream louder and wider,",spicybeefchowfun,1654643047.0,foodstamps

Where can I find my, is it, ""Individual Reporting Threshold"", [IRT], the amount of income I make less than?

Due to my living circumstances, I'm not entirely able to actively retrieve the mail from the County.  I know there is an amount that if I make more than, the County needs to be tracking.

At least a third of my income goes to my housing expenses (rent) and due to an informal verbal agreement with my landlord (childhood friend), I have no way of verifying the actual dollar amount.

txe96l,"[CA] New CalFresh card is suspended, but I think I know why. Does this make sense?","Hi -- I think I know what's happening here, but hopefully someone can let me know if whether I'm on the right track or not.

A while back I applied for CalFresh, things took forever, but apparently I was approved. No card or confirmation that approval came in the mail. I only found out today when I called for the 23rd time and waited on hold again for another 45 minutes. I was stoked! They told me I could go up to my county office and pick up my SNAP card, so I went and got it. I logged into the account website and it showed benefit deposits for CalFresh. Great!

I went to test out the card, and sure enough, it didn't work. I called customer service, who told me that the card was suspended. A 💡 LIGHT 💡 went off in my head, and suddenly I remembered the weird letter I got from them a few weeks ago, saying that no one had used my account and it was being suspended. I can't find that letter now. I think I ripped it up and threw it away in a fit frustration and confusion. At the time it just pissed me off, since I didn't have a card.

Apparently, they thought I already had a card. Why? I've never had CalFresh before. All this time, I could have been using my food stamps instead of burning hundreds of precious dollars on groceries, dollars I instead could have been using to pay my insanely high rent. We could have been actually having meals instead living on cereal and pretzels and cheap pasta for the past 6 weeks. Anyhow, hopefully this is behind us.

**Does this make sense, and will a quick trip back to the county office get my card re-activated tomorrow morning?**

**UPDATE -- UPDATE -- UPDATE -- UPDATE**

So I went to the county office this morning and they told me that the card wasn't suspended, and that I should go try again. I went home and logged back into [ebt.ca.gov](https://ebt.ca.gov), but nothing has changed.

I noticed something, though. For the past transactions that suspended the card (ACCOUNT AGED  STATUS CHANGED, etc), it says ""Card...1234"". For the recent transactions, including this morning's benefit deposit, it says ""Card..."", with no last four digits. My new card number ends in 6789! That doesn't seem right...

So here's my new question: **Given these findings, is it possible that they've neglected to attach my new card (the 6789 one) to my account, after suspending the old one?**

**LAST UPDATE -- LAST UPDATE -- LAST UPDATE -- LAST UPDATE**

I called them back and waited another 50 minutes on hold. **I WAS RIGHT!** My newly issued card wasn't attached to the case! The phone agent spent about 15 minutes fixing the account and presto -- my balance is now way more than $0! I'm so excited! With today's deposit, we now have 3 months of CalFresh benefits to stock our empty kitchen with!

**For those who run into a problem like this in the future**, be sure to check the food transaction list (again, at [ebt.ca.gov](https://ebt.ca.gov)) where there are entries such as ""Benefit Avail"" in blue text. Click on the entries to reveal another line that says ""Card:..xxxx"". The xxxx is the last four digits of the card it was applied to. If you don't see a number like in my case, or you see the wrong number there, then the benefits aren't being applied to the correct card. Another clue was the food balance, which read $0. Once everything is linked up correctly on their end, the correct balance is shown and a few new adjustment transactions are listed, with a reference to the correct card number!

I hope this post helps someone else solve the same problem someday!

My father has the food stamp and he is asking me help to check how much $$$ he got for every month.

I created the account on the Providers app andcheck the amount. 

I see there are 2 kinks of money add in to the account.
1 is Benefit Avail ( food), the other is Benefit Authorization (food).

For example on this Mar:

03/05: Benefit Avail (food) + $300
03/14: Benefit Avail (food) + $90
03/14: Benefit Authorization (food) + $90
03/25: Benefit Authorization (food) + $300

So, doea that mean my father got total $780 on this Mar.
And he get 4 Benefits per month???

He told me that the previous months and usually just got $300-$400 per month. 

I am wondering that why he get double on this Mar.

Or am I not understanding well enough the statement balance meaning that showing on the Providers?

I was unable to get through to anyone about my stamps by calling. (Always busy etc. run around between card and number and no email provided to contact for help.) So I sent a digital application for food stamps (Never did this before but it was something made possible through their new mibridges site.) with a message at the end (they allow comments at the end) with my current situation and asking them to email me.

I got an email back about an hour later (Wow that was pretty fast.) basically saying I was denied because I share my stamps with others (I do not nor did I ever put that on my renewal application.), that my case worker tried to contact me by phone (I haven't received calls outside of family for the past few months but I do have issue with my phone not receiving some calls.), and that I should have received a denial letter. (I also did not receive this but I did receive a letter saying I was approved for renewal. I should have saved all this to a folder. I'm really dumb for not doing that but I can't even find the information for these letters through their digital site for the denial or approval so I don't really know what is up with that.)

Any other options?","TL;DR: MN EBT customer service won't send me a card, claims they have, but after over 2 months, still haven't gotten any of the four cards that have been issued. Please help, I'm tired of angry crying and waiting on hold.

Sorry, this is a long one, but I feel like the details are necessary so you guys understand that I've tried EVERYTHING. I applied for SNAP for the first time in my life in early November 2021 and was approved on November 15th. The system shows that my first card was issued on the 16th, and the lead time is supposed to be 5-7 business days. I never got the card.

After waiting a couple weeks, on December 1st, I called the EBT customer service line for MN to see what was up. They verified my address multiple times and said I should've gotten it by now, but the mail could be slow. I live in a populous suburb and have been receiving other correspondence from the county/state in the mail within 2-3 days. They said I could either wait a little longer or cancel and re-issue a new card. I waited, but I then decided to call and request a new one on December 3rd. 

December 17th, I called again because I still hadn't received either card. They verified my address again and said that the only option was to wait or cancel and reissue the card again. So I talked to the local post office and they couldn't find any mail that was sent to me from the EBT servicer. I waited another week and called again on the 23rd to have a THIRD card reissued (I found out that each time they do this they've been charging me a $2 fee too btw). So I waited again. 

On January 10th, I still hadn't received any of the three cards they issued. I was fed up and decided to call my county case worker. She tried to be as helpful as she could and checked into some options but due to COVID, they won't let me pick up my card at a county office like they apparently used to in these situations. She said my only option was to call and have them reissue a FOURTH card. Called again, asked if there are any options to track the parcel, and even offered to pay for priority mail, but the rep said this wasn't possible. They also said if I have it sent to another address, the mail will just get returned as undeliverable. The rep said that the cards are automatically issued, so it's not like a person is physically sending it to me. So I had them cancel and reissue the card again. 

Now it's January 20th 2022, and I still haven't received any of the four cards that have been issued. Clearly there's a technical issue or something, but nobody can do anything about it. I have almost $1000 sitting in an account that I can't use, and my savings are pretty much depleted at this point. 

Even if you aren't familiar with MN specifically, does anyone have any ideas of who else (other than my county worker, the county office, or the EBT customer service) I can contact to get this figured out?

My spouse has been supporting me by paying my rent and living expenses (while also paying his own rent and living expenses). In the last few months I have accrued over $2000 in Food Stamps and have spent a total of $350 of them. The reason being was I was scared that they would 1. affect immigration and 2. I thought maybe I was mistakenly approved as I do have a spouse. He technically was not in my household, does not have a social security number, and does not earn an income in the US. 

My Question: Was I allowed to use that $350? Is that considered SNAP fraud as I do have a spouse or am I overthinking it? I genuinely needed those benefits to pay for food (I spent about $70 a month on groceries to try to keep my costs as low as possible)

I am calling to close my case on Sunday when he moves to USA and my household income changes, but I am wondering what I should say and if I have done anything wrong.

rvpj8k,Reporting Income Projections on Sale of Personal Items before they are actually sold - when & how often?,"In my state of Nevada, we are required to report a change in income within 10 days.  That's reasonable, but what threw me was the requirement to report ""projected"" income not yet received, particularly if that is not coming from a predictable source like a wage. 

I plan to sell personal items online but not sure what items and which website and for how much. It's one thing to report these after the event when you know the dollar amounts, but how are you supposed to submit a projection when the item may not sell for months or not at all?  

I was told that just putting up a ""for sale"" sign online anywhere (Craigslist, Ebay, etc.) counts as ""self-employment date"" with requisite ""projected income"" from the day you upload the ad to be reported as ""Change of Income"" when you've not received any funds which will still be used to adjust your SNAP  benefits..?  Then when you don't make the money after a time and you take down the ad for not selling to report again that you did not make the said ""projected income""?  The Welfare advisor said even panhandlers have to submit projected income as way of example.

However, if you pawn an item for cash, that is not counted as income in most cases according to the Welfare counselor, which I suppose is because its considered a loan?  

And putting something on consignment has to be reported even if it may not sell?  

I have health issues that keep me from going out for a regular job and am downsizing to pay my basic bills but this ""projected income"" reporting requirement seems a lot of paperwork on uncertain events and funds since it's not the same as reporting when you actually get the money or a real business with expected streams from accounts receivable.

pz2ubh,Is Orange County California following the $95 a month increase?,"Does anyone know if the Orange County Calfresh Agency is issuing the $95 emergency allotment instead of just raising the excess benefit to the maximum level?  I never got it and none of my neighbors who already got max benefits got it.  The workers at CalFresh haven't heard about it either.

Bassically, all year and last year everyone who was getting at least $1 in benefits was given enough pandemic extra ebt to get them to the maximum amount based on household size. 

&#x200B;

However, people who started off at the maximum amount, or who were less than $95 away from that amount were not getting the extra assistance that was supposed to happen when raising everyones amount.  

&#x200B;

So in April of 2021 the USDA and Biden (i think) addressed this issue by stating that every household was going to get at least $95 a month in emergency allotment.  If you were getting more because you had less benefits to start, then no big deal, however if you were getting less or none because you were already near or at max, you get $95.

  
It seems that the people in Orange County haven't been getting it, or at least the workers I have talked to haven't heard about it.

purgml,Pennsylvania - Elderly parents both on SSI but are they above the income threshold? Lots of conflicting information.,"My parents are both in their 70's, retired, receiving $2700 of SSI ""unearned income"". So they're technically over the SNAP income threshold but it's SSI not earned income so they'd be BBCE (broad based categorically eligible) for at least the minimum SNAP benefits of $16.  My question is - will their SSI amount affect their SNAP disbursement? 

Do they still have to do the asset test? Are their utility, medical expenses considered in this? There's housing repairs they've been putting off because of the fixed income and it all just makes me so nervous for them. 

As BBCE's are they eligible for the full SNAP amount because SSI isn't gross income so their income is just '0'? If so, 1) great and 2) would save me some paperwork gathering as I try to put this app together for them. 

https://projectsharepa.org/senior-box/
PA now has a senior food box program for seniors who make below 130% of the poverty threshold however they don't seem to make the distinction between earned/unearned income. As of April 2021 they no longer require proof of income. https://www.hungerfreepa.org/our-work

I originally applied in July for food stamps with my boyfriend on my case, however I missed the deadline to send in the proof of self employment form.

We broke up during this time and I became homeless but have been staying with his parents for the time being. I reapplied as homeless and during the interview I was told I needed to go the the office to verify my identity with some form of government ID which I don't have right now. 

I got a letter yesterday stating I could have someone verify that I am who I say I am, with a copy of their ID. The deadline is tomorrow. What is needed for this? What will happen when I go? 

This is the first time I'm applying and when I asked someone I know who has applied while homeless they said they didn't need to verify identity so I don't know what to expect.
